# Chapter 35: Rare and Orphan Cancers

Rare and orphan cancers represent a heterogeneous group of malignancies that collectively account for a significant portion of cancer diagnoses despite their individual low incidence rates. These cancers present unique challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and research due to their rarity, diverse biological behavior, and limited therapeutic options. This chapter focuses on five important categories of rare cancers: sarcomas, thymic tumors, gestational trophoblastic disease, adrenocortical carcinoma, and peritoneal and primary peritoneal cancers. Understanding these entities is crucial for medical professionals as they require specialized knowledge and multidisciplinary approaches to optimize patient outcomes.

## 35.1 Sarcomas

### Introduction and Classification

Sarcomas are rare malignant tumors arising from connective tissues, including bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, and other supportive tissues. Soft tissue sarcomas are rare, with approximately 12,020 new cases and 4,740 deaths reported in 2014 in the United States, accounting for approximately 1% of all cancer incidence and representing approximately 2% of cancer-related deaths. Sarcomas are categorically separated by location within the body, with extremity and trunk soft tissue sarcomas (STS) being more common than intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal cases.

Sarcomas are broadly classified into two major categories: bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas, each with distinct biological behaviors, treatment approaches, and prognoses.

### Bone Sarcomas

#### Osteosarcoma

Osteosarcoma, or osteogenic sarcoma, is the most common primary malignant bone tumor, accounting for approximately 20% of all cases. Osteosarcoma demonstrates a bimodal age distribution and most commonly occurs in the extremities. Approximately 75% of osteosarcoma diagnoses occur in patients less than 25 years of age; the average at diagnosis is 20 years. However, in patients 65 years and older, osteosarcoma often occurs secondary to irradiation or Paget's disease of bone.

**Pathophysiology and Molecular Biology**

The diagnosis of osteosarcoma is based on histopathologic criteria and depends on the presence of malignant cells associated with the production of osteoid. Great variability exists in the histologic patterns and degree of osteoid production. Osteosarcomas arise from mesenchymal tissue capable of differentiating toward fibrous tissue, cartilage, or bone.

**Genetic Alterations**

Variants in the TP53 gene are found in approximately 70% of patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), which is associated with increased risk of osteosarcoma, breast cancer, various brain cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, and other cancers. One study observed a high frequency of young patients (age <30 years) with osteosarcoma carrying known LFS-associated or likely LFS-associated TP53 variants (3.8%) or rare exonic TP53 variants (5.7%).

**Clinical Presentation**

The most common clinical presentation of osteosarcoma is pain in the involved region of bone, with or without an associated soft tissue mass. Pain is often attributed to trauma or vigorous physical exercise, both of which are common in the patient population at risk. Symptoms are usually present for several months before the diagnosis is made, with an average duration of approximately 3 months.

**Anatomical Distribution**

Osteosarcoma can occur in any bone of the body. Among young patients, the most common site is the metaphysis of a long bone. Approximately half of all osteosarcomas originate in the region around the knee. The most frequent primary site is the distal femur, followed by the proximal tibia. The proximal humerus is the third most common location.

**Staging and Imaging**

The 2020 WHO classification subdivided secondary osteosarcoma into 6 subtypes: osteosarcoma in Paget's disease of bone, radiation-associated osteosarcoma, infarct-related osteosarcoma, osteosarcoma due to chronic osteomyelitis, implant-related osteosarcoma, and osteosarcoma associated with disorders like fibrous dysplasia.

High-grade osteosarcoma will often be described as having a permeative or moth-eaten appearance with a "sunburst" configuration due to aggressive periostitis or "Codman triangle" configuration due to elevation of the periosteum away from the bone.

**Treatment and Prognosis**

Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%. For osteosarcoma, the 5-year relative survival rate increased over the same time from 40% to 72% in children younger than 15 years and from 56% to approximately 71% in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.

Treatment typically involves multimodal therapy including neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical resection, and adjuvant chemotherapy. The vast majority of patients (about 85 to 90%) with osteosarcoma undergo limb salvage, which involves removal of a tumor from a limb without removal of the entire limb itself.

### Soft Tissue Sarcomas

#### Rhabdomyosarcoma

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a malignant soft tissue sarcoma that is believed to originate from primitive mesenchymal cells that typically differentiate into skeletal tissue. However, these tumors can also arise in other types of tissue and any anatomic area. RMS is the most common soft tissue sarcoma diagnosed in children; only 1% to 2% of these cancers are found in adults.

**Epidemiology**

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare condition making up 3% of all pediatric cancers. However, RMS is the most common childhood and adolescent soft tissue sarcoma, comprising 50% of soft tissue sarcomas in individuals younger than 20. In the US, there are approximately 350 newly diagnosed patients each year.

**Histological Classifications**

Rhabdomyosarcoma is classified into histologic subtypes: embryonal, alveolar, pleomorphic, spindle, and mixed-type. Embryonal is the most commonly occurring subtype and also has the best prognosis. The pleomorphic and alveolar subtypes have the highest rates of metastases and consequently the poorest prognosis.

**Diagnosis and Molecular Features**

The identification of rhabdomyosarcoma is sometimes difficult due to the histologic similarity of the tumor to the other small, blue, round-cell pediatric bone and soft tissue tumors (eg, Wilms tumor, lymphoma, small-cell osteosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma). Therefore, specific immunohistochemistry stains, indicative of skeletal tissue, are usually used to differentiate RMS from other tumor pathologies.

Differential diagnoses can be narrowed for tumors with characteristic RMS findings, including positive staining for skeletal markers (eg, myogenin, desmin, and Myo-D1).

#### Other Soft Tissue Sarcomas

Pediatric soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogenous group of malignant tumors that originate from primitive mesenchymal tissue and account for 7% of all childhood tumors (rhabdomyosarcomas, 4%; other soft tissue sarcomas, 3%). Nonrhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcomas are more common in adolescents and adults.

**Risk Stratification and Staging**

Staging of soft tissue sarcomas utilizes the TNM system as well as tumor grading. The T-staging is based on size and location (i.e., trunk/extremity, retroperitoneal, head, neck, etc.). The size cutoffs for T-staging vary based on tumor location. Certain sarcoma subtypes have a propensity for lymph node metastasis, such as epithelial sarcomas, clear cell sarcomas, angiosarcomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas.

## 35.2 Thymic Tumors

### Introduction and Classification

Thymomas and thymic carcinomas are the most common mass of the anterior mediastinum. They account for approximately 20% of all mediastinal neoplasms. They commonly occur between the fourth and sixth decades of life. No sexual or racial predilection exists.

Thymoma and thymic carcinoma, collectively termed thymic epithelial tumors (TETs), are relatively rare tumors arising from the thymus. Although infrequent, TETs are the most common tumors of the anterior mediastinum in adults.

### Pathophysiology and WHO Classification

The fourth edition of the WHO classification, published in 2015, contains refined histological and immunohistochemical diagnostic criteria and is the most widely accepted cellular classification of TETs. Thymomas arise from the thymic epithelium and consist of epithelial cells mixed with varying proportions of immature T cells.

**Thymoma Subtypes**

Subtype B1 has areas of medullary differentiation (medullary islands) and scattered epithelial cells without clustering (< 3 contiguous epithelial cells). Subtype B2 has more epithelial cells that cluster (3+ contiguous epithelial cells). Subtype B3 is often confused with thymic carcinoma or metastatic SCC from other sites.

**Thymic Carcinoma**

Thymic carcinoma is a TET that exhibits a definite cytological atypia and a set of histological features no longer specific to the thymus but similar to histological features observed in carcinomas of other organs. Unlike type A and B thymomas, thymic carcinomas lack immature lymphocytes.

### Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis

Most patients with thymoma or thymic carcinoma are asymptomatic at diagnosis. About one-third of patients present with symptoms that arise either from the underlying tumor or from the presence of associated autoimmune paraneoplastic diseases. Typical clinical signs and symptoms include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, hoarseness of voice, phrenic nerve palsy, or signs suggestive of superior vena cava syndrome.

### Molecular Characteristics

TETs have the lowest tumor mutational burden of all adult cancers. Multiplatform analyses have revealed four molecular subtypes that are associated with survival and WHO histological subtypes. Pathogenic variants in HRAS, NRAS, TP53, and GTF2I have been observed.

### Staging and Prognosis

Several different systems are used for the staging of thymomas, including the AJCC TNM system and the Masaoka system. The degree of invasion or tumor stage is generally thought to be a more important indicator of overall survival (OS).

Thymomas are slow-growing neoplasms. The most accurate adverse prognostic marker is the invasiveness of the tumor. 

### Treatment Considerations

Treatment typically involves surgical resection when feasible, followed by radiation therapy for incompletely resected or advanced disease. Chemotherapy may be used for metastatic or unresectable disease.

**Pediatric Considerations**

A review of the SEER Program registry from 1973 to 2008 identified 73 cases of malignant anterior mediastinal tumors in patients younger than 20 years. Of these cases, 32% were thymomas, 29% were non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and 22% were Hodgkin lymphomas. Patients with thymomas who were treated between 1991 and 2008 had a survival rate of 75%, compared to 18% for those treated in an earlier era from 1973 to 1989.

## 35.3 Gestational Trophoblastic Disease

### Introduction and Classification

Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a group of tumors defined by abnormal trophoblastic proliferation. Trophoblasts produce human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GTD is divided into hydatidiform moles (HM), which contain villi, and other trophoblastic neoplasms, which lack villi.

The nonmolar or malignant forms of GTD are called gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) and include the invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT), and placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). These malignancies can occur weeks or even years following any pregnancy but occur most commonly after a molar pregnancy.

### Hydatidiform Moles

A hydatidiform mole, commonly referred to as a molar pregnancy, is a rare abnormality in pregnancy classified under gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTD), which stem from the placenta and may metastasize. Hydatidiform moles are characterized by abnormal fertilization, resulting in villous hydrops and trophoblastic hyperplasia with or without embryonic development.

**Types of Molar Pregnancies**

**Complete Hydatidiform Mole**
A complete HM forms when sperm fertilizes an egg that does not contain the mother's DNA. The egg has DNA from the father and the cells that were meant to become the placenta are abnormal.

**Partial Hydatidiform Mole**
A partial HM forms when sperm fertilizes a normal egg and there are two sets of DNA from the father in the fertilized egg. Only part of the fetus forms and the cells that were meant to become the placenta are abnormal.

### Clinical Presentation

The presentation of a partial hydatidiform mole is usually less dramatic than that of a complete mole. These patients typically present with symptoms similar to a threatened or spontaneous abortion, including vaginal bleeding.

**Complete Mole Presentation**
Symptoms include vaginal bleeding in the first trimester, severe nausea, and high β-hCG levels. Late findings of the disease, typically occurring around 14 to 16 weeks of pregnancy, include signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, including tachycardia and tremors, again caused by the high levels of circulating β-hCG.

### Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) includes invasive moles, choriocarcinomas, placental-site trophoblastic tumors (PSTT; very rare), and epithelioid trophoblastic tumors (ETT; even more rare).

#### Choriocarcinoma

Choriocarcinoma, a subtype of gestational trophoblastic disease, is a rare and aggressive neoplasm. The 2 significant choriocarcinoma subtypes, namely: gestational and non-gestational, have very different biological activity and prognoses.

A choriocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that forms from trophoblast cells and spreads to the muscle layer of the uterus and nearby blood vessels. It may also spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain, lungs, liver, kidney, spleen, intestines, pelvis, or vagina.

### Diagnostic Methods

Detection of hCG is also helpful in evaluating trophoblastic disease, including complete and partial hydatidiform moles, postmolar tumors, gestational choriocarcinoma, testicular choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic disease. A total hCG level >100,000 mIU/mL in early pregnancy is highly suggestive of a complete hydatidiform mole.

### Treatment and Prognosis

Most hydatidiform moles are benign, but they sometimes become cancer. For disease that remains after surgery, treatment is usually chemotherapy.

Low-risk gestational choriocarcinoma has almost 100% survival in women treated with chemotherapy, and high-risk gestational choriocarcinoma patients have 91% to 93% survival when utilizing multi-agent chemotherapy with or without radiation and surgery.

## 35.4 Adrenocortical Carcinoma

### Introduction and Epidemiology

Adrenocortical cancer (ACC) is a rare disease with an annual incidence of 0.7-2 cases per million per year and two distinct age distribution peaks, the first occurring in early adulthood and the second between 40-50 years with women being more often affected (55-60%).

Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) are very uncommon; these lesions are less common than cortical adenomas and pheochromocytoma. The worldwide incidence of ACC is 0.5 to 2 per 1 million people annually. However, this neoplasia accounts for 0.02 to 0.2% of all cancer-related deaths.

### Pathophysiology and Molecular Biology

Adrenocortical carcinomas are very aggressive lesions and in some cases may be functional and present with Cushing syndrome and/or virilization. In most cases, ACC is non-functional and presents as an abdominal mass or an incidental finding.

**Genetic Associations**

Although the great majority of ACCs are of sporadic origin, they can also develop as part of familial diseases the most common being the Beckwith-Wiedeman syndrome, the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, the Lynch syndrome, the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1, and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

### Histopathological Assessment

No absolute criteria of malignancy exist for lesions confined to the adrenal gland, but a Weiss score of 3 or higher, which is determined by histopathological features, is generally an indicator of malignancy.

ENSAT has shown that KI67 is the most powerful prognostic marker in both localized and advanced ACC and that higher Ki67 levels are consistently associated with worse prognosis.

### Clinical Presentation

Symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma include pain in the abdomen. A tumor of the adrenal cortex may be functioning (makes more hormones than normal) or nonfunctioning (does not make more hormones than normal). Most adrenocortical tumors are functioning. The hormones made by functioning tumors may cause certain signs or symptoms of disease.

**Pediatric Considerations**

Signs and symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma include a lump or pain in the abdomen. Most tumors of the adrenal cortex in children are functioning tumors. The extra hormones made by functioning tumors may cause certain signs or symptoms of disease and these depend on the type of hormone made by the tumor.

### Staging and Prognosis

The median overall survival (OS) of all ACC patients is about 3-4 years. The prognosis is, however, heterogeneous. Complete surgical resection provides the only means of cure. Five-year survival rate is 60-80% for tumors confined to the adrenal space, 35-50% for locally advanced disease, and significantly lower in case of metastatic disease ranging from 0% to 28%.

### Treatment Approaches

Complete surgical resection remains the primary treatment for localized disease. For advanced or metastatic disease, treatment options include chemotherapy (often mitotane-based regimens), radiation therapy, and supportive care. Treatment of stage IV adrenocortical carcinoma may include chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy, radiation therapy to bones or other sites where cancer has spread, and surgery to remove cancer that has spread to tissues near the adrenal cortex as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life.

## 35.5 Peritoneal and Primary Peritoneal Cancers

### Introduction and Classification

The infiltration of malignant cells into the serous membrane that lines the abdominal cavity, viscera, and coelom in amniotes is termed peritoneal surface malignancy or peritoneal cancer. This condition is categorized into primary and secondary types.

Primary mesothelioma arises from the de novo development of cancer in the mesothelium of the abdomen. In contrast, secondary peritoneal cancer occurs due to the spread of tumor cells from other locations into the peritoneal cavity.

### Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma

Primary peritoneal cancer is further classified based on histology, with terms such as extraovarian primary peritoneal carcinoma (EOPPC), serous surface papillary carcinoma, papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum, extraovarian Mullerian adenocarcinoma, and normal-sized ovarian carcinoma syndrome being used to describe this type.

**Extraovarian Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma (EOPPC)**

Extraovarian primary peritoneal carcinoma (EOPPC) is a malignancy that spreads widely inside the peritoneal cavity involving mostly the omentum with minimal or no ovarian involvement. Most reported cases of EOPPC are of serous histology (serous surface carcinoma).

EOPPC behaves similarly to serous ovarian cancer, often with minimal involvement of the ovaries. Germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene have been identified in approximately 17.6% of EOPPC cases.

### Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma

Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM), on the other hand, is an aggressive tumor associated with asbestos exposure in 33% to 50% of cases. This condition primarily affects older men (60+).

**Histological Features**

MPM is characterized by malignant proliferation of mesothelial cells lining the peritoneum. Histologically, it can present as epithelioid, sarcomatoid, or biphasic subtypes, with epithelioid mesothelioma being the most common.

### Secondary Peritoneal Cancer (Peritoneal Carcinomatosis)

The term peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) generally refers to the metastatic involvement of the peritoneum. The name was first coined in 1931 by Sampson to thoroughly describe metastatic involvement of the peritoneal stromal surface by ovarian cancer cells.

Peritoneal surface malignancy may occur as a primary disease, such as peritoneal mesothelioma and primary peritoneal carcinoma, or as a metastatic tumor originating most often from carcinomas of the ovary, stomach, pancreas, and colon.

### Clinical Presentation

The symptoms of peritoneal carcinomatosis can vary depending on the extent and location of secondary metastatic deposits. The growth of both primary and secondary tumors can exert pressure effects, leading to mechanical intestinal obstruction, potentially resulting in patients presenting with an "acute abdomen" as a medical emergency.

Common presentations include abdominal distension, ascites, bowel obstruction, and constitutional symptoms such as weight loss and fatigue.

### Diagnostic Approach

Diagnosis typically requires cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) followed by tissue confirmation through biopsy or surgical exploration. Tumor markers such as CA-125, CEA, and others may be elevated depending on the primary site of origin.

### Treatment Strategies

#### Cytoreductive Surgery and HIPEC

Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has become the treatment of choice for treating peritoneal metastases from ovarian, stomach, or colorectal cancers. Nowadays, surgical cytoreduction combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS / HIPEC) has radically changed the approach of patients with malignant tumors of the peritoneum.

This involves administering cytotoxic agents into the peritoneal cavity at an elevated temperature (41 to 43 degrees C) to promote their absorption by neoplastic nodules.

#### Prognosis by Primary Site

A median survival of 6 months for colorectal cancer and 3 months for gastric cancer shows a clearly limited prognosis. Results for peritoneal mesothelioma with systemic chemotherapy are similar. The probability of survival is better for advanced ovarian cancer, for which a median survival of up to 2 years is possible.

### Special Entities

#### Pseudomyxoma Peritonei

Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare clinical entity, characterized by diffuse intra-abdominal gelatinous ascites, the so-called "jelly belly," with mucinous implants on peritoneal surfaces. 

It has been more widely used to describe peritoneal dissemination of mucus-producing neoplasm most frequently from the appendix, but also small and large bowel, stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, gallbladder, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.

## Conclusion

Rare and orphan cancers represent a diverse group of malignancies that, while individually uncommon, collectively impact a significant number of patients. The management of these cancers requires specialized expertise and often involves multidisciplinary teams with experience in treating rare diseases. Key principles for managing rare cancers include:

1. **Early Recognition and Diagnosis**: Many rare cancers present with nonspecific symptoms, requiring high clinical suspicion and appropriate use of imaging and tissue sampling.

2. **Specialized Pathological Assessment**: Accurate histopathological and molecular characterization is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning.

3. **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Management typically requires coordination between multiple specialists including oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, and pathologists with expertise in rare tumors.

4. **Treatment Individualization**: Due to limited clinical trial data, treatment often requires extrapolation from similar tumor types and individualized approaches based on tumor biology and patient factors.

5. **Research and Clinical Trials**: Participation in clinical trials and registries is essential for advancing knowledge and improving outcomes for patients with rare cancers.

The continued study of these rare malignancies through collaborative research efforts, molecular profiling, and innovative treatment approaches offers hope for improved outcomes and quality of life for patients affected by these challenging diseases.
