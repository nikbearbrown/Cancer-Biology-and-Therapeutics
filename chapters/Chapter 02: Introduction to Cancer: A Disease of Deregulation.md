# Chapter 2: Introduction to Cancer: A Disease of Deregulation

## 2.1 Defining Cancer: Uncontrolled Growth and Invasion

The fundamental abnormality resulting in the development of cancer is the continual unregulated proliferation of cancer cells. Rather than responding appropriately to the signals that control normal cell behavior, cancer cells grow and divide in an uncontrolled manner, invading normal tissues and organs and eventually spreading throughout the body. In simple terms, cancer is a group of more than 100 diseases that develop across time and involve the uncontrolled division of the body's cells.

### 2.1.1 Cancer as a Cellular Disease

What happens to cause a cell to become cancerous? Thirty years ago, scientists could not offer a coherent answer to this question. They knew that cancer arose from cells that began to proliferate uncontrollably within the body, and they knew that chemicals, radiation, and viruses could trigger this change. But exactly how it happened was a mystery. Research across the last three decades, however, has revolutionized our understanding of cancer.

The generalized loss of growth control exhibited by cancer cells is the net result of accumulated abnormalities in multiple cell regulatory systems and is reflected in several aspects of cell behavior that distinguish cancer cells from their normal counterparts.

### 2.1.2 The Multistep Process of Carcinogenesis

Carcinogenesis can be divided conceptually into four steps: tumor initiation, tumor promotion, malignant conversion, and tumor progression. Cancer usually develops through the transformation of normal cells into malignant tumor cells, often progressing from a precancerous condition to a fully developed tumor.

A central feature of today's molecular view of cancer is that cancer does not develop all at once, but across time, as a long and complex succession of genetic changes. Each change enables precancerous cells to acquire some of the traits that together create the malignant growth of cancer cells.

The stages of carcinogenesis include:

1. **Initiation**: After initiation, carcinogenesis advances through the promotion and progression stages. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the initiation phase is crucial for developing strategies to prevent, detect, and treat cancer.

2. **Promotion**: The expansion of initiated cells through enhanced proliferation or reduced apoptosis.

3. **Progression**: Tumor progression comprises the expression of the malignant phenotype and the tendency of malignant cells to acquire more aggressive characteristics over time.

### 2.1.3 Distinguishing Characteristics of Malignancy

Cancer can result from abnormal proliferation of any of the different kinds of cells in the body, so there are more than a hundred distinct types of cancer, which can vary substantially in their behavior and response to treatment.

**Uncontrolled Proliferation**

When either of these proteins is not functioning correctly, downstream elements are not properly functioning, such as the INK4a/ARF, which encodes for tumor suppressor proteins. However, tumors may grow, leading to cancer in these specific cells.

**Cellular Atypia**

Morphologically, the cancerous cell is characterized by a large nucleus, having an irregular size and shape, the nucleoli are prominent, the cytoplasm is scarce and intensely colored or, on the contrary, is pale.

**Altered Metabolism**

The cancerous cell is particularly characterized by a poor use of oxygen and the massive use of glucose, which is exclusively converted to lactic acid. Consequently, malignant cells take from blood a 5–10 fold glucose amount compared to normal cells and they produce a corresponding lactic acid amount that will be recycled and changed back to glucose in the liver.

### 2.1.4 Cancer as a Systemic Disease

Tumors threaten an individual's life when their growth disrupts the tissues and organs needed for survival.

## 2.2 History of Cancer Research

References to cancer can be found in historical records as far back as 1700 BC, including the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, the ancient Egyptian Ebers and Smith Papyrus, and the Chinese Rites of the Zhou Dynasty. Early mentions of cancer are also documented in medieval Islamic texts and the ancient Indian Ramayana.

### 2.2.1 Early Observations and Theories

Humankind has studied benign and malignant tumors since ancient times, speculating on their causes. Recent findings by Randolph-Quinney et al support the ancient origins of cancer, with the discovery of osteosarcoma in a hominin foot bone over one million years old in South Africa—suggesting that cancer has been present as long as humanity itself.

### 2.2.2 The Emergence of Scientific Oncology

At the beginning of the 20th century, cancer was eighth among the leading causes of death. Infectious diseases were prominent, with pneumonia, influenza, tuberculosis, and gastrointestinal diseases being responsible for one-third of all deaths.

At the beginning of the century, cases of lung cancer was so rare that it was shown to medical students as a condition that the students were unlikely to see again during their medical practices. By the 1940s, however, lung cancer was becoming quite common.

### 2.2.3 The National Cancer Institute Era

In the United States, a definitive effort to combat cancer and advance scientific research began with the establishment of the National Cancer Institute in 1937. This initiative gained further momentum with the passage of the National Cancer Act in 1971.

In 1937 the National Cancer Institute Act established the National Cancer Institute (NCI) within the U.S. Public Health Service. The Act directed the Surgeon General to promote the coordination of research conducted by the Institute and similar research conducted by other agencies, organizations, and individuals.

## 2.3 Hallmarks of Cancer

Currently, the most widely recognized description of the nature of cancer is that presented by Hanahan and Weinberg in two reviews – published more than a decade apart – that identify the "hallmarks" of cancer.

### 2.3.1 Original Hallmarks of Cancer

Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by diverse molecular signatures, yet all share common cellular phenotypic traits and functional capabilities. Hanahan and Weinberg identified these traits as the hallmarks of cancer, which include increased cell proliferation, achieved through sustained proliferative signaling or evasion of growth suppressors.

Second, it is now understood that specific hallmarks of cancer cells cause the clinically evident tumor mass and are fundamental to developing and maintaining the malignant state, including metastases. These include resistance to apoptosis; the ability to replicate indefinitely (immortality); the ability to invade and metastasize; accelerated proliferation, including resistance to growth-stopping signals; and sustained angiogenesis.

### 2.3.2 Emerging Hallmarks

Two enabling characteristics facilitate the acquisition of these traits: genomic instability and tumor-promoting inflammation. Additionally, deregulated tumor metabolism has emerged as a defining feature of cancer cells.

The malignant tumor also has an altered metabolism, including accelerated glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and lipid synthesis.

### 2.3.3 Clinical Implications of Cancer Hallmarks

Moreover, identifying cancer hallmarks has redefined the understanding of carcinogenesis, providing a more comprehensive view of cancer as a process driven by the accumulation of these hallmarks.

## 2.4 Terminology in Oncology

### 2.4.1 Classification of Neoplasms

The most important issue in cancer pathology is the distinction between benign and malignant tumors. Benign tumors usually don't cause much damage and aren't normally life-threatening. But there's no guarantee: Benign growths may sometimes become malignant after some time.

**Benign vs. Malignant**

A tumor, or mass of cells, formed of these abnormal cells may remain within the tissue in which it originated (a condition called in situ cancer), or it may begin to invade nearby tissues (a condition called invasive cancer). An invasive tumor is said to be malignant, and cells shed into the blood or lymph from a malignant tumor are likely to establish new tumors (metastases).

**Tissue of Origin**

Different types of cancers arise from different tissues:
- Carcinomas: Derived from epithelial tissues
- Sarcomas: Arise from mesenchymal tissues
- Hematologic malignancies: Include leukemias and lymphomas

### 2.4.2 Staging Systems

Stage distribution of prostate cancer is affected substantially by the intensity of early detection efforts. Cancer statistics from the National Cancer Institute indicated that between 2014 and 2020, the proportion of disease diagnosed at a locoregional stage was 82%, and the proportion of disease diagnosed as distant disease was 8%.

### 2.4.3 Patterns of Spread

When cancer cells replicate and divide, they don't behave like normal cells. For example, they don't "know" when to stop replicating and when to die. And they don't always stick together. This means that they might break away, move through the blood vessels or lymphatic system, and start growing somewhere else in the body. That is known as metastasis.

## 2.5 Epidemiology of Cancer

### 2.5.1 Global Cancer Burden

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, second only to heart disease in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 606,520 cancer deaths, and new cancer cases in 2020 were expected to exceed 1.8 million. Globally, nearly 20 million new cancer cases and almost 10 million deaths are reported annually.

In the first systematic collation of global high-quality cancer incidence data, in the 1960s, stomach cancer was the most common cancer type worldwide. Stomach cancer is now the fifth most common cancer type globally, with an estimated 1 million new cases in 2018 (5.7% of new cancer cases).

### 2.5.2 Risk Factors for Cancer

More than 90% of cancers are directly attributable to environmental and lifestyle factors, making them largely preventable.

**Tobacco Use**

TOBACCO, through its various forms of exposure, constitutes the main cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide among men, and increasingly among women. Forms of exposure include active smoking, breathing secondhand tobacco smoke (passive or involuntary smoking) and smokeless tobacco.

The most significant modifiable risk factor for bladder cancers is tobacco smoking. Smoking has been shown to increase the risk of developing bladder cancer by up to four times, with mortality from bladder cancer due to smoking is only second to lung cancer due to smoking.

**Diet, Physical Activity, and Obesity**

PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, DIETARY FACTORS, OBESITY AND BEING OVERWEIGHT play an important role as causes of cancer. These factors are affected by gender norms. Because all these factors are intimately interconnected at the individual and contextual levels, estimating the specific contribution of each of these risk factors is difficult and might underestimate the cumulative potential risk.

**Alcohol Consumption**

ALCOHOL USE is a risk factor for many cancer types including cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colorectum and breast. Risk of cancer increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.

**Infectious Agents**

Chronic HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) infection (chronic hepatitis) causes about 52% of the world's hepatocellular carcinomas, resulting in nearly 340 000 deaths per year.

**Radiation**

Exposure to natural radiation is largely a result of radon gas in homes, which increases the risk of lung cancer. Non-ionizing radiation comprises electromagnetic fields like those emitted by mobile phones or power lines and ultraviolet radiation (mainly from the sun), the latter causing chromosomal damages.

### 2.5.3 Cancer Prevention and Screening

**Primary Prevention**

A 19 percent decline in the rate at which new cancer cases occur and a 29 percent decline in the rate of cancer deaths could potentially be achieved by 2015 if efforts to help people change their behaviors that put them at risk were stepped up and if behavioral change were sustained.

**Secondary Prevention (Screening)**

A complementary strategy to preventing the occurrence of cancer (primary prevention) is early detection of cancer through screening (secondary prevention). The fundamental tenet of screening for cancer is that finding the disease before symptoms develop enables detection at a less advanced stage and that instituting treatment at that time leads ultimately to improved health outcomes.

Cancer screening markers are defined as tests. When systematically applied to populations, they identify asymptomatic individuals at sufficient risk of cancer to justify use of additional markers or clinical intervention.

Fortunately, early screening for cancers such as colon, lung, cervical, breast, and prostate can delay or halt disease progression, increase cure rates, and reduce morbidity and mortality.

**Screening Effectiveness**

Of these, only breast mammography, the cervical PAP test, and colorectal FOB testing have been demonstrated to reduce site-specific cancer mortality when applied as a screening measure in the general population.

Since the early 1970s alone, the incidence and mortality for cervical cancer have dropped by approximately 40 percent, a decrease most likely due to increased screening by Pap tests and the use of effective treatment.

### 2.5.4 Cancer Survivorship

Second primary cancers have become an increasingly important concern in oncology during the last two decades, as they now comprise the sixth most common group of malignancies after skin, prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal cancers.

What was formerly a problem primarily in pediatric cancer survivors and for the survivors of the more curable adult cancers has become a more universal problem in the present-day practice of oncology. Survivors of all cancers are living for longer periods, partly because of the more frequent use of effective therapy.

## Summary

This chapter has provided a comprehensive overview of cancer as a disease of deregulation based exclusively on verified sources from NCBI Bookshelf. Cancer cells break the most basic rules of behavior by which multicellular organisms are built and maintained, and they exploit every kind of opportunity to do so.

Key principles that emerge from this exploration include:

1. **Cancer as Uncontrolled Growth**: Cancer begins when a cell breaks free from the normal restraints on cell division and begins to follow its own agenda for proliferation.

2. **Multistep Development**: Carcinogenesis can be divided conceptually into four steps: tumor initiation, tumor promotion, malignant conversion, and tumor progression.

3. **Hallmarks Framework**: The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumours. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease.

4. **Prevention Potential**: More than 90% of cancers are directly attributable to environmental and lifestyle factors, making them largely preventable.

5. **Historical Progress**: In the United States, a definitive effort to combat cancer and advance scientific research began with the establishment of the National Cancer Institute in 1937.

Understanding cancer as both a cellular and systemic disease provides the foundation for developing effective prevention, detection, and treatment strategies. The subsequent chapters will build upon this foundation to explore specific aspects of cancer biology, diagnosis, and therapeutic approaches, all grounded in evidence from authoritative medical literature.
