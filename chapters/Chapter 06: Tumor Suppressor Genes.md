# Chapter 6: Tumor Suppressor Genes

## 6.1 Discovery and Function of Tumor Suppressor Genes

### 6.1.1 Historical Perspective and Discovery

The concept of tumor suppressor genes emerged from converging lines of evidence that challenged the prevailing oncogene-centric view of cancer development. The first insight into the activity of tumor suppressor genes came from somatic cell hybridization experiments, initiated by Henry Harris and his colleagues in 1969. The fusion of normal cells with tumor cells yielded hybrid cells containing chromosomes from both parents. In most cases, such hybrid cells were not capable of forming tumors in animals. Therefore, it appeared that genes derived from the normal cell parent acted to inhibit (or suppress) tumor development.

**Cell Fusion Studies**

The fusion of normal cells with tumor cells yielded hybrid cells containing chromosomes from both parents. In most cases, such hybrid cells were not capable of forming tumors in animals. Therefore, it appeared that genes derived from the normal cell parent acted to inhibit (or suppress) tumor development. These experiments provided the first functional evidence for the existence of genes that could suppress malignancy.

**The Two-Hit Hypothesis**

The molecular basis for tumor suppressor gene function was established through studies of retinoblastoma, a rare childhood eye tumor. Interestingly, about 60% of retinoblastomas occur sporadically (almost always in one eye), and these patients are not at increased risk for other forms of cancer. To explain this dichotomy, Knudson proposed a "two-hit" hypothesis: In the inherited form of retinoblastoma, children inherit one mutated RB allele (germ-line mutation), and the other copy is normal. Retinoblastoma develops when the normal retinoblastoma (RB) allele undergoes a spontaneous somatic mutation; this is the "second hit." In sporadic cases of retinoblastoma, both normal RB alleles must undergo a somatic mutation in the same cell. The probability of this is low, which explains why retinoblastoma is uncommon in the general population.

**Molecular Identification of Tumor Suppressors**

The first tumor suppressor gene was identified by studies of retinoblastoma, a rare childhood eye tumor. Visible deletions of chromosome 13q14 were found in some retinoblastomas, suggesting that loss (rather than activation) of the Rb gene led to tumor development. Gene-mapping studies further indicated that tumor development resulted from loss of normal Rb alleles in the tumor cells, consistent with the function of Rb as a tumor suppressor gene. Isolation of the Rb gene as a molecular clone in 1986 then firmly established that Rb is consistently lost or mutated in retinoblastomas. Gene transfer experiments also demonstrated that introduction of a normal Rb gene into retinoblastoma cells reverses their tumorigenicity, providing direct evidence for the activity of Rb as a tumor suppressor.

Following the identification of RB1, the second tumor suppressor gene to have been identified is p53, which is frequently inactivated in a wide variety of human cancers, including leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas and many other cancer types.

### 6.1.2 General Functions of Tumor Suppressor Genes

Tumor suppressor genes are important genes that act within the genome to regulate several cellular functions. These genes can be broadly classified based on their role in cell growth/cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, DNA repair mechanisms, and other crucial cellular signaling functions such as the apoptosis induction. Without functional tumor suppressor genes, there is a high risk of dysregulated cell growth that is a well-known mechanism for the development of cancers.

**Cell Cycle Regulation**

Two categories of genes play major roles in triggering cancer. In their normal forms, these genes control the cell cycle, the sequence of events by which cells enlarge and divide. One category of genes, called proto-oncogenes, encourages cell division. The other category, called tumor suppressor genes, inhibits it. Together, proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes coordinate the regulated growth that normally ensures that each tissue and organ in the body maintains a size and structure that meets the body's needs.

**DNA Damage Response and Repair**

DNA repair pathway gene defects recently have been implicated in a fairly broad spectrum of human cancers. Like other tumor-suppressor genes, the DNA repair genes are inactivated in human cancers. However, because of their cellular function, it might be argued that they constitute a unique subset of the tumor-suppressor genes.

**Apoptosis Regulation**

A second cellular back-up system prompts a cell to commit suicide (undergo apoptosis) if some essential component is damaged or its control system is deregulated. This observation suggests that tumors arise from cells that have managed to evade such death. One way of avoiding apoptosis involves the p53 protein. In its normal form, this protein not only halts cell division, but induces apoptosis in abnormal cells. The product of a tumor suppressor gene, p53 is inactivated in many types of cancers.

### 6.1.3 Classification and Properties

Based on these original observations, there are three important properties of classic tumor suppressor genes (TSGs): Classic tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are recessive at the cellular level, meaning that both copies must typically be inactivated for cancer to develop.

Cancer-critical genes in general can be classified into two groups, according to whether the dangerous mutations in them are those that cause loss of function or those that cause gain of function. Loss-of-function mutations of tumor suppressor genes relieve cells of inhibitions that normally help to hold their numbers in check; gain-of-function mutations of proto-oncogenes stimulate cells to increase their numbers when they should not.

In the case of the tumor suppressor gene, on the other hand, the cancer-causing mutations are generally recessive: both copies of the normal gene must be removed or inactivated in the diploid somatic cell before an effect is seen. This calls for a different approach, to discover what is missing.

## 6.2 Mechanisms of Tumor Suppressor Inactivation

### 6.2.1 Genetic Mechanisms of Inactivation

Loss of function of tumor-suppressor genes usually occurs in a bimodal fashion, and most frequently involves point mutations in one allele and loss of the second allele by a deletion, recombinational event, or chromosomal nondisjunction.

**Point Mutations and Structural Alterations**

Tumor suppressor genes can be inactivated through various mechanisms:

- **Point mutations**: Including nonsense, missense, and frameshift mutations
- **Deletions**: Large-scale chromosomal deletions or focal gene deletions
- **Chromosomal rearrangements**: Translocations, inversions, and other structural variants

### 6.2.2 Epigenetic Mechanisms of Inactivation

Beyond genetic alterations, tumor suppressor genes can be silenced through epigenetic mechanisms that do not alter the DNA sequence itself but affect gene expression.

**DNA Methylation**

The CIMP pathway is implicated in roughly 15% of colon cancers and is characterized by CpG island hypermethylation. CIMP-related tumors tend to arise in serrated polyps rather than classical adenomas and are often associated with KRAS and BRAF mutations. This demonstrates how promoter hypermethylation can silence tumor suppressor genes.

### 6.2.3 The Two-Hit Model in Practice

Whereas germ line APC mutations are an uncommon cause of colorectal cancer in the general population and are present in only about 0.5% of all colon cancers, somatic APC mutations are present in the vast majority of sporadic colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. This illustrates how both inherited and somatic mutations can inactivate the same tumor suppressor gene.

## 6.3 Key Tumor Suppressor Genes

### 6.3.1 TP53: Guardian of the Genome

The p53 gene like the Rb gene, is a tumor suppressor gene, i.e., its activity stops the formation of tumors. If a person inherits only one functional copy of the p53 gene from their parents, they are predisposed to cancer and usually develop several independent tumors in a variety of tissues in early adulthood. This condition is rare, and is known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. However, mutations in p53 are found in most tumor types, and so contribute to the complex network of molecular events leading to tumor formation.

**Structure and Function**

The p53 gene has been mapped to chromosome 17. In the cell, p53 protein binds DNA, which in turn stimulates another gene to produce a protein called p21 that interacts with a cell division-stimulating protein (cdk2). When p21 is complexed with cdk2 the cell cannot pass through to the next stage of cell division. Mutant p53 can no longer bind DNA in an effective way, and as a consequence the p21 protein is not made available to act as the 'stop signal' for cell division.

**Role in DNA Damage Response**

The p53 tumor-suppressor gene is central in the response pathway to cellular stress. For example, DNA damage caused by chemical carcinogens activates the p53 tumor-suppressor protein by posttranslational modification to transduce signals to "guard the genome" by engaging cell-cycle checkpoints and enhancing DNA repair, and as a fail-safe mechanism, to cause replicative senescence or apoptotic death. Mutations in the p53 gene or inactivation of its encoded protein by viral oncoproteins generally lead to a loss of these cellular defense functions.

**Clinical Significance**

Most of the cancers demonstrate a biallelic loss-of-function mutation in TP53. Uncommon patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have a very high incidence of a wide variety of cancers like breast cancer, soft-tissue, and bone sarcomas, and brain tumors since they inherit one defective copy of TP53.

### 6.3.2 RB1: Master Regulator of the Cell Cycle

The retinoblastoma gene (RB1) was the first tumor suppressor gene to be identified and serves as the prototypical example of Knudson's two-hit hypothesis.

**Normal Function**

Although Rb was identified in a rare childhood cancer, it is also involved in some of the more common tumors of adults. In particular, studies of the cloned gene have established that Rb is lost or inactivated in many bladder, breast, and lung carcinomas. The significance of the Rb tumor suppressor gene thus extends beyond retinoblastoma, apparently contributing to development of a substantial fraction of more common human cancers.

**Viral Inactivation**

In addition, as noted earlier in this chapter, the Rb protein is a key target for the oncogene proteins of several DNA tumor viruses, including SV40, adenoviruses, and human papillomaviruses, which bind to Rb and inhibit its activity. Transformation by these viruses thus results, at least in part, from inactivation of Rb at the protein level rather than from mutational inactivation of the Rb gene.

### 6.3.3 BRCA1 and BRCA2: Guardians of Genomic Integrity

BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) is characterized by an increased risk for female and male breast cancer, ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers), and to a lesser extent other cancers such as prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma primarily in individuals with a BRCA2 pathogenic variant.

**Molecular Functions**

The BRCA1/BARD1 protein complex enhances ubiquitin ligase activity, which is associated with the regulation of centrosome function and involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. BRCA1 colocalizes with BRCA2 and RAD51 at sites of DNA damage and activates RAD51-mediated homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks. BRCA2 regulates the availability and activity of RAD51, which coats single-strand DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament that invades and pairs with a homologous DNA duplex.

**DNA Repair Functions**

Subsequent transducers and effectors include the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1 complex (both transducer and effector), and the breast cancer susceptibility proteins BRCA1 (a transducer) and BRCA2 (an effector). BRCA2 interacts directly with DNA and the Rad51 strand-transferase to help initiate homologous recombination.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are essential for efficient HRR (homologous recombinational repair), but the precise biochemical role for BRCA1 remains unclear.

**Clinical Implications**

Several lines of investigation have implicated BRCA1 and BRCA2 in DNA damage-response pathways. An association between BRCA1 and p53 and the subsequent enhancement of p53 activity incriminates BRCA1 in p21-mediated cell-cycle arrest following DNA damage. In addition, BRCA1 forms complexes with both BRCA2 and Rad51, the human homolog of the Escherichia coli gene RecA, which is essential to normal recombination and genome stability.

**Therapeutic Targeting**

PARP inhibitors have emerged as a promising treatment in individuals with BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast cancer, given their role in DNA repair. Because BRCA1, BRCA2, and PARP participate in DNA repair, their mutual disruption could lead to "synergistic lethality" of tumor cells.

### 6.3.4 APC: The Colorectal Cancer Gatekeeper

The APC gene is large, with more than 15 exons, and alternative splicing affects the 5′ untranslated portion of transcripts. The predominant APC transcript encodes a 2,843-amino-acid protein expressed in many adult tissues.

**Role in Colorectal Cancer**

Among the earliest and most common events in the colorectal tumor progression pathway is loss or pathogenic variant–inactivation of the APC gene. APC mutations have been reported in up to 80% of adenomas and in up to 80% of carcinomas. Functionally, the APC gene is involved in the wingless/Wnt signaling pathway.

**Familial Adenomatous Polyposis**

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant polyposis syndrome characterized by varying degrees of penetrance. The primary genetic defect associated with this disorder is a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene.

If left untreated, affected individuals develop hundreds to thousands of polyps throughout the colon and rectum, often manifesting in the early teenage years. This condition ultimately results in an almost 100% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer, typically occurring by age 40.

**Molecular Function**

The APC gene on chromosome 5q21 encodes a 2,843-amino acid protein that is important in cell adhesion and signal transduction; the main function of the APC protein is to regulate intracellular concentrations of beta-catenin, a major mediator of the Wnt signal transduction pathway.

The APC protein is now known to be an inhibitory component of the Wnt signaling pathway. It acts by binding to β-catenin, another component of the pathway, and thereby preventing activation of TCF4, a gene regulatory protein that stimulates growth of the colonic epithelium when it has β-catenin bound to it.

### 6.3.5 PTEN: A Phosphatase with Broad Tumor Suppressive Functions

The PTEN gene, located on chromosome 10q23, is missing or mutated in a variety of human cancers, including glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer), endometrial (uterine) tumors, and prostate cancer, as well as in Cowden disease cells.

**Molecular Function**

The PTEN tumor suppressor gene acts as a phospholipid phosphatase. Under normal growth conditions, stimulatory signals from the insulin receptor activate the enzyme phosphoinositide kinase (PI3-kinase), which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol to generate PIP3, a key second messenger.

PTEN belongs to a subclass of phosphatases called dual-specificity phosphatases that remove phosphate groups from tyrosine as well as serine and threonine. In addition, PTEN is the major phosphatase for phosphoinositide-3,4,5-triphosphate, and thus downregulates the PI3K/AKT pathway.

If PTEN fails to deactivate PIP3 because of a mutation in its phosphatase domain, downstream signals are not switched off, and therefore PKB/Akt remains in the "on" state. In this case, PKB/Akt can continue to stimulate downstream proteins such as transcription factors and glucose transporters, which could lead to enhanced cell growth.

**PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome**

The PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) includes Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN-related Proteus syndrome (PS), and PTEN-related Proteus-like syndrome. CS is a multiple hamartoma syndrome with a high risk for benign and malignant tumors of the thyroid, breast, kidney, and endometrium.

Autosomally dominant inherited mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN are responsible for Cowden disease. The protein encoded by the PTEN gene contributes to the control of apoptosis and the cell cycle. Specifically, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is down-regulated by the PTEN gene product, resulting in decreased cellular proliferation and survival.

## 6.4 Clinical Implications of Tumor Suppressors

### 6.4.1 Hereditary Cancer Syndromes

There are even familial cancer syndromes associated with the loss of function germline mutations of specific tumor suppressor genes like Li-Fraumeni syndrome with the loss of TP53.

### 6.4.2 Therapeutic Targeting

The understanding of tumor suppressor gene function has led to novel therapeutic approaches:

**Synthetic Lethality**

The concept of synthetic lethality has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, particularly exemplified by the use of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-deficient cancers.

**DNA Repair Targeting**

Scientists used to think that radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs killed cancer cells directly by harming their DNA. It seems clear now that such therapy only slightly damages the DNA in cells; the damaged cells, in response, actively kill themselves. This understanding has led to strategies that exploit defective DNA repair in tumor suppressor-deficient cancers.

### 6.4.3 Diagnostic Applications

In addition to the controls on proliferation afforded by the coordinated action of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, cells also have at least three other systems that can help them avoid runaway cell division. The first of these systems is the DNA repair system. This system operates in virtually every cell in the body, detecting and correcting errors in DNA.

## 6.5 Future Directions

### 6.5.1 Emerging Tumor Suppressors

Enormous progress has been made in the identification of inherited and somatic mutations in tumor-suppressor genes in human cancer, as well as in defining the means by which loss-of-function mutations in these genes contribute to the development of cancer.

### 6.5.2 Therapeutic Development

The recent sequencing of the human genome and the availability of increasingly powerful tools for systematically searching DNA for significant mutations should soon lead to a much more complete catalog of cancer-critical genes.

## Conclusion

A current view is that cancers arise through a multistage process in which inherited and somatic mutations of cellular genes lead to clonal selection of variant progeny with the most robust and aggressive growth properties. Two classes of genes, protooncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, are targets for the mutations.

The study of tumor suppressor genes has revolutionized our understanding of cancer biology and continues to provide insights into cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. These mutations occur in genes that control cell growth and cell death. The activation of protooncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes are mutational events that drive the multistep process of carcinogenesis.
