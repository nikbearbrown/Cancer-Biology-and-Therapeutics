# Chapter 23: Hormonal Therapies

## Introduction

Hormonal therapies represent a cornerstone of cancer treatment for hormone-sensitive malignancies, leveraging the fundamental biological principle that certain cancers depend on hormones for their growth and survival. Neoplasia of hormone-responsive tissues currently accounts for more than 35% of all newly diagnosed male and almost 50% of all newly diagnosed female cancers in the United States. The therapeutic manipulation of hormonal pathways has proven to be one of the most successful targeted approaches in oncology, offering significant benefits in terms of disease control and patient survival.

The underlying mechanism proposed for all of these cancers is that neoplasia is the consequence of prolonged hormonal stimulation of the particular target organ, the normal growth and function of which is controlled by one or more steroid or polypeptide hormones. This understanding forms the basis for hormonal interventions that either block hormone production, prevent hormone-receptor interactions, or disrupt downstream signaling pathways.

## 23.1 Hormone-Sensitive Cancers

### 23.1.1 Breast Cancer

Breast cancer represents the most extensively studied hormone-sensitive malignancy, with approximately 70% of breast cancers expressing estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. Estradiol and, other steroid hormones (eg, progesterone) drive breast cell proliferation, which facilitates the accumulation of random DNA copying errors in critical genes on the pathway to a malignant phenotype.

The hormone dependence of breast cancer was first recognized through clinical observations of the relationship between reproductive factors and breast cancer risk. Relative risk of breast cancer by time since last use of combined oral contraceptives demonstrates the impact of exogenous hormone exposure on cancer risk. The discovery of estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast tissue provided the molecular basis for hormone-targeted therapies.

Hormone receptor-positive breast cancers are characterized by:
- Expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and/or progesterone receptor (PR)
- Dependence on estrogen for growth and proliferation
- Generally better prognosis than hormone receptor-negative tumors
- Responsiveness to endocrine therapies

### 23.1.2 Prostate Cancer

Prostate cancer demonstrates a unique dependence on androgens, primarily testosterone and its more potent metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The prostate is an androgen-regulated organ, and there is little disagreement that androgens are the major stimulus for cell division in prostatic epithelium.

The androgen dependence of prostate cancer was first established by the pioneering work of Charles Huggins. In 1941, Dr. Charles Huggins, a urologist from the University of Chicago, discovered that androgen deprivation (castration) could cause prostate glands to atrophy and lead to the regression of prostate cancer. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1966 for his discovery, which is the basis for all hormonal (testosterone deprivation-based) treatments used in prostate cancer.

Prostate cancer characteristics include:
- Androgen receptor (AR) expression in virtually all cases
- Dependence on testosterone and DHT for growth
- Initial responsiveness to androgen deprivation therapy
- Eventual progression to castration-resistant disease

### 23.1.3 Endometrial Cancer

Endometrial cancer demonstrates a strong relationship with estrogen exposure, particularly unopposed estrogen stimulation. On the basis of the concept that frequency of mitotic activity is the primary determinant of endometrial cancer risk and that such activity is controlled by cumulative exposure to unopposed estrogens, one can readily predict the most important risk factors for this disease.

### 23.1.4 Other Hormone-Sensitive Cancers

Additional hormone-sensitive malignancies include:
- Ovarian cancer (estrogen and progesterone sensitive)
- Thyroid cancer (particularly in women)
- Certain sarcomas and bone tumors

## 23.2 Mechanisms of Hormonal Action

### 23.2.1 Estrogen Signaling Pathway

Estrogen exerts its effects through both classical genomic and non-genomic pathways. Cellular physiological response to estrogen begins in the cell cytoplasm with estrogen binding to either alpha-estrogen receptor or beta-estrogen receptor. The activated estrogen-estrogen receptor complex then crosses into the nucleus of cells to induce DNA transcription by binding to nucleotide sequences known as estrogen response elements (ERE) to enact a physiological response.

The estrogen receptor exists in two main forms:
- ERα (estrogen receptor alpha): primarily mediates proliferative effects
- ERβ (estrogen receptor beta): often mediates anti-proliferative effects

### 23.2.2 Androgen Signaling Pathway

The prostate gland requires androgen (testosterone) to function optimally. Androgen signaling involves:
- Testosterone binding to the androgen receptor
- Receptor activation and nuclear translocation
- DNA binding and transcriptional regulation of target genes
- Promotion of cell survival and proliferation

The biological actions of testosterone and DHT are mediated by the androgen receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, which in response to hormone regulates gene expression in target tissues.

### 23.2.3 Coregulator Proteins and Tissue Specificity

Coregulatory proteins exist in a tissue-specific fashion and are highly context dependent. These features enable estrogen-like compounds called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) to act as an estrogen agonist (activating biological responses) in some tissues, such as in bone and the heart, and an antagonist (blocking biological responses) in others, including the uterus and breast, depending on the coregulator profile in the cells.

## 23.3 Anti-Estrogen Therapies

### 23.3.1 Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs)

SERMs represent a class of compounds that demonstrate tissue-selective estrogen agonist or antagonist activity. The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are a group of nonsteroidal compounds that have estrogen-like effects (agonism) on some tissues (such as bone, skin, heart or vaginal epithelium), but antiestrogen effects (antagonism) on other tissues (such as breast or uterus).

#### Tamoxifen

Tamoxifen is the prototype SERM and remains a cornerstone of breast cancer therapy. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) medication used to treat breast cancer in both men and women and as a prophylactic agent against breast cancer in women.

**Mechanism of Action:**
Tamoxifen exerts both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects depending on the tissue. The drug inhibits tumor growth in breast tissue while acting as an estrogen agonist in bone, which may help prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

**Clinical Applications:**
- Adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer
- Treatment of metastatic breast cancer
- Risk reduction in high-risk women
- Treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)

**Dosing and Administration:**
The ASCO guidelines for Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy of Hormone Receptor–Positive Breast Cancer recommend a daily dosage of 20 mg for breast cancer prevention after the completion of chemotherapy. The duration of therapy depends on the patient's menopausal status and typically lasts between 5 and 10 years.

**Efficacy:**
The authors concluded that the breast cancer mortality rate could be halved with anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen in middle-aged women with oestrogen receptor-positive disease.

#### Other SERMs

**Toremifene:** Similar to tamoxifen but with potentially fewer side effects

**Raloxifene:** Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that has estrogen-like effects (agonism) on bone and the cardiovascular system but antiestrogen activity (antagonism) on breast and uterus tissue. Primarily used for osteoporosis prevention but also shows breast cancer risk reduction.

### 23.3.2 Selective Estrogen Receptor Degraders (SERDs)

SERDs represent a newer class of anti-estrogen agents that bind to the estrogen receptor and promote its degradation, effectively eliminating receptor signaling.

**Fulvestrant:** The first SERD approved for clinical use
- Mechanism: Binds to ER and promotes receptor degradation
- Indications: Advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer
- Administration: Monthly intramuscular injection

**Advantages of SERDs:**
- Complete antagonism without partial agonist activity
- Effective in tamoxifen-resistant tumors
- Reduced risk of endometrial stimulation

## 23.4 Aromatase Inhibitors

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) represent a crucial class of hormonal therapies that block estrogen production by inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Aromatase (estrogen synthetase) is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of monooxygenases and catalyzes the demethylation of androgens' carbon 19, producing phenolic 18-carbon estrogens.

### 23.4.1 Mechanism of Action

In postmenopausal women, the conversion of androgens to estrogens via this pathway in the adrenal glands, the skin, the muscle, and the adipose tissue, is the primary source of estrogen. Aromatase inhibitors block this pathway and consequently suppress estrogen levels in postmenopausal women.

### 23.4.2 Classification

**Third-Generation Aromatase Inhibitors:**

**Nonsteroidal AIs (Type II):**
- Anastrozole (Arimidex)
- Letrozole (Femara)

**Steroidal AIs (Type I):**
- Exemestane (Aromasin)

### 23.4.3 Clinical Applications

**Adjuvant Therapy:**
The review found that aromatase inhibitors used as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer had a small benefit on disease-free (but not overall) survival compared to tamoxifen.

**Treatment Strategies:**
Upfront therapy: In upfront therapy after breast surgery, tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors are taken for five years. "Switch" treatment approach: In the "switch" treatment approach, the patient uses tamoxifen for two to three years, and then switches to an aromatase inhibitor. This anti-hormone treatment takes five years in total.

### 23.4.4 Dosing and Administration

Anastrozole, a selective aromatase inhibitor, is available as a 1 mg tablet, which is to be taken orally once a day, with or without food. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or liver impairment or elderly patients.

Letrozole is also a selective aromatase inhibitor. It is manufactured in 2.5 mg tablets. For postmenopausal breast cancer, dosing is 2.5 mg daily.

### 23.4.5 Comparative Efficacy

Although there were no significant differences between letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane in overall survival and progression-free survival for hormone-sensitive advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women, basic assumptions were not fulfilled for the indirect comparisons and network analysis and so the results must be interpreted with caution.

### 23.4.6 Side Effects

The rates of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and thromboembolic events were generally similar between the aromatase inhibitor and tamoxifen groups in six studies; aromatase inhibitors were associated with higher levels of fractures and osteoporosis and lower levels of gynaecological toxicities (including endometrial cancer) compared to tamoxifen.

## 23.5 Anti-Androgen Therapies

Anti-androgen therapies target the androgen signaling pathway through various mechanisms, including androgen receptor blockade and inhibition of androgen synthesis.

### 23.5.1 Androgen Receptor Antagonists

**Classification:**
Chemically, antiandrogens are classified into steroidal (such as cyproterone acetate) and nonsteroidal (including flutamide, nilutamide and bicalutamide).

**First-Generation Antiandrogens:**
- Flutamide
- Nilutamide
- Bicalutamide

**Second-Generation Antiandrogens:**
- Enzalutamide
- Apalutamide
- Darolutamide

#### Enzalutamide

Enzalutamide is a third generation, oral nonsteroidal antiandrogen used in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

**Mechanism of Action:**
Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor antagonist which binds to the intracellular receptor and prevents its translocation to the nucleus and subsequent DNA binding thereby blocking its activity.

**Clinical Efficacy:**
Therapy with enzalutamide has been shown to prolong relapse free as well as overall survival in men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer who had previously failed other forms of treatment.

### 23.5.2 Combined Androgen Blockade

The concept of combined androgen blockade involves the simultaneous use of medical or surgical castration with an antiandrogen to block both testicular and adrenal androgen production.

Labrie and colleagues originally suggested that following androgen ablation, prostate cancer cells could adapt to decreased concentrations of androgens. They proposed that levels of androgens of adrenal origin were sufficient to maintain the hormone-dependent growth of these adapted prostate cancer cells.

**Clinical Evidence:**
However, on the basis of the findings in 24 of 27 randomized trials and two large meta-analyses, it can be concluded that CAB is not associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in survival over surgical or medical castration alone in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

## 23.6 GnRH Agonists and Antagonists

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs represent a fundamental component of hormonal therapy for both breast and prostate cancers.

### 23.6.1 Mechanism of Action

LHRH analogs are widely used in oncology, and their mode of action is almost completely understood. The mechanism of action of these analogs is mainly based on the inhibition of pituitary and gonadal function, but direct effects on various tumors may also play a role.

**GnRH Agonists:**
Continuous treatment with LHRH agonists causes a downregulation (a decrease in the number) of LHRH receptors and an uncoupling of the LHRH signal transduction mechanism. This results in a desensitization of gonadotrophs and a marked reduction in the secretion of bioactive LH and FSH.

**GnRH Antagonists:**
The principal mechanism of action of LHRH antagonists is the competitive occupancy of LHRH receptors, but recent experimental evidence documents that treatment with the LHRH antagonist cetrorelix also downregulates pituitary LHRH receptors in rats and decreases the levels of mRNA for LHRH receptors.

### 23.6.2 Available Agents

**GnRH Agonists:**
The commercial names and year of approval in the United States of the currently available forms of GnRH agonists and antagonists are: leuprolide, also called leuprorelin (Lupron: 1985), goserelin (Zoladex: 1989), histrelin (Supprelin, Vantas: 1991 and 2004), triptorelin (Trelstar: 2000).

**GnRH Antagonists:**
degarelix (Firmagon: 2008), and relugolix (Orgovyk: 2021).

### 23.6.3 Clinical Applications

**Prostate Cancer:**
Leuprolide acetate is a GnRH receptor agonist, also called a GnRH analog. Initially, the administration of leuprolide causes stimulation of pituitary gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which leads to an increase in steroidogenesis in ovaries and testes; thus resulting in increased estrogen in females and increased testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males.

**Testosterone Flare:**
Initial therapy with leuprolide, goserelin, and similar luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists should be preceded with anti-androgen therapy to prevent testosterone flare.

**Advantages of GnRH Antagonists:**
Because relugolix is an antagonist of GnRH, it does not cause the initial increase in testosterone synthesis that occurs with use of GnRH agonists and generally has a more rapid onset of action.

### 23.6.4 Dosing and Administration

Long acting forms that allow for administration at 1, 3, 6 and even 12-month intervals are available for some GnRH analogues.

### 23.6.5 Side Effects

Common side effects of the GnRH agonists and antagonists include symptoms of hypogonadism such as hot flashes, gynecomastia, fatigue, weight gain, fluid retention, erectile dysfunction and decreased libido.

## 23.7 Steroidogenesis Inhibitors

Steroidogenesis inhibitors represent a newer class of hormonal therapies that target specific enzymes involved in hormone synthesis.

### 23.7.1 Abiraterone Acetate

Abiraterone acetate is a semi-synthetic inhibitor of CYP17, a critical enzyme in the pathway of androgen production in the testes and adrenal glands.

**Mechanism of Action:**
The additional inhibition of androgenic steroid synthesis in the adrenals inhibits the growth of the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells.

**Clinical Efficacy:**
Therapy with abiraterone has been shown to prolong relapse-free as well as overall survival in men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.

**Administration:**
- Requires concomitant prednisone administration
- Taken on an empty stomach
- Monitoring of liver function and electrolytes required

### 23.7.2 Combination Therapy

Because it acts on another step in the pathway of androgen synthesis and action, abiraterone has been used in combination with agents that block androgen receptors such as enzalutamide and apalutamide, but the combination has not been found to be superior to abiraterone alone.

### 23.7.3 Hepatotoxicity

Abiraterone is associated with an appreciable rate of serum enzyme elevation during therapy and with rare but potentially severe instances of acute liver injury with jaundice.

## 23.8 Clinical Considerations and Patient Selection

### 23.8.1 Biomarker Testing

Accurate determination of hormone receptor status is essential for appropriate patient selection:
- Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) testing for breast cancer
- Androgen receptor (AR) testing for prostate cancer
- Immunohistochemical staining with quantitative assessment

### 23.8.2 Menopausal Status

Menopausal status significantly impacts treatment selection:
- Premenopausal women: Tamoxifen, ovarian suppression, or combination
- Postmenopausal women: Aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen

### 23.8.3 Cardiovascular Considerations

The use of ADT in prostate cancer patients corresponded with a significant increase in cardiovascular morbidity associated with AMI and with nonfatal events. Therefore, ADT is linked to a significant negative impact on quality of life. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation is required for these patients.

### 23.8.4 Bone Health

Long-term hormonal therapy impacts bone health:
- Aromatase inhibitors increase fracture risk
- Androgen deprivation therapy causes bone loss
- Bone density monitoring and prophylactic measures recommended

### 23.8.5 Quality of Life

In INT-0015, quality of life (QOL) was evaluated prospectively, and this study demonstrated that while improvement in QOL over baseline was seen in both arms, the improvement was more pronounced in the monotherapy group.

## 23.9 Resistance Mechanisms and Second-Line Therapies

### 23.9.1 Endocrine Resistance in Breast Cancer

Resistance to hormonal therapy can develop through various mechanisms:
- Loss of estrogen receptor expression
- Mutations in estrogen receptor
- Activation of growth factor pathways
- Altered coregulator expression

### 23.9.2 Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer

Eventually, all patients responding to initial androgen deprivation therapy will develop progressive disease as manifested by rising PSA levels, appearance of new lesions on imaging studies, or worsening symptoms.

**Mechanisms of Resistance:**
AR mutations occur in low frequency in primary prostate cancer. In contrast, the cells in the distant metastases and androgen ablation-recurrent prostate cancer often contain AR mutations.

### 23.9.3 Sequential Therapy

ENZ is moderately effective in CRPC patients who were pretreated with chemotherapy and abiraterone acetate. The greater benefit is confined in patients who responded to abiraterone acetate.

## 23.10 Future Directions

### 23.10.1 Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs)

The term SARM (= Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator) was introduced in 1999 in analogy of the term SERM (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator).

### 23.10.2 Novel Therapeutic Targets

Emerging targets include:
- Androgen receptor splice variants
- Estrogen receptor mutations
- Downstream signaling pathways
- Epigenetic modifications

### 23.10.3 Combination Strategies

Future research focuses on:
- Combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors
- Immunotherapy combinations
- Targeted therapy combinations
- Personalized medicine approaches

## Conclusion

Hormonal therapies have revolutionized the treatment of hormone-sensitive cancers, providing effective, targeted approaches that have significantly improved patient outcomes. The evolution from surgical castration and early SERMs to sophisticated agents like aromatase inhibitors, GnRH antagonists, and steroidogenesis inhibitors demonstrates the remarkable progress in understanding and targeting hormonal pathways in cancer.

The key to successful hormonal therapy lies in accurate biomarker assessment, appropriate patient selection, and careful monitoring for both efficacy and toxicity. As our understanding of resistance mechanisms grows and new therapeutic targets emerge, the future of hormonal therapy promises even more personalized and effective treatments for patients with hormone-sensitive cancers.

The integration of hormonal therapies with other treatment modalities, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, continues to expand the therapeutic options and improve outcomes for patients with hormone-sensitive malignancies. Healthcare providers must stay current with evolving guidelines and emerging therapies to optimize patient care in this rapidly advancing field.
