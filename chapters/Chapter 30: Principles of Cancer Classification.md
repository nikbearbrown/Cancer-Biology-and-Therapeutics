# Chapter 30: Principles of Cancer Classification

Cancer classification represents one of the fundamental pillars of modern oncology, providing the essential framework for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment selection, and clinical communication. The systematic categorization of malignancies has evolved dramatically from purely morphological descriptions to sophisticated molecular characterizations that reflect our deeper understanding of cancer biology. This chapter explores the three primary classification systems that form the foundation of contemporary cancer medicine.

## 30.1 Histopathological Classification

### 30.1.1 Foundations of Histopathological Classification

**Definition and Principles:**
Histopathological classification represents the traditional cornerstone of cancer diagnosis, based on the microscopic examination of tissue samples to determine cellular morphology, tissue architecture, and differentiation patterns. Cancer grading describes the microscopic appearance of the tumor's cells and tissue. Low-grade tumors have relatively normal-appearing cells and tissue structures. These tumors are considered well-differentiated. Higher-grade tumors have more abnormal-appearing cells and tissue that is structured abnormally.

**Fundamental Features:**
The main histopathological features that classify brain tumors include atypia, anaplasia, microscopic proliferation, and necrosis. These characteristics form the basis for grading systems across different cancer types. Higher-grade tumors are typically more aggressive and have a worse prognosis. They are described as poorly differentiated. The highest-grade tumors are termed undifferentiated.

### 30.1.2 WHO Classification System

**Global Standardization:**
The World Health Organization has classified CNS tumors into seven categories in its most recent revision of its classification system. Primary CNS tumors comprise approximately 50% to 70% of intracranial tumors, with the majority being neuroepithelial tissue tumors. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) published an updated version of the classification of CNS tumors. There has been a significant restructuring in classifying these tumors, and for the first time, molecular features are included in addition to the previously described histopathological features.

**WHO Grading System:**
The WHO grading system provides a standardized approach across different cancer types. For example, in central nervous system tumors:
- **Grade I**: Benign tumors with low proliferative potential and good prognosis following complete surgical excision
- **Grade II**: Low-grade tumors that are generally well-differentiated but may progress to higher grades
- **Grade III**: Anaplastic tumors with increased cellularity, atypia, and mitotic activity
- **Grade IV**: Highly malignant tumors with rapid progression and poor prognosis

### 30.1.3 Tissue-Specific Classification Systems

**Cervical Cancer Classification:**
The histologic classification of epithelial tumors of the uterine cervix by the World Health Organization (WHO) separates them into three main groups: squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and other epithelial tumors. The majority of cervical carcinomas are squamous cell carcinomas that are classified as either large cell nonkeratinizing or large cell keratinizing.

**Prostate Cancer Grading:**
The Gleason score is the primary initial histologic assessment tool used to grade prostate malignancies and has proven to have significant prognostic value. The Gleason grade is primarily based on the architecture or arrangement of the malignant cells within the tumor as well as other factors such as the degree of differentiation. Since the prostate is a gland, the less glandular the microscopic appearance, the higher the Gleason grade, ranging from 1 to a maximum of 5.

### 30.1.4 Differentiation Assessment

**Cellular Differentiation Concepts:**
Differentiation refers to how closely cancer cells resemble normal cells of the same tissue type. Well-differentiated tumors closely resemble normal tissue architecture and cellular morphology, while poorly differentiated tumors show significant deviation from normal patterns. Cancer cells are usually less developed (differentiated) than healthy cells, and not specialized for a specific task.

**Grading Systems:**
Grading is done to assess how much the tumor cells differ from healthy cells. In many cases, the less differentiated tumor cells are, the faster they grow and the earlier they spread to surrounding tissue. Tumors are graded using the abbreviations G1 to G4: the higher the grade, the less differentiated and the more malignant the tumor is.

### 30.1.5 Specialized Grading Systems

**FNCLCC System:**
The French Federation of Cancer Centers (FNCLCC) grading system is widely used for soft tissue sarcomas. This system evaluates three parameters:
- Tumor differentiation
- Mitotic count
- Necrosis extent

Each parameter is scored, and the total score determines the histologic grade (G1, G2, or G3).

**Ki-67 Proliferation Index:**
An indicator of mitotic activity, the Ki-67 labeling index, is usually below 10% for low-grade gliomas. Histologically, low-grade tumors are well-differentiated and demonstrate hypercellular glia with nuclear atypia and rare mitotic activity. This proliferation marker has become increasingly important across multiple cancer types for determining growth potential and prognosis.

### 30.1.6 Morphological Patterns and Architectural Features

**Glandular Architecture:**
In adenocarcinomas, the degree of glandular formation is a key grading criterion. Well-differentiated adenocarcinomas maintain recognizable glandular patterns, while poorly differentiated tumors lose this architecture and may appear as solid sheets of cells.

**Squamous Differentiation:**
For squamous cell carcinomas, keratinization and the presence of intercellular bridges are important differentiation markers. Keratinizing carcinoma is characterized by cells with very hyperchromatic nuclei and densely eosinophilic cytoplasm growing in irregular invasive nests. Many of these nests have central "pearls" that contain abundant keratin.

### 30.1.7 Limitations and Challenges

**Inter-observer Variability:**
Despite these advances and guidelines, there remains a considerable difference in Gleason grading, even between experienced pathologists. Studies have further demonstrated considerable variation between pathologists in colorectal cancer grading, suggesting the importance of tumor staging for prognosis.

**Diagnostic Challenges:**
It is becoming evident that histopathologic diagnosis is insufficient to accurately predict tumor behavior and prognosis, particularly with the problem of interobserver variability with respect to histopathologic grade. This recognition has driven the integration of molecular features into modern classification systems.

## 30.2 Anatomical Classification

### 30.2.1 TNM Classification System

**Foundation and Principles:**
The TNM Classification is a system for classifying a malignancy. It is primarily used in solid tumors and can assist in prognostic cancer staging. A standard classification system improves provider communication and facilitates information sharing and research across populations. The system is based on assessing the tumor, regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis.

**TNM Components:**
- **T (Tumor)**: Used to describe the size of the primary tumor and its invasion into adjacent tissues. T0 indicates no evidence of tumor is present, while T1-T4 is used to identify the size and extension of the tumor, with progressive enlargement and invasiveness from T1 to T4.
- **N (Nodes)**: Describes whether or not regional lymph nodes are affected. These are lymph nodes that are located in the drainage area of the affected organ.
- **M (Metastases)**: Tells us whether or not the tumor has spread to other parts of the body, forming distant metastases.

### 30.2.2 International Standardization

**UICC and AJCC Systems:**
The TNM classification devised by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) and accepted by the American Joint Commission on Cancer Staging is a world standard. The TNM is based on the clinical features of tumor (T), the regional lymph nodes (N), and the presence or absence of distant metastases (M).

**Global Implementation:**
The Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM classification of malignant tumours is a system based on description of the spread and size of the cancer. It documents the size of the tumour (T), affected lymph nodes (N) and distant metastases (M). The TNM stages are based either on clinical description or on pathological classification (pTNM).

### 30.2.3 Staging Categories

**Stage Groupings:**
The TNM system helps to establish the anatomic extent of the disease, and the combination of the 3 factors can define the overall tumor stage. This method allows for simplification, with cancers staged from I-IV, with stage IV being the most severe stage:

- **Stage 0**: Indicates carcinoma in situ, which is not considered cancerous but may become cancer
- **Stage I**: Early-stage cancer confined to the organ of origin
- **Stage II**: Cancer with local extension or minimal nodal involvement
- **Stage III**: Advanced local/regional disease with significant nodal involvement
- **Stage IV**: Distant metastatic disease
- **Stage V**: Used exclusively in Wilms tumors when both kidneys have involvement at initial diagnosis

### 30.2.4 Site-Specific Modifications

**Organ-Specific Criteria:**
T-values are assessed differently based on the involved anatomic structures. For example, T1 indicates invasion into the submucosa in colorectal cancer, whereas T4 indicates tumor extension through all the layers of the colon and invasion of the visceral peritoneum or adjacent structures.

**Specialized Classification Systems:**
Some cancer types require specialized anatomical classification approaches:

**Wilms Tumor Staging:**
- **Stage I**: Tumor completely contained within the kidney without breaks or spillage outside the renal capsule and no vascular invasion (40% to 45% of all Wilms tumors)
- **Stage II**: Tumor that has grown outside the kidney to some degree, such as into surrounding fatty tissue, but usually completely removable by surgery
- **Stage III**: Tumor which could not be completely removed surgically, cancer spread to regional lymph nodes, or tumor implants found in the peritoneum (20% to 25% of all Wilms tumors)
- **Stage IV**: Tumors that have spread through the vascular system to distant organs such as lungs, liver, brain, or bones
- **Stage V**: Bilateral kidney involvement at initial diagnosis

### 30.2.5 Clinical vs. Pathological Staging

**Clinical Staging (cTNM):**
Based on evidence acquired before treatment, including physical examination, imaging studies, endoscopy, biopsy, and surgical exploration without definitive surgical resection.

**Pathological Staging (pTNM):**
Based on evidence acquired during surgery combined with clinical staging. Clinical staging systems generally underestimate the extent of disease. The inclusion of pathologic information improves staging accuracy and is the basis for most modern clinical trials.

### 30.2.6 Prognostic Significance

**Survival Correlation:**
Cancer staging describes the gross appearance of the tumor. It can include tumor size, invasion, spread to local lymph nodes, or distant metastasis. Some staging systems also include the grade of the tumor. Many studies have demonstrated the value of cancer grade and stage in determining colorectal cancer prognosis. Colorectal staging has been suggested to have the strongest association with survival.

**Treatment Planning:**
The purposes of staging are to (a) plan a therapeutic strategy that is most appropriate for the patient, (b) allow for more intelligent prognostication of the disease status of the patient, and (c) permit comparison of therapeutic results obtained from different sources by different means.

### 30.2.7 Limitations and Future Directions

**Individual Patient Variability:**
While the TNM system is useful as a classification system for carcinoma on a population level, its utility has been questioned on the individual patient level. Therefore, more personalized approaches have been suggested, including adding a molecular classification to the traditional approach to augment its overall utility.

**Integration with Molecular Data:**
The Eighth AJCC Cancer Staging Manual has taken the early steps of acknowledging the importance of molecular oncology. This represents a recognition that anatomical extent alone may be insufficient for optimal patient management.

## 30.3 Molecular and Genomic Classification

### 30.3.1 Evolution Toward Molecular Classification

**Paradigm Shift:**
The advent of the age of genomics analyses has dramatically accelerated the pace of discovery and characterization of susceptibility to cancer and of the hallmarks of the genomic changes that cancer cells undergo, both as consequential events and as a result of the genomic changes in the cancer cells. This has led to molecular-based tumor classification becoming increasingly important in clinical practice.

**Integration with Traditional Systems:**
Studies to determine histological classification and immunohistochemical staining should be performed using the endometrial tissue specimens obtained. In addition to these traditional testing methods, FIGO guidelines state molecular subtyping is encouraged and should be used, if known, to upstage or downstage stage 1 and 2 cancers, depending on the molecular classification.

### 30.3.2 Gene Expression Profiling

**Microarray Technology:**
Microarray analysis has proven to be a powerful method for the analysis of gene expression patterns in human cancer and for cancer classification. It is becoming increasingly clear that while some tumors appear to be caused by mutations in a single gene, most cancers likely arise through the collaboration of multiple genes, none of which, when considered alone, are sufficient for transformation.

**Classification Approaches:**
Gene expression profiling provides the potential to gain a deeper understanding of the complex biological and molecular basis of lymphomas, facilitating discovery of new drug targets and new therapeutic approaches. Supervised methods of analysis are used predominantly to identify the differences at molecular level between known classes (Class Comparison) and to diagnose or "predict" to which class a new tumor sample belongs (Class Prediction).

### 30.3.3 Molecular Subtypes in Specific Cancers

**Breast Cancer Molecular Classification:**
MammaPrint is the first assay based on microarrays that has completed the path from the bench to FDA approval for clinical application. Gene expression may reflect fundamental biological tumor features, and thus be relatively stable across ethnic groups. However, gene expression patterns have also been associated with specific genetic mutations (i.e., BRCA1).

**Gastrointestinal Cancer Subtypes:**
Four molecular subtypes have been identified in gastric cancer (Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive, microsatellite unstable, genomically stable and chromosomal instability) and colorectal cancer (microsatellite instability, genome stable, chromosomal instability, and hypermutated-single nucleotide variant) through comprehensive molecular profiling using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

### 30.3.4 Genomic Biomarkers and Prognostic Signatures

**Multi-gene Signatures:**
Genomic biomarkers have increasingly been developed and utilized in recent years, to stratify patients and predict clinical outcome, for instance, being used as prognostic and predictive biomarkers in various types of cancers. Such genomic assays on predicting clinical outcome may aid physicians in determining a most suitable clinical therapy for the patient.

**Clinical Implementation:**
We identified and validated a novel 53–gene prognostic signature and score system that robustly and reliably predicts overall survival in gastric cancer patients. We also discovered that the predictive potential of the 53-gene signature that can identify gastric cancer patients who may benefit from adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy.

### 30.3.5 Tumor Mutational Burden and Microsatellite Instability

**Mutational Landscape:**
A new type of test that is available for clinical testing is tumor mutational burden (TMB)—a genomic biomarker for cancer immunotherapy that measures the number of mutations in a tumor's genome. Because cancer is a disease that alters the genome, mutational events can range in size from a single nucleotide to an entire chromosome.

**Microsatellite Instability:**
This test analyzes 324 genes and can be used for any tumor; it detects four genomic alterations (base pair substitutions, insertions and deletions, copy number alterations, and rearrangements), tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability.

### 30.3.6 Companion Diagnostics and Precision Medicine

**FDA-Approved Molecular Tests:**
The approval was somewhat different from the other diagnostic tests, because it is a companion diagnostic (CDx) used to predict and inform therapy decisions. This is the first time there has been an FDA approval of a test that also considers what therapeutic drug can be used based on the patient's test results.

**Future Directions:**
Tumor sequencing will become standard clinical practice; liquid biopsies will become available to sample circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); tumor classification will become molecular-based, and tumor-agnostic biomarker strategies may be used to manage patients; and clinical trials in oncology will use sequencing at both enrollment and follow-up.

### 30.3.7 Molecular Classification in Specific Tumor Types

**Endometrial Cancer:**
If available, molecular studies for endometrial cancer classification have become preferable to histologic testing, which is less accurate and more difficult to duplicate. The revised FIGO staging system markedly clarified tumor characteristics for each stage and incorporated molecular analysis data from the Cancer Genome Atlas, which are correlated with prognosis and treatment planning.

**Endometrial Cancer Molecular Subtypes:**
- **POLEmut**: DNA polymerase epsilon mutated tumors with excellent prognosis
- **MMRd**: Mismatch repair deficient tumors with intermediate prognosis
- **NSMP**: No specific molecular profile tumors with intermediate prognosis
- **p53abn**: p53 abnormal tumors with poor prognosis

**Urothelial Carcinoma:**
Multiple classification systems exist for categorizing muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma. Most rely on multi-platform molecular classification techniques such as transcriptomic analysis. High grade muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma can be broadly categorized as "luminal type", "basal type" and "other". The luminal and basal types have different clinical outcomes with differential responses to various systemic therapies.

### 30.3.8 Integration of Classification Systems

**Multi-platform Approach:**
Increasingly, it is recognized that certain subtypes impact patient prognosis and outcome hence the need to correctly recognize and document their presence. Certain subtypes and divergent features correlate with the emerging molecular bladder cancer subtypes, which can also influence patient management decisions.

**Clinical Decision-Making:**
Urothelial carcinoma subtypes and divergent differentiation impact patient outcome and their presence needs to be recognized and documented by the reporting pathologist. Recognition of these entities guide patient counselling and enable prognostic stratification.

### 30.3.9 Challenges and Future Directions

**Technical Considerations:**
It is unknown whether gene expression profiles are more or less likely than more traditional biomarkers to be generalizable beyond the populations in which they were initially developed. This speaks to the importance of validating these tests in populations with varying genetic background.

**Standardization Needs:**
Biological and genetic evidence potentially addressing these issues is expected to become available in the form of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays coupled to expression arrays. This will require continued development of standardized protocols and quality control measures.

## Conclusion

Cancer classification has evolved from simple morphological descriptions to sophisticated multi-dimensional systems that integrate histopathological, anatomical, and molecular features. Each classification approach provides unique and complementary information essential for optimal patient care.

Histopathological classification remains the foundation of cancer diagnosis, providing essential information about cellular differentiation, growth patterns, and biological behavior. The WHO classification system has established global standards that facilitate communication and comparison across institutions and countries.

Anatomical classification, exemplified by the TNM system, provides crucial staging information that guides treatment selection and prognosis. This system's strength lies in its simplicity and universal applicability across different cancer types, though its limitations at the individual patient level have become increasingly apparent.

Molecular and genomic classification represents the future of cancer medicine, offering unprecedented insights into tumor biology and treatment response. The integration of gene expression profiles, mutational landscapes, and biomarker signatures is revolutionizing how we understand and treat cancer.

The most effective approach to cancer classification integrates all three systems, recognizing that each contributes unique and valuable information. As our understanding of cancer biology continues to advance, classification systems will undoubtedly become more sophisticated, incorporating new technologies such as liquid biopsies, artificial intelligence, and real-time molecular monitoring.

For medical and nursing students, understanding these classification principles is essential for effective cancer care. These systems form the language of oncology, enabling precise communication, informed decision-making, and evidence-based treatment selection. As these classification systems continue to evolve, they will remain central to the practice of modern cancer medicine.
