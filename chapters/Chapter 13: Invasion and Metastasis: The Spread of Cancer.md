# Chapter 13: Invasion and Metastasis: The Spread of Cancer

## 13.1 Introduction and Overview

Invasion and metastasis are the most insidious and life-threatening aspects of cancer. The capacity for invasion may not be expressed initially or in all tumors. Those tumors with minimal or no invasion may be extirpated successfully leading to cure in some patients. However, most cancers gradually unmask their invasive potential: progressing over time to frank malignancy from preexisting carcinoma in situ, adenomas, or disorders of epithelial proliferation.

Once the neoplasm becomes invasive, it can disseminate via the lymphatics and/or vascular channels that it induces through tumor-stimulated lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis and other perturbations of the local microenvironment. Invasion and metastases kill hosts through two processes: local invasion and distant organ colonization and injury.

### 13.1.1 The Metastatic Cascade

Metastasis is the leading reason for the resultant mortality of patients with cancer. The course of tumor metastasis entails a series of stages that lead to the formation of secondary tumors in distant organs and is, largely, responsible for the mortality and morbidity of cancer. The metastatic cascade can be broadly separated into three main processes: invasion, intravasation and extravasation.

Once tumor cells acquire the ability to penetrate the surrounding tissues, the process of invasion is instigated as these motile cells pass through the basement membrane and extracellular matrix, progressing to intravasation as they penetrate the lymphatic or vascular circulation. The metastatic cells then journey through the circulatory system invading the vascular basement membrane and extracellular matrix in the process of extravasation. Ultimately, these cells will attach at a new location and proliferate to produce the secondary tumor.

The loss of cell-cell adhesion capacity allows malignant tumor cells to dissociate from the primary tumor mass and changes in cell-matrix interaction enable the cells to invade the surrounding stroma. The metastatic procedure is an inefficient process whereby the vast majority of circulating tumor cells are not able to progressively grow at distant sites. In 1970 Fidler showed that in in vivo models after 24 h, only 0.01% of cancer cells released into the circulation survived to produce metastases.

### 13.1.2 Clinical Significance of Metastasis

At the time of cancer diagnosis, at least half of the patients already present clinically detectable metastatic disease. A higher number of patients will also have micrometastases that would be beyond conventional detection techniques. Thus, metastasis is the most life threatening event in patients with cancer.

The most significant turning point in cancer is the establishment of distant metastasis. The patient can no longer be cured by local therapy alone at this point. The patient with metastatic disease most commonly succumbs to injury caused by cancer dissemination. Approximately 30% or patients still will have clinically detectable metastases at the time of initial diagnosis, and a further 30 to 40% of patients will develop metastases later.

Tumors of comparable size and histology can have widely divergent metastatic potential, depending on their genotype and local environmental influences. Cancer is a disease of signaling, the aberrancy of signaling induced by genetic changes of mutation and transformation as well as the aberrant signaling ongoing in the local tumor microenvironment.

## 13.2 Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a type of epithelial plasticity that is characterized by long-lasting morphological and molecular changes in epithelial cells as a result of transdifferentiation towards a mesenchymal cell type.

### 13.2.1 Definition and Characteristics of EMT

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a morphogenetic event during which cells lose their epithelial characteristics, such as apicobasal polarity, and gain mesenchymal features with an increased migratory and invasive potential. As cells undergo EMT, they lose their epithelial features including loss of their sheet-like architecture, loss of polarity, and down regulation of E-cadherin. The cells also develop a mesenchymal phenotype, taking on a spindle-like, fusiform morphology, become motile, and start expressing mesenchymal markers, e.g. N-cadherin, fibronectin, vimentin.

EMT encompasses all changes in cell morphology from epithelioid to mesenchymal/fibroblastoid/spindle-shaped. A functional transition of fully differentiated polarized epithelial cells to mobile mesenchymal cells occurs. Like metaplasia, EMT occurs in physiological and pathological circumstances, including embryonic gastrulation, tissue regeneration, inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer metastasis.

### 13.2.2 EMT in Embryonic Development

Initially, EMT was observed in embryological and adult development with many well characterized examples including the conversions of epiblast to primary mesenchyme (gastrulation), somite to sclerotome, somite to dermis, myotome to migratory myoblast, dorsal neural tube to neural crest, placodal ectoderm to cranial ganglion precursor, intermediate mesoderm to nephric mesenchyme, lateral mesoderm to connective/muscular tissue, endocardium to cardiac cushion mesenchyme and trophectoderm invasion.

The progenitors of the mitral and tricuspid valves and the membranous interventricular septum in the heart arise by an epithelial-mesenchymal cell transformation (EMT) from embryonic endothelial cells. Experiments using collagen gel cultures to mimic the three dimensional environment in the embryonic heart cushions showed that EMT was triggered by an inductive stimulus produced by the adjacent myocardium.

### 13.2.3 TGF-β and EMT Regulation

The transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is involved in a whole range of biological functions, from cell growth to cell differentiation and apoptosis. The role of TGFβ in epithelial-mesenchymal-transitions (EMTs) has been shown for both embryonic development and tumorigenesis. All three TGFβ mammalian isoforms - TGFβ1, TGFβ2 and TGFβ3 — can regulate EMTs, with distinct outcomes depending on the tissue and on the state of cell differentiation.

TGFβ was first shown to induce epithelial-mesenchymal-transitions (EMTs) in immortalized mammary epithelial NMuMG cells. This differentiation from epithelial to fibroblastic phenotype was observed within 16 hours after addition of TGFβ1 and was accompanied by a decreased expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin, ZO-1, and desmoplakin I and II, an increased expression of mesenchymal fibronectin markers.

TGFβ plays an ambiguous role as it is both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter. Although TGFβ was originally purified from human placenta and platelets, most cells secrete it. Secretion of TGFβ is increased in many tumor cells which respond to TGFβ by enhanced invasiveness. This process, which contributes to metastasis formation, is due to an increased mesenchymal-transdifferentiation in epithelial cells.

### 13.2.4 EMT in Cancer Progression

Although the features of EMT were initially characterized in vitro, studies from patients with a variety of cancers have provided evidence for EMT in vivo. In human pancreatic tumor samples, fibronectin and vimentin are increased in high-grade tumors and within poorly differentiated areas of low-grade tumors, with a corresponding decrease in E-cadherin expression. Significantly, these patients have worse survival than those patients whose tumors demonstrate less evidence of EMT.

EMT has been shown to be a significant contributor to chemo-resistance in several cancers, including in pancreatic cancer. Induction of gemcitabine resistance in previously sensitive cell lines results in development of cells with an EMT phenotype that is associated with an increased migratory and invasive ability compared to gemcitabine sensitive cells.

The results of studies demonstrate participation of EMT in therapy resistance and in the development and maintenance of stemness potential in colorectal cancer. Evidence from preclinical and early clinical studies have shown that EMT markers might serve as outcome predictors and potential therapeutic targets in colorectal cancer.

### 13.2.5 EMT Detection in Human Cancer

To detect possible phenotypic transitions in human cancer, surgical pathology is a useful medical discipline, examining surgical or biopsy material at the microscopic and ultrastructural level. The expression in a particular tumor of epithelial and mesenchymal markers is evaluated by means of immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization, and this could, besides directing to a correct diagnosis, substantiate a possible transdifferentiation.

Whereas EMT occurs in several stages of embryonic development and can be readily induced in (cancer) cell lines in vitro, in human cancer the phenomenon is rarely encountered. Carcinosarcoma is the tumor best studied, in which monoclonality of both epithelial and mesenchymal cell components strongly favors an EMT.

Aberrant de novo expression of N-cadherin has been noted in carcinomas from the breast, prostate, bladder and the head and neck region, where it parallels a downregulation of E-cadherin and a decrease in tumor differentiation. In breast carcinoma cell lines N-cadherin expression is associated with an increased invasion potential.

## 13.3 Matrix Metalloproteinases and Extracellular Matrix Degradation

Controlled remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for growth, invasion, and metastasis of malignant tumors. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of secreted, zinc-dependent endopeptidases collectively capable of degrading ECM components, and there is a considerable amount of evidence that they play an important role at different steps of malignant tumor growth.

### 13.3.1 Matrix Metalloproteinase Structure and Function

MMPs are a family of structurally related, zinc-dependent endopeptidases collectively capable of degrading essentially all components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). There is strong evidence for the role of MMPs in physiological ECM remodeling, e.g., during tissue morphogenesis, growth, uterine cycling and postpartum involution, tissue repair, and angiogenesis.

The MMP family currently comprises 23 human homologs. MMP protein structure is made of specific domains some of which are common to all MMPs. These conserved domains include a "pre" domain which directs the MMPs to the endoplasmic reticulum, a "pro" domain which maintains the MMP in an inactive form and a "catalytic" domain. Most MMPs also contain a c-terminal hemopexin-like domain, which mediates interactions with substrates and in some cases, directs substrate specificity and participates in substrate binding.

Collectively, MMPs can degrade virtually every component of the ECM. Initially, MMPs were thought to predominantly degrade specific components of the ECM thereby providing new substrates facilitating migration and invasion. Since then, it has become clear that by degrading ECM components, MMPs can also modulate signaling pathways from the ECM and modulate the bioavailability of growth factors.

### 13.3.2 MMPs in Cancer Invasion

The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are an important component of cell invasion capability. Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) plays an important role in the breakdown of extracellular matrix and mediates pathways of apoptosis, angiogenesis, and immunity. It has been demonstrated that MMP-1 overexpression is associated with tumor initiation, invasion, and metastasis.

In oral squamous cell carcinoma Snail and Slug are seen to act as regulators of TGFβ triggered EMT, with Snail upregulating MMP2 and MMP9 initiating EMT; while Slug and Snail maintain longer term EMT by stimulating MMP9 expression. The MMPs not only function in membrane/ matrix degradation but are also involved in cell adhesion.

Treatment of MCF-7 cells with MMP7 results in E-cadherin cleavage producing an 80kDa fraction which is detectable in the serum and urine of cancer patients and has been proposed as a biomarker. Similarly, MMP9 appears to cleave the TJ molecule Occludin.

Particular attention has been paid to the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 (gelatinase A and B, respectively), previously denoted type-IV collagenases (72 kDa and 92 kDa type IV collagenases, respectively), since they specifically can degrade type IV collagen, the major component of basement membranes.

### 13.3.3 MMP Regulation and Inhibition

At present, several synthetic MMP inhibitors are in clinical trials evaluating their ability to inhibit growth and invasion of malignant tumors in vivo. Gene delivery of TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4 into malignant cells may also be a potent way of inhibiting tumor growth and invasion. Furthermore, an effective way of inhibiting MMP expression may be blocking signaling pathways mediating activation of MMP gene expression.

Recent observations also suggest that MMPs play a role in cancer cell survival. Furthermore, others substrates have now been identified, the cleavage of which is also involved in increased migratory and invasive properties. Thus, cell adhesion molecules (E-cadherin, CD44, αv integrin) or growth factor receptors (FGF receptor 1, members of the EGF receptor family HER2 and HER4, c-met) can be processed by MMP-dependent proteolysis.

## 13.4 Cell Morphology and Invasion Characteristics

The malignant cell is characterized by: acceleration of the cell cycle; genomic alterations; invasive growth; increased cell mobility; chemotaxis; changes in the cellular surface; secretion of lytic factors, etc.

### 13.4.1 Cellular Features of Invasive Cancer Cells

Microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules appear in different proportions, in malignant cells. The capacity of invasion and metastasizing of the cancerous cell depends on its possibility to move, which is ensured by the actin content. Epithelial carcinomas contain cytokeratins, mesenchymal tumors contain vimentin, and in the central nervous system cells is an acid protein from glial fibers, with a special role in tumor diagnosis.

Cytostatics act by the depolymerization of tumor cell microtubules, which leads to the inhibition of the metastasizing capacity, as well as mitosis and tumor growth. The cell membrane plays an extremely important role in the malignization process. Surface molecular changes, associated with malignization, are able to influence the evolution of a tumor, as well as the host reactions to the lesion.

The presence of desmosomes and tight junctions facilitates the establishment of the epithelial origin of the neoplasm, while their absence indicates the mesenchymal origin. The basal membrane is present in benign tumors, while the invasive growth of malignant cells is characterized by fragmentation, reduplication or disappearance of the basal membrane.

### 13.4.2 Basement Membrane Changes

During the first phases of malignancy, defects are produced with the interruption of the lamina densa. Malignant cells have lytic factors that destroy the basal membrane. The loss of the basal membrane is considered a fundamental criterion of morphological and biological differentiation between benign and malignant tumors. The basal membrane in malignant cells changes its structure or/and ratios between various components, such as: type IV collagen, laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycan and fibronectin.

### 13.4.3 Heterogeneity of Metastatic Potential

Metastases are selectively derived from a genotypically distinct cell population compared to the primary tumor. On average, metastatic cells are much more metastasizing than their non-metastatic equivalents from the primary tumor. So, not all the cells of a primary tumor can metastasize, which is a selective property that only a minority of mutant cells or cell variants possess.

The same authors prove the existence of a correlation between the phenotypic characteristics and the presence of certain genes in the malformed cell with metastatic properties, such as the detachment and mobilization from the primary tumor, the invasion in and from blood or lymphatic vessels, survival in the circulatory system, growth in an ectopic microenvironment, angiogenesis, etc. The metastatic process is selective, and metastatic potential proves to intensify based on a successive selection of neoplastic cells.

## 13.5 Organ-Specific Metastasis

Tumors' histologic, genetic, and pathologic features guide them to metastasize to specific sites. Different cancers have distinct patterns of metastatic spread that reflect both biological and anatomical factors.

### 13.5.1 Lung Metastasis

Metastasis is the spread of tumor cells from primary sites to surrounding structures and distant sites. It is considered a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Distant metastasis is an indicative marker of the aggressive nature of the primary tumor. Metastasis in the lung is a complex multistep process. Metastatic tumor cells undergo stages of detachment from the primary tumor sites, invasion into vessels (capillary, lymphatics), extravasation into the appropriate secondary site, and establishment of a microenvironment supporting its nourishment and blood supply.

Common cancers that metastasize to lung parenchyma include breast, lung, colorectal cancer, uterine leiomyosarcoma, and head/neck squamous cell carcinomas. Cancers that spread to the endobronchial tree of the lungs include colorectal, renal, lung cancer, and lymphomas. Other tumors that can metastasize to the lungs include osteosarcoma and testicular tumors.

Tumors spread to the lungs either by hematogenous or lymphatic route or by direct invasion. Hematogenous spread: seen in tumors with venous drainage into lungs, eg, head and neck, thyroid, adrenals, kidneys, testes, melanoma, and osteosarcoma. Lymphatic spread occurs in 2 ways: antegrade invasion through the diaphragm or pleural surfaces or retrograde spread from hilar nodal metastases.

The lung is the second most frequent site of metastatic focus. It is estimated that 20 to 54% of malignant tumors developing elsewhere in our body would have pulmonary metastasis. Patients with metastasis to the lung have clinical prognoses and treatment options very different from their primary tumor.

### 13.5.2 Brain Metastasis

Brain metastases are a common complication of cancer and the most common type of brain tumor. Anywhere from 10% to 26% of patients who die from their cancer will develop brain metastases. Primary cancers such as lung, breast, and melanoma are most likely to metastasize to the brain.

The incidence of brain metastases is increasingly likely as a result of several factors. Patients with a systemic metastatic disease have a longer survival with new systemic therapies (including immunotherapy) that have recently seen more widespread use. Furthermore, the growing use of sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has contributed to the better detection of small asymptomatic brain metastases.

Metastatic cancer passes through the bloodstream and enters the central nervous system through a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Clonal cells then proliferate, causing local mass effect and edema. Due to the important role of the CNS, there are numerous mechanisms the body employs to protect this sensitive component. Physical and cellular components, such as the blood-brain-barrier and astrocytes, protect the brain from foreign and potentially hazardous infiltrates.

### 13.5.3 Spinal Metastasis

Spinal metastases are the most common tumors of the spine, comprising approximately 90% of masses encountered with spinal imaging. Spinal metastases are more commonly found as bone metastasis, although they are not limited to bone metastasis, and approximately 20% present with symptoms of spinal canal invasion and cord compression.

The most common primary malignancies predominantly metastasizing to the spine include the following tumors in descending order: breast (21%), lung (19%), prostate (7.5%), renal (5%), gastrointestinal (4.5%), and thyroid (2.5%). While all tumors can seed to the spine, the cancers mentioned above metastasize to the spinal column early in the disease process.

Among the routes mentioned above, hematogenous spread through Batson's plexus system is the most common pathway for tumor embolization and spinal invasion. Within the spinal column, metastasis is more commonly found in the thoracic region, followed by the lumbar region, while the cervical region is the least likely place professionals find metastasis.

### 13.5.4 Peritoneal Metastasis

Cancer cell metastasis is a complex phenomenon involving a multistage process and multidirectional spread. Dissemination, adhesion, invasion, and proliferation are significant steps in developing peritoneal metastasis from any primary source. Primary malignant cells can spread to distal sites through local invasion, lymphatics, or blood. In the case of peritoneal metastasis, malignant cells originating from primary abdominal organs usually spread through a transcoelomic mechanism.

The term peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) generally refers to the metastatic involvement of the peritoneum. The name was first coined in 1931 by Sampson to thoroughly describe metastatic involvement of the peritoneal stromal surface by ovarian cancer cells. Since then, it has referred to almost any peritoneal metastatic deposits. Metastatic cancer of the peritoneum is more common than a primary peritoneal malignancy.

Peritoneal involvement is most common with cancers of the gastrointestinal (GI), reproductive, and genitourinary tracts. Ovarian, colon, and gastric cancers are by far the most common conditions presenting in advanced stages with peritoneal metastasis. Cancers involving other organs such as the pancreas, appendix, small intestine, endometrium, and prostate can also cause peritoneal metastasis, but such occur less frequently.

## 13.6 Circulating Tumor Cells

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) represent cancer cells that have detached from the primary tumor and entered the bloodstream. These cells provide insights into the metastatic process and have clinical significance as biomarkers.

### 13.6.1 CTC Biology and Characteristics

In patients, the precise number of CTCs has not been well characterized (estimated 1:1 billion normal blood cells) and only a handful of these cells are considered viable metastatic precursors. Different cell clones, each derived from the same primary tumor, displayed differential metastatic potentials. This study fuelled the notion that only a small subpopulation of CTCs survive to establish heterogeneous metastases.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are frequently enriched in advanced and aggressive tumors, and cells isolated from distant metastases often show a CSC phenotype. CSCs were originally identified mainly using metastatic samples provided the preliminary evidence for the existence of CSCs in metastasis.

The majority of early disseminated cancer cells detected in the bone marrow of breast cancer patients showed a CD44+CD24 phenotype; their relative percentage went up to 65% in metastasis compared with less than 10% in primary tumor. CD44+ prostate cancer CSCs also showed a high metastatic propensity compared with CD44 cells.

### 13.6.2 CTC Detection and Clinical Significance

A higher number of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in peripheral blood indicates poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. The unfavorable count (presence of 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 ml peripheral blood) was associated with poor overall survival in patients with prostate cancer. CTC counts can be used as an accurate and independent predictor of survival rate in patients with prostate cancer.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) represent a biomarker for tumor progression and monitoring therapeutic effects. Changes in CTC count and the pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) for local advanced breast cancer (LABC) patients have been evaluated, though the association between changes in CTC number during treatment and pathological complete response remains complex.

### 13.6.3 CTC Survival in Circulation

The vasculature induced by cancer cells is crooked, leaky and constantly reconfigured. Once the cancer cells cross the blood-brain-barrier, they must survive in the circulatory system, which poses three unique stresses: lack of adhesion sites, strong hemodynamic force, and the innate immune system.

When a cell is deprived of the ECM to use as an anchor, it is programmed to undergo anoikis, a type of cell death. Cancer cells must be able to overcome this innate response to survive in the blood stream. Additionally, the physical force of the circulatory system and the response of the innate immune system create additional survival challenges for circulating tumor cells.

## 13.7 Angiogenesis and Metastasis

Tumor metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related deaths. Tumor metastasis is orchestrated by a complex network of biological events. One such event is the formation of new blood vessels, termed as tumor angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis is essential for tumor progression. Without tumor angiogenesis, most solid tumors remain dormant.

### 13.7.1 Angiogenesis in the Metastatic Process

Apart from supplying tumors with nutrients and oxygen, tumor blood vessels provide a route for metastasis. Endothelial cells are key players in the formation of neovessels. Tumor endothelial cells that line tumor blood vessels differ from normal endothelial cells in many aspects.

The tumor must also initialize angiogenesis, without which the tumor would fail to develop, as local diffusion for transport of nutrients to and removal of waste products from the tumor site would suffice for tumors up to 2 mm in diameter. The blood vessel within the tumor's vicinity can then provide a route for the detached cells to enter the circulatory system and metastasize to distant sites; the process of intravasation.

Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that the process of metastasis is also angiogenesis dependent. For a tumor cell to metastasize successfully, it must breach several barriers and be able to respond to specific growth factors. Thus, tumor cells must gain access to the vasculature in the primary tumor, survive the circulation, arrest in the microvasculature of the target organ, exit from this vasculature, grow in the target organ, and induce angiogenesis.

### 13.7.2 Vascular Properties in Metastasis

Tumor endothelial cells are irregular monolayers, have a higher expression of proangiogenic factors, and impaired endothelial barrier function when compared with their normal counterparts. The basement membrane thickness of tumor blood vessels is uneven and the association between pericytes and tumor endothelial cells is weak, leading to vascular leakiness.

VEGF is highly expressed in tumor endothelial cells (TECs), and because VEGF is a known factor to enhance permeability of blood vessels, tumor blood vessels typically are leaky and immature structures. Tumor cells can enter the circulation by penetrating through proliferating capillaries that have fragmented basement membranes and are leaky.

Angiogenic factors from tumors such as bFGF and VPF/VEGF induce increased production of plasminogen activator and collagenases in proliferating endothelial cells, thus further contributing to degradation of basement membranes. These degradative enzymes may facilitate the entry of tumor cells into the circulation.

### 13.7.3 Metastatic Angiogenesis

Tumor cells that have successfully metastasized may not immediately become neovascularized after reaching the target organ. Such a metastasis lacking angiogenic activity for any of a variety of reasons may remain as a microscopic tumor of 100 to 200 μm diameter indefinitely. It is generally assumed that in human dormant micrometastases (e.g., metastases appearing 5–10 years after removal of a breast cancer), tumor cells are not cycling or are in G0.

One of the important components in a cell's journey to a distant metastatic site is its angiogenic potential. A primary tumor cell must have access to the bloodstream and inhabit an area with blood vessels that can be extended using growth factors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). After the cell extravasates, the metastasizing cell can grow along the blood-vessels for perivascular growth or can recruit new blood vessels for angiogenesis.

## 13.8 Molecular Mechanisms of Invasion

### 13.8.1 Integrin-Mediated Invasion

Several integrins, such as β1, β3, β4 and β5 may be affected by HGF-mediated regulation of integrin avidity. The interactions between bone matrix proteins and invading breast cancer cells are pivotal because bone is a typical site of breast cancer metastasis. Integrins αVβ3 and αVβ5 are involved in bone sialoprotein-induced cancer cell adhesion, proliferation and migration.

It has been proposed that laminin receptors, especially integrin α6β1 are involved in metastatic processes, possibly during extravasation. Multiple binding epitopes on α6β1 may contribute to the migratory and adhesive properties mediated by this integrin. Intravenously injected anti-α6 integrin antibody inhibited the formation of lung metastases of a highly invasive mouse melanoma cell line.

Integrin α3β1 is involved in breast cancer cell migration and invasion by regulating the production of MMP-2. It may also participate in the rearrangement of cytoskeleton. Both phenomena are PI3-kinase dependent. Moreover, the expression of α3β1 integrin is reported to be related to the metastatic capacity of breast cancer cells by increasing the activity of MMP-9.

### 13.8.2 Cell Adhesion and Junction Disruption

Such data shows that HGF disrupts TJ function in human breast cancer cells by effecting changes in the expression of TJ molecules at both the mRNA and protein levels and that regulation of TJ could be of fundamental importance in the prevention of metastasis of breast cancer cells.

Regulation of vascular permeability is one of the most important functions of endothelial cells, and endothelial cells from different organ sites show different degrees of permeability. Tumor blood vessels are more permeable on macro-molecular diffusion than normal tissue vessels. Tumor cells release a number of factors that can assist their transmigration through the endothelium after treating endothelial cells with conditioned media from a highly invasive and metastatic melanoma cell line, with TJ being irreversibly damaged.

### 13.8.3 Adhesion Molecules in Metastasis

VCAM 1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) has been reported in secondary lung masses from breast cancer. It is expressed in endothelial cells. Upon activation, it initiates trans-endothelial migration by binding specific integrins, which in turn induce the activation of the GTPase Ras-related c3 botulinum toxin substrate. The activation of GTPases modifies the cytoskeleton network and facilitates cell migration.

Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) acts as the mediator of lung metastases. It recruits macrophages, which, in turn, secrete epidermal growth factor. This is followed by CSF1 secretion by tumor cells and further recruitment of macrophages. The presence of macrophages indicates a highly invasive potential.

## 13.9 Routes of Metastatic Spread

The general patterns of metastatic spread observed clinically include the following routes: hematogenous, lymphatic, transcoelomic, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is important first to define what metastatic disease is not: it is not simply a primary cancer that is large in size or locally invasive.

### 13.9.1 Lymphatic Spread

Lymphatic spread occurs in 2 ways: antegrade invasion through the diaphragm or pleural surfaces or retrograde spread from hilar nodal metastases. Examples include lung, stomach, breast, pancreas, uterus, rectum, and prostate cancer.

### 13.9.2 Hematogenous Spread

Hematogenous spread: seen in tumors with venous drainage into lungs, eg, head and neck, thyroid, adrenals, kidneys, testes, melanoma, and osteosarcoma. Among the routes mentioned above, hematogenous spread through Batson's plexus system is the most common pathway for tumor embolization and spinal invasion.

### 13.9.3 Transcoelomic Spread

Direct spread to pleura: occurs due to hematogenous dissemination with extension to the pleura, with lymphatic spread, or from established hepatic metastases. Examples include cancers of the lung, breast, pancreas, and stomach. A Krukenberg tumor is a metastasis to the ovary (or ovaries) of gastric adenocarcinoma or another gastrointestinal cancer primary. The route of spread is transcoelomic, involving mechanical sloughing of malignant cells from the primary gastric cancer, followed by migration and circulation through the peritoneal cavity, adhesion, then invasion and proliferation on foreign tissue.

## 13.10 Clinical Implications and Therapeutic Considerations

### 13.10.1 Metastasis Prevention Strategies

Some neoplasms produce early metastases almost constantly, such as: osteosarcomas, tonsillar carcinomas, oropharyngeal melanomas, splenic sarcomas, etc. In other cancers, metastases are exceptional and occur at a late stage. This is the case of the basocellular epithelioma, Sticker's sarcoma, seminoma, etc.

It should be mentioned that only a small part of the tumor cells that reach blood circulation have metastatic properties, and only when they find favorable conditions. Depending on the metastasizing subclone, the cellular structure of metastases is similar or different, compared to the primary tumor. The involvement of the host tissue in the development of a tumor is strongly expressed by the growth rhythm and the possibilities of tumor metastasizing.

### 13.10.2 Staging and Prognosis

The system of cancer staging codifies and describes for each type of cancer the extent of tumor spread. A truly effective cancer staging system not only aids in the description of the extent of the cancer, but also will provide prognostic information (likelihood of cure) and will thus influence therapeutic decision-making.

For every distinct type of cancer based on the organ of origin and histology, there is a distinct staging formula using the TNM staging system. T represents tumor size or depth of invasion; N represents lymph node involvement, M represents distant metastases. The size of the primary tumor does have an effect on the likelihood of future metastases.

### 13.10.3 Therapeutic Targets

A number of studies suggest that distinct TGFβ signaling pathways regulate growth inhibition and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition. This raises the fascinating possibility that antagonists specific for the EMT pathway might be generated, that do not affect the control of cell proliferation. Under such circumstances, one could envision drugs for cancer therapy which would provide a block to metastasis spreading, while keeping the powerful capacity of TGFβ to control cell proliferation.

However, the complex heterogeneity of tumors and the reversible plasticity of EMT, which is fundamental for tumor progression and drug resistance, are principal obstacles in the reproduction of clinical cancer progression. Therefore, further research to establish new biomarkers for EMT, with special emphasis on partial EMT as well as a better understanding of how EMT and therapy resistance are interconnected, is imperative for the development of new therapeutic approaches.

## Conclusion

Invasion and metastasis represent the most lethal aspects of cancer, involving complex biological processes that transform cancer cells from localized growths into disseminated disease. The metastatic cascade involves multiple steps including local invasion, intravasation, survival in circulation, extravasation, and colonization of distant sites. Each step is regulated by intricate molecular mechanisms involving epithelial-mesenchymal transition, matrix metalloproteinases, angiogenesis, and cell adhesion systems.

Understanding these mechanisms has revealed that metastasis is an inefficient process, with only a small fraction of disseminated cells successfully establishing secondary tumors. However, those cells that do succeed in metastasizing are responsible for the majority of cancer-related deaths. The heterogeneity of metastatic cells, their plasticity, and their adaptation to diverse microenvironments present significant challenges for therapeutic intervention.

Current research continues to identify new therapeutic targets within the metastatic cascade, with particular focus on preventing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, inhibiting matrix degradation, targeting circulating tumor cells, and disrupting the angiogenic processes that support metastatic growth. As our understanding of metastatic biology continues to evolve, these insights offer hope for developing more effective strategies to prevent and treat metastatic disease.
