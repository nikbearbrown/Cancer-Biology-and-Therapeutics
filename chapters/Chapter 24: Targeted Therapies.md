# Chapter 24: Targeted Therapies

## Introduction

Targeted therapies represent a revolutionary approach in cancer treatment, moving away from broadly cytotoxic agents toward drugs that specifically target the molecular abnormalities of cancer cells. They are unique and represent a major advance in cancer chemotherapy, away from broadly cytotoxic agents and towards drugs that specifically target the molecular abnormalities of cancer cells. The development of targeted therapies has been one of the most significant medical breakthroughs of the 21st century, offering improved therapeutic efficacy with reduced systemic toxicity compared to traditional chemotherapy.

The concept of targeted therapy is based on the understanding that cancer cells harbor specific genetic alterations, protein overexpression, or pathway dysregulation that distinguish them from normal cells. These molecular abnormalities create dependencies that can be exploited therapeutically. The potent activity and lack of generalized toxicity of targeted therapies relate to the specificity of the antagonist for the mutated protein. In like manner, their toxicity often relates to off-target activity, either to the unmutated kinase or to closely related, normal kinases.

## 24.1 Principles of Molecular Targeted Therapy

### 24.1.1 Fundamental Concepts

Targeted therapies work through several fundamental mechanisms:

**Oncogene addiction:** Cancer cells often become dependent on specific oncogenes for their survival and proliferation. This dependency, termed "oncogene addiction," creates a therapeutic vulnerability that can be exploited with targeted agents.

**Synthetic lethality:** Some targeted therapies exploit the concept of synthetic lethality, where the combination of defects in two genes results in cell death, while a defect in only one gene is compatible with cell survival.

**Pathway dependence:** Whether a cancer can be treated effectively with a targeted therapy may depend largely on the extent to which the growth of the tumor cells is dependent on the targeted pathway(s).

### 24.1.2 Target Validation and Selection

The selection of appropriate targets is crucial for the success of targeted therapy:

**Genetic mechanisms of activation:** The most attractive cancers for targeted therapy are those diseases in which there is a genomic mechanism of target activation. These include:
- Gene amplification
- Chromosomal translocations
- Activating mutations
- Tumor suppressor gene inactivation

**Pathway dependency:** The clinical effect of targeted therapy depends on the extent to which tumor cells depend on the targeted pathway. Monotherapy with a targeted agent may be most useful in the earlier stages of disease, if activation of a specific pathway is critical to the development of the tumor.

**Biomarker identification:** Accurate identification of patients who will benefit from targeted therapy requires reliable biomarkers. These may include:
- Protein expression levels
- Gene amplification status
- Mutation analysis
- Pathway activation signatures

### 24.1.3 Therapeutic Window and Selectivity

The therapeutic success of targeted agents depends on achieving selectivity between cancer cells and normal cells. This selectivity can be achieved through:

**Differential target expression:** Cancer cells may express higher levels of the target protein than normal cells.

**Mutational selectivity:** Some targeted agents preferentially inhibit mutated forms of proteins over wild-type versions.

**Tissue-specific expression:** Some targets are primarily expressed in specific tissue types, allowing for more selective targeting.

## 24.2 Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)

### 24.2.1 Overview and Classification

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors represent the largest and most successful class of targeted therapies. Protein kinases are ubiquitous intracellular and cell surface proteins that play critical roles in cell signaling pathways involved in metabolism, injury responses, adaptation, growth and differentiation. They act by adding a phosphate group to a protein (phosphorylation), usually on a specific amino acid which often makes the protein or enzyme "active".

The human genome has more than 500 protein kinases and they can be classified as:
1. Tyrosine kinases
2. Serine-threonine kinases
3. Nonspecific kinases (both tyrosine and serine-threonine)

### 24.2.2 Mechanism of Action

TKIs disrupt signal transduction pathways of protein kinases by several modes of inhibition:

**ATP-competitive inhibition:** Most TKIs compete with ATP for binding to the active site of the kinase domain.

**Allosteric inhibition:** Some TKIs bind to sites other than the active site, causing conformational changes that inhibit kinase activity.

**Covalent inhibition:** Certain TKIs form covalent bonds with specific amino acid residues in the kinase domain, leading to irreversible inhibition.

### 24.2.3 Major Classes of TKIs

#### Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors

**EGFR Inhibitors:**
- Erlotinib: The most common drugs that cause tyrosine kinase inhibitor keratitis are the medications that inhibit the TKI receptor in the EGFR pathway, such as cetuximab, afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib.
- Gefitinib: A tyrosine kinase inhibitor that actively inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor, approved as first-line treatment for patients diagnosed with NSCLC who had sensitizing EGFR mutations.
- Afatinib: An irreversible EGFR inhibitor that targets multiple ErbB family members.

**HER2 Inhibitors:**
- Lapatinib: A dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor used in HER2-positive breast cancer.

**BCR-ABL Inhibitors:**
- Imatinib: The first successful TKI, targeting the BCR-ABL fusion protein in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Around 1 in every 40 human genes codes for a protein kinase and nearly half of those genes map to either disease loci or cancer amplicons. Interest in protein kinase inhibitors began with the FDA approval of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib in 2001.
- Dasatinib: A second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor effective against many imatinib-resistant mutants.
- Nilotinib: Another second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor with improved potency.

**Multi-targeted Kinase Inhibitors:**
- Sunitinib: Targets multiple kinases including VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-KIT.
- Sorafenib: Targets RAF, VEGFR, and PDGFR, among others.

### 24.2.4 Clinical Applications

TKIs have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in various cancer types:

**Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML):** Imatinib was the first TKI approved for CML patients with the Philadelphia chromosome. It seems increasingly likely that CML, whose diagnosis was once a death sentence, will soon be a disease that is controlled, if not cured, by available targeted therapies.

**Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):** EGFR inhibitors have shown significant efficacy in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. About 10 percent of patients with advanced lung cancer showed good initial responses to EGFR inhibitors like gefitinib.

**Hepatocellular Carcinoma:** Sorafenib was the first drug approved for advanced HCC based on improved overall survival. More recently, lenvatinib has been approved as an alternative first-line agent.

### 24.2.5 Resistance Mechanisms

Despite initial efficacy, resistance to TKIs is common:

**Primary resistance:** Some patients do not respond to TKIs from the start, often due to:
- Lack of target dependence
- Presence of resistance mutations
- Activation of alternative pathways

**Acquired resistance:** Patients who initially respond may develop resistance through:
- Secondary mutations in the target kinase
- Bypass signaling pathways
- Phenotypic changes in cancer cells

## 24.3 Monoclonal Antibodies

### 24.3.1 Overview and Development

Monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized cancer therapy by providing highly specific targeting of cancer-associated antigens. Following the initial report of Kohler and Milstein, monoclonal antibody technology has exerted a prompt and substantial impact on laboratory investigation. Over the last 25 years, the availability of monoclonal reagents has permitted the development of novel markers for in vitro applications and application for the in vivo treatment of human cancer.

As of 2022, more than 80 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have been approved for use in the United States. Modern-day medicine has been revolutionized to be personalized and specific based on individualized specific disease characteristics. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a prime example of personalized therapeutics enabled by advances in our knowledge of immunology, molecular biology, and biochemistry.

### 24.3.2 Mechanisms of Action

Monoclonal antibodies exert their therapeutic effects through several mechanisms:

**Direct cytotoxicity:** Antibodies can directly induce cell death through:
- Apoptosis induction
- Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)
- Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)

**Receptor blocking:** Antibodies can block:
- Growth factor receptors
- Immune checkpoint receptors
- Adhesion molecules

**Immune system activation:** Antibodies can:

- Activate complement cascade
- Present tumor antigens to immune cells

### 24.3.3 Major Classes of Therapeutic Antibodies

#### Naked Antibodies

**Anti-HER2 Antibodies:**
- Trastuzumab (Herceptin): Targets HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. The humanized murine anti-HER-2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab produced objective regression of recurrent breast carcinoma in 12 to 15% of 269 heavily pretreated women.
- Pertuzumab: Another anti-HER2 antibody with a different binding site.

**Anti-CD20 Antibodies:**
- Rituximab: Revolutionized treatment of B-cell lymphomas. In cancer cells, cross-linking CD20 can induce cell cycle arrest, inhibit DNA synthesis, activate caspases, and induce apoptosis.
- Ofatumumab: A fully human anti-CD20 antibody.

**Anti-VEGF Antibodies:**
- Bevacizumab: The prototype anti-angiogenic antibody targeting VEGF-A.

#### Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs)

ADCs combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic drugs:

**Components of ADCs:**

### 24.3.5 Resistance Mechanisms

**Antigen loss or alteration:** Cancer cells may lose expression of the target antigen or alter its structure.

**Immune system evasion:** Tumors may develop mechanisms to avoid immune recognition.

**Complement resistance:** Some cancers upregulate complement resistance proteins.

## 24.4 PARP Inhibitors

### 24.4.1 Overview and Mechanism

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors represent a successful example of synthetic lethality in cancer therapy. PARP-1 is one of the earliest nuclear enzymes to be targeted for degradation by caspases during apoptosis. The subcellular localization of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (now called PARP-1) in the nucleus and its enzymatic activation by DNA strand breaks immediately suggested that this modification should represent an important mechanism of DNA repair.

PARP inhibitors work by:
**DNA repair interference:** PARP-1 is essential for single-strand DNA break repair. When PARP is inhibited, single-strand breaks persist and can be converted to double-strand breaks during DNA replication.

**Synthetic lethality:** In cells with defective homologous recombination (such as BRCA-mutated cells), PARP inhibition leads to synthetic lethality because the cells cannot repair DNA double-strand breaks effectively.

### 24.4.2 Clinical Applications

**Ovarian Cancer:** PARP inhibitors have shown significant efficacy in BRCA-mutated ovarian cancers:
- Olaparib: The first PARP inhibitor approved for clinical use
- Rucaparib: Another PARP inhibitor with similar efficacy
- Niraparib: Approved for maintenance therapy

**Breast Cancer:** PARP inhibitors are effective in BRCA-mutated breast cancers:
- Olaparib for BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer
- Talazoparib for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer

**Prostate Cancer:** Recent approvals include:
- Olaparib for BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer

### 24.4.3 Resistance Mechanisms

**Restoration of homologous recombination:** Cancer cells may restore DNA repair capability through:
- Reversion mutations in BRCA genes
- Upregulation of DNA repair genes

**PARP expression changes:** Tumors may alter PARP expression levels.

**Drug efflux:** Increased drug efflux can reduce intracellular drug concentrations.

## 24.5 CDK Inhibitors

### 24.5.1 Overview and Cell Cycle Regulation

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are essential regulators of the cell cycle and transcription. CDK activity is highly regulated in cells through multiple mechanisms:
1. Binding to cyclin proteins for activation
2. Inhibition by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs)
3. Inhibitory phosphorylation in the ATP-binding pocket
4. Activating phosphorylation in the T-loop

The cyclin kinases 4 and 6 regulate the cellular transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle acting through the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) pathway.

### 24.5.2 CDK4/6 Inhibitors

**Palbociclib:** The first CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for clinical use. Palbociclib is an orally available, specific inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases that is used in combination with aromatase inhibitors in the therapy of postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer that is positive for the estrogen receptor (ER+), but negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-).

**Ribociclib:** A unique cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that is used in combination with aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer.

**Abemaciclib:** A selective CDK4/6 inhibitor with activity as monotherapy and in combination with endocrine therapy.

### 24.5.3 Mechanism of Action

CDK4/6 inhibitors work by:
**Cell cycle arrest:** Inhibition of CDK4/6 prevents phosphorylation of Rb protein, leading to G1/S cell cycle arrest.

**Senescence induction:** Prolonged CDK4/6 inhibition can lead to cellular senescence.

**Immune system activation:** CDK4/6 inhibition may enhance immune recognition of cancer cells.

### 24.5.4 Clinical Applications

**Breast Cancer:** CDK4/6 inhibitors have transformed treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer:
- First-line therapy in combination with aromatase inhibitors
- Second-line therapy with fulvestrant
- Significant improvement in progression-free survival

**Other Cancers:** CDK4/6 inhibitors are being investigated in:
- Lung cancer
- Melanoma
- Sarcoma
- Glioblastoma

### 24.5.5 Resistance Mechanisms

**Rb pathway alterations:** Loss of Rb function or alterations in upstream regulators can confer resistance.

**Cyclin E amplification:** Overexpression of cyclin E can drive CDK2 activation independent of CDK4/6.

**Cell cycle checkpoint defects:** Alterations in cell cycle checkpoints may allow cells to bypass CDK4/6 inhibition.

## 24.6 Angiogenesis Inhibitors

### 24.6.1 Overview and Rationale

Angiogenesis—the formation of new blood vessels—is central to the growth of cancer. Tumor angiogenesis is required for tumors to grow beyond a few millimeters in size and for metastatic spread. An understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of tumor angiogenesis is therefore important for clinicians who diagnose and treat cancer.

During the prevascular phase, when angiogenic activity is absent or insufficient, tumors remain small, with volumes measured in a few cubic millimeters. When the prevascular phase of bladder cancer, cervical cancer, or cutaneous melanoma is first detected, these lesions may remain dormant for years before becoming vascularized.

### 24.6.2 VEGF Pathway Inhibitors

**Bevacizumab:** The prototype anti-angiogenic therapy. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). It blocks the interaction between VEGF-A and the VEGF receptors (VEGFR), primarily VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, on the surface of endothelial cells.

**Mechanism of Action:**
- Binding of VEGF-A to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 leads to endothelial cell proliferation
- Activation of survival pathways
- Formation of new blood vessels and angiogenesis
- Bevacizumab inhibits these processes

**Clinical Applications:**
- Colorectal cancer (first approval)
- Non-small cell lung cancer
- Glioblastoma
- Ovarian cancer
- Renal cell carcinoma

### 24.6.3 Small Molecule VEGFR Inhibitors

**Sunitinib:** A multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-KIT.

**Sorafenib:** Targets multiple kinases including VEGFR, PDGFR, and RAF kinases.

**Pazopanib:** A selective multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

### 24.6.4 Clinical Efficacy and Limitations

**Efficacy:** Angiogenesis inhibitors have shown significant clinical benefit:
- Improved progression-free survival in multiple cancer types
- Improved overall survival in some settings
- Combination with chemotherapy often superior to monotherapy

**Limitations:**
- Transient benefit in most patients
- Development of resistance
- Limited impact on overall survival in many cancers

### 24.6.5 Toxicity Profile

**Hypertension:** The overall incidence of significantly raised blood pressure was 8% among patients receiving bevacizumab, with a significantly increased risk compared to controls.

**Proteinuria:** Addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapeutic regimens significantly increased the risk of high-grade proteinuria in patients with cancer.

**Bleeding:** Increased risk of serious hemorrhage, particularly in squamous cell lung cancer.

**Thromboembolism:** The use of bevacizumab was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism in cancer patients.

**Other toxicities:**
- Wound healing complications
- Gastrointestinal perforation
- Congestive heart failure
- Ovarian failure in premenopausal women

## 24.7 Resistance Mechanisms to Targeted Therapies

### 24.7.1 Overview of Resistance

Resistance to targeted therapy and immunotherapy represents a significant challenge in cancer treatment. The mechanisms of resistance are multifactorial and include molecular target alterations and activation of alternative pathways, tumor heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment changes, immune evasion, and immunosuppression.

### 24.7.2 Intrinsic vs. Acquired Resistance

**Intrinsic Resistance:** Present before treatment initiation:
- Lack of target dependence
- Presence of resistance mutations
- Activation of compensatory pathways
- Tumor heterogeneity

**Acquired Resistance:** Develops during treatment:
- Secondary mutations in target genes
- Pathway reactivation
- Phenotypic switching
- Microenvironment changes

### 24.7.3 Molecular Mechanisms of Resistance

#### Target Alteration

**Kinase Domain Mutations:** Among CML patients who respond initially to imatinib, the disease recurs in a few percent each year. In virtually all of these leukemias that have acquired drug resistance, another mutation has occurred in the c-abl gene on the Philadelphia chromosome. These new mutations change the amino acid sequence of the abl fusion protein and prevent imatinib from inhibiting its tyrosine kinase activity.

**Gene Amplification:** Increased gene copy number can overcome drug inhibition.

**Alternative Splicing:** Cancer cells may produce splice variants that lack drug-binding domains.

#### Pathway Reactivation

**Feedback Loop Disruption:** Many targeted therapies disrupt negative feedback loops, leading to pathway reactivation.

**Upstream Activation:** Mutations or amplifications upstream of the target can reactivate the pathway.

**Downstream Bypass:** Activation of downstream effectors can bypass the targeted protein.

#### Alternative Pathway Activation

**Parallel Pathways:** Cancer cells may activate alternative pathways that perform similar functions.

**Metabolic Reprogramming:** Tumors may alter their metabolism to reduce dependence on the targeted pathway.

**Survival Signaling:** Activation of anti-apoptotic pathways can promote cell survival despite targeted therapy.

### 24.7.4 Tumor Microenvironment and Resistance

**Stromal Interactions:** Cancer-associated fibroblasts and other stromal cells can promote resistance through:
- Growth factor secretion

- Immunosuppressive factor secretion

**Angiogenic Adaptation:** Tumors may develop resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy through:
- Alternative angiogenic pathways
- Vessel co-option
- Increased invasiveness

### 24.7.5 Tumor Cell Plasticity

**Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT):** Tumor cells may undergo EMT, which confers:
- Increased invasiveness
- Resistance to apoptosis
- Stemness characteristics
- Drug resistance

**Cancer Stem Cells:** Small populations of cancer stem cells may be inherently resistant to targeted therapies and can repopulate tumors after treatment.

**Phenotypic Switching:** Tumors may undergo reversible phenotypic changes that confer resistance.

### 24.7.6 Pharmacokinetic Resistance

**Drug Efflux:** Increased expression of drug efflux pumps can reduce intracellular drug concentrations.
