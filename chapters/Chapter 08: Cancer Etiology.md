# Chapter 8: Cancer Etiology

## Introduction

Cancer is fundamentally characterized by continual unregulated proliferation of cancer cells. Rather than responding appropriately to the signals that control normal cell behavior, cancer cells grow and divide in an uncontrolled manner, invading normal tissues and organs and eventually spreading throughout the body. The development of cancer is now understood to be a complex multistep process involving the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations over time.

More than 90% of cancers are directly attributable to environmental and lifestyle factors, making them largely preventable. Understanding the etiology of cancer is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies and improving patient outcomes.

## 8.1 Chemical Carcinogens

### 8.1.1 Overview and Classification

Substances that cause cancer, called carcinogens, have been identified both by studies in experimental animals and by epidemiological analysis of cancer frequencies in human populations. Chemical carcinogens represent a diverse group of substances that can induce cancer through various mechanisms.

The level of risk associated with a carcinogenic agent depends on both the potency of the agent and the level of exposure to it. Carcinogenic potency can be estimated, fairly crudely, using clinical and epidemiologic data on humans or toxicologic data derived from animal cancer tests.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies carcinogens based on the strength of evidence:
- **Group 1**: Carcinogenic to humans
- **Group 2A**: Probably carcinogenic to humans  
- **Group 2B**: Possibly carcinogenic to humans
- **Group 3**: Not classifiable as to carcinogenicity
- **Group 4**: Probably not carcinogenic to humans

### 8.1.2 Mechanisms of Chemical Carcinogenesis

Carcinogenesis often appears to proceed by a multistep process, the first being an initiation event with subsequent promotional events that can often occur much later. This multistep process has been characterized through decades of research:

**Initiation, Promotion, and Progression**

In 1969, FOULDS had the intuition in the natural history of cancer of its stage evolution, and in 1982, BERENBLUM established three distinct stages: the initiation stage, the promotion stage and the progression stage.

1. **Initiation**: The induction of mutations in key target genes is thought to be the initial event leading to cancer development.

2. **Promotion**: Some substances known as tumor promoters, which are not themselves mutagenic, can cause cancer selectively in skin previously exposed to an initiator.

3. **Progression**: The transformation of initiated cells into fully malignant cancer cells.

**DNA Damage and Repair**

Radiation and many chemical carcinogens act by damaging DNA and inducing mutations. These enzymes normally help to convert ingested toxins into harmless and easily excreted compounds. Unfortunately, their activity on certain chemicals generates products that are highly mutagenic.

### 8.1.3 Major Classes of Chemical Carcinogens

**Tobacco Smoke Carcinogens**

Each puff of each cigarette contains a mixture of thousands of compounds, including more than 60 well-established carcinogens. The carcinogens in cigarette smoke belong to multiple chemical classes, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), N-nitrosamines, aromatic amines, aldehydes, volatile organic hydrocarbons, and metals.

The carcinogens in tobacco smoke (including benzo(a)pyrene, dimethylnitrosamine, and nickel compounds) are the major identified causes of human cancer. Smoking is the undisputed cause of 80 to 90% of lung cancers, as well as being implicated in cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and other sites.

**Aflatoxins**

The experiments performed on different animal species (fish, birds and mammals) have shown that AFB1 is carcinogenic. The carcinogenetic potential of aflatoxins has been determined to be in decreasing order: AFB1, AFG1, AFB2 and AFG2.

Cycasin (methylazoxymethanol-β-glucoside) is one of the most potent carcinogens found in plants. This compound and at least one related glucoside (macrozamin) are present in the palmlike cycad trees of the family Cycadaceae.

**N-Nitroso Compounds**

N-nitroso compounds have been detected in foods, in gastrointestinal contents, and in blood or urine, there has been much concern during the past 10 to 15 years about the role of N-nitroso compounds in the etiology of human cancer.

**Dietary Carcinogens**

Most solid tumours, irrespective of their organ site, evolve through a 15–25-year period of biological development before they become clinically apparent. Consumption of processed meat was recently classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), joining the individual dietary contaminants aflatoxin and aristolochic acid in that category.

### 8.1.4 Risk Assessment and Prevention

When inferences about human risks are based on laboratory studies using animals, several reasons for uncertainty exist: uncertainty about extrapolations from the high-dose levels used in the laboratory to the lower levels of exposure typical of the human diet; about the relative sensitivity of animals and humans to the effects of carcinogenic or anticarcinogenic agents.

Animals maintained on a calorie-restricted diet have shown significant reduction in the rate of onset of tumor formation and adverse toxicity to chemicals recognized to initiate cancer or cell death.

## 8.2 Radiation Carcinogenesis

### 8.2.1 Types of Radiation

Radiation encompasses electromagnetic waves and energetic particles that can interact with biological tissues in different ways. The carcinogenic risk associated with exposure to ionizing radiation has been evaluated previously in the IARC Monographs: radon in Volume 43, X-rays, γ-rays, and neutrons in Volume 75, and some internally deposited radionuclides in Volume 78.

**Ionizing Radiation**

All living matter is composed of atoms joined into molecules by electron bonds. Ionizing radiation is energetic enough to displace atomic electrons and thus break the bonds that hold a molecule together.

Ionizing radiation has been called a "universal carcinogen" in that it will induce cancer in most tissues of most species at all ages, including the fetus. It is one of the few definitely established carcinogens in human beings, and perhaps the only one for which firm dose-response data in human populations are available.

**Ultraviolet Radiation**

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is electromagnetic radiation found between X-radiation and light in the electromagnetic spectrum. UVR can be divided into ultraviolet A (UVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), and ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation components.

Solar UV radiation has beneficial biological effects, including enabling vitamin D synthesis, but its adverse effects include the induction of skin cancers.

### 8.2.2 Mechanisms of Radiation Carcinogenesis

**DNA Damage**

Carcinogenesis is viewed as a multistep process in which two or more intracellular events are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.

Ionizing radiation also produces a whole range of effects with potential implications for carcinogenesis. For example, the patterns of gene and protein expression are critical in determining cellular function and response.

Two molecular mechanisms are currently considered important in the initiation of carcinogenesis: activation of proto-oncogenes and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes. Both sites of action are vulnerable to the lethal and mutagenic effects of UVR.

**Genomic Instability**

In addition to being capable of producing mutations directly in the irradiated cell, ionizing radiation can also lead to genomic instability, resulting in the cell and its progeny having a reduced ability to replicate the genotype faithfully and therefore showing a permanently increased rate of acquisition of alterations in the genome.

### 8.2.3 Evidence from Human Studies

**Atomic Bomb Survivors**

The studies of atomic bomb survivors have provided crucial evidence for radiation carcinogenesis. It is, however, a relatively weak carcinogen and mutagen when compared with certain chemical agents. The cancers induced by radiation are of the same histologic types as occur naturally, but the distribution of types may differ.

**UV Radiation and Skin Cancer**

Skin cancers occur in uniquely accessible sites and are caused by well-defined environmental agents; consequently, their formation illustrates numerous salient features of carcinogenesis.

On the basis of a large body of evidence from human and experimental studies, the monograph concludes that solar radiation is carcinogenic to humans, causing cutaneous malignant melanoma and non-melanocytic skin cancer.

**Experimental Evidence**

The experimental induction of skin cancers in mice following exposure to a mercury-arc lamp was first reported by Findlay (1928). Initially, haired albino mice were used, but hairless and nude mice are now preferred.

Hundreds of studies have clearly established the carcinogenic activity of UVR in mice. The action spectrum for ultraviolet-induced skin carcinogenesis in albino hairless mice has been determined and shows a peak in the UVB range (280–315 nm) and a steep decrease in the UVA range (315–400 nm).

### 8.2.4 Dose-Response Relationships

It has been generally accepted that radiation carcinogenesis is a stochastic process; that is, the probability of the occurrence of the effect increases with dose with no threshold, but the severity of the effect is not influenced by dose.

The relative importance of the linear and quadratic terms varies widely for different cells and tissues. The ratio α/β, which is the dose at which the linear and quadratic contributions to the biological effect are equal, may vary from about 1 Gray (Gy) to more than 10 Gy.

## 8.3 Viral Carcinogenesis

### 8.3.1 Overview of Oncogenic Viruses

Approximately 12% of all human cancers have been attributed to viral infections. Although the known oncogenic viruses belong to different virus families, they often share several common traits, such as, viral cancers appear in the context of persistent infections, occur many years to decades after acute infection.

The IARC Monographs programme has classified 11 infectious agents, or groups of related agents, as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). These include one bacterium, seven viruses, and three macroparasites.

**Major Oncogenic Viruses**

The viruses are human papillomaviruses (HPVs), 13 subtypes of which are classified as carcinogenic, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and HIV-1.

### 8.3.2 Human Papillomaviruses (HPV)

**Virus Characteristics**

Papillomaviruses are small, non-enveloped, epitheliotropic, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect mucosal and cutaneous epithelia in a wide variety of higher vertebrates in a species-specific manner and induce cellular proliferation.

Unlike most other cancers, however, in which multiple environmental, biologic, and lifestyle determinants contribute independently or jointly to carcinogenesis, cervical cancer has been shown to have a central causal agent, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.

**Mechanisms of HPV Carcinogenesis**

Continuous expression of papillomavirus early genes may directly promote genetic abnormalities that often result in impaired function of genes that are critical for cell homeostasis. Furthermore, expression of high-risk HPV E6 and E7 genes in the basal cell layer induces chromosomal instability and aneuploidy.

Like E7, the E6 protein of HPV appears to contribute to cervical carcinogenesis through multiple activities. This protein is known to degrade p53 and other cellular targets through its interaction with the ubiquitin ligase E6AP.

**Clinical Significance**

To summarize, studies worldwide have consistently found HPV in 95 to 100 percent of cervical cancer cells, and in virtually all cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

Virtually all cases of cervical cancer are caused by persistent infection with certain oncogenic strains of HPV, a very common sexually transmitted virus.

### 8.3.3 Hepatitis Viruses

**Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)**

Biopsy material from patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma has been tested for the presence of HBV DNA. HBV DNA is integrated into the host genome, and isolation of restriction fragments larger than the HBV genome confirms HBV integration within the cell genome.

Globally, more than 260 million people are estimated to be chronic carriers of HBV, of whom 1–2% per year will progress to liver disease; more than 90% are unaware of their status.

**Prevention and Treatment**

Preventive vaccines against hepatitis B virus have been available since 1982, and direct-acting antiviral agents have the potential to cure more than 95% of people with hepatitis C virus infection.

### 8.3.4 Other Oncogenic Viruses

**Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)**

Volume 100 of the IARC Monographs identifies several human DNA and RNA viruses that are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1); these include various types of human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV-1.

**Immunosuppression and Viral Carcinogenesis**

Individuals who are latently infected with an oncogenic virus are at greatly increased risk for developing virus-related cancers when they become immunosuppressed.

The severe depletion of CD4-positive T lymphocytes induced by HIV-1 leads to dysregulated control of B lymphocytes and to the expression of co-infecting lymphotropic viruses.

## 8.4 Bacterial Carcinogenesis

### 8.4.1 Helicobacter pylori and Gastric Cancer

**Epidemiology and Disease Associations**

Helicobacter pylori (chronic infection) is known to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans.

Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been performed of the worldwide prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, the main (necessary but not sufficient) risk factor for gastric cancer. The global prevalence in adults is close to 50%, with large differences between continents and a trend towards a decrease over the years.

**Mechanisms of H. pylori Carcinogenesis**

Mechanistically, H. pylori might cause gastric carcinomas by the converging effects of two main types of events: (i) collateral damage of inflammatory by-products causing mutational events in gastric epithelial cells and (ii) direct effects on gastric epithelial cells by H. pylori organisms or released bacterial products.

H. pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis is a slow process, typically developing over 4–6 decades, and accompanied by specific histological changes. The 'intestinal' subtype of gastric adenocarcinoma develops through a preneoplastic sequence from chronic superficial gastritis through atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia.

**Inflammatory Response**

The intense gastric inflammatory infiltrate (gastritis) that accompanies gastric colonization by H. pylori in humans can generate potentially genotoxic reactive oxygen and nitrogen species from the inflammatory cells themselves, and from adjacent gastric epithelial cells.

H. pylori also initiates changes in the characteristics of stomach epithelial cells (known as the "epithelial to mesenchymal transition") that enable the cells to proliferate as cancer cells do.

**Virulence Factors**

Virulence factors in H. pylori strains vary geographically, which may help to explain geographical patterns of stomach cancer risk. As discussed above, cancer risks are higher for CagA-positive H. pylori infection than for CagA-negative infection.

These biological effects (chronic inflammation, changes in gene expression, mutations, genomic instability, and cellular proliferation) are associated with carcinogenesis. Some of these biological effects vary depending on virulence factors, the production of which can differ among H. pylori strains.

**Animal Models**

Recently, evidence that H. pylori infection may induce gastric adenocarcinomas in animal models has accumulated. Mongolian gerbils with long-term infection with H. pylori developed gastric cancer, with treatment with low-dose chemical carcinogens, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) or MNNG, or without them.

H. pylori infection (with bacteria orally administered by gavage) caused malignant tumors in two different types of stomach tissue in rodents, providing sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity.

### 8.4.2 Prevention and Treatment

**Eradication Therapy**

Randomized controlled trials (clinical studies with control groups that receive placebos) have shown that screening and treatment of H. pylori reduces stomach-cancer risk by approximately 35%.

In 16 intervention studies (non-controlled), eradication of H. pylori infection in gastric MALT lymphoma patients resulted in high rates (62% to 100%) of complete remission of the cancer.

**Risk Assessment**

In the pooled analysis, the risk of stomach cancer was highest in studies that followed the infected subjects for at least 10 years (in whom the risk was increased by a factor of nearly 6).

### 8.4.3 The Microbiome and Cancer

Helicobacter pylori is the best-understood model bacterium with a causal role in infection-related cancer, and the only one that has been classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) by the IARC Monographs.

Research on Helicobacter has unveiled many of the key molecular mechanisms by which bacteria persistently colonize host tissues and create a pro-oncogenic milieu. Many of these might be generalizable to other cancer-associated pathogens.

## 8.5 Multifactorial Nature of Carcinogenesis

### 8.5.1 The Hallmarks of Cancer

Currently, the most widely accepted theory is the multistep theory, which explains the genetic and epigenetic events involved in transforming a single cell into numerous malignant cells capable of metastasis. Moreover, identifying cancer hallmarks has redefined the understanding of carcinogenesis, providing a more comprehensive view of cancer as a process driven by the accumulation of these hallmarks.

Two enabling characteristics facilitate the acquisition of these traits: genomic instability and tumor-promoting inflammation. Additionally, deregulated tumor metabolism has emerged as a defining feature of cancer cells.

### 8.5.2 Co-factors and Risk Modifiers

**Hormones and Promotion**

Hormones, particularly estrogens, are important as tumor promoters in the development of some human cancers. The proliferation of cells of the uterine endometrium, for example, is stimulated by estrogen, and exposure to excess estrogen significantly increases the likelihood that a woman will develop endometrial cancer.

**Environmental Co-factors**

HPV infections are maintained significantly longer and are less likely to clear in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Both Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) and the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, two common STIs, both may enhance the oncogenic potential of HPV.

### 8.5.3 Prevention Strategies

**Primary Prevention**

The barriers to HPV vaccination are greatest in those countries with the weakest health systems and the highest burden of HPV-associated disease. To maintain HPV vaccination as a key element of cancer control programmes globally, and to introduce it in other settings, will require major international commitment and funding.

**Secondary Prevention**

Eradication of H. pylori has proven to be an effective strategy for the prevention of gastric cancer. However, studies of more complex microbial communities have had difficulties to precisely pinpoint cancer-associated bacterial strains and metabolic processes and to establish their carcinogenic effects.

## Conclusion

The etiology of cancer is complex and multifactorial, involving the interplay of chemical, physical, and biological agents with host factors. The development of a cancer generally requires many steps, each governed by multiple factors—some dependent on the genetic constitution of the individual, others dependent on his or her environment and way of life.

Understanding these mechanisms has led to significant advances in cancer prevention and treatment. The identification of specific carcinogens has enabled the development of targeted prevention strategies, from vaccination against oncogenic viruses to the elimination of chemical exposures. As our knowledge continues to expand, particularly in areas such as the microbiome and epigenetic modifications, new opportunities for cancer prevention and therapy will undoubtedly emerge.

The key to reducing the global burden of cancer lies in continued research into carcinogenic mechanisms, implementation of evidence-based prevention strategies, and addressing the social and environmental determinants that contribute to cancer risk disparities worldwide.
