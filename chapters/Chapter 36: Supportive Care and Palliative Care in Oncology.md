# Chapter 36: Supportive Care and Palliative Care in Oncology

Supportive care and palliative care are essential components of comprehensive cancer management that focus on optimizing quality of life and alleviating suffering throughout the entire disease trajectory. These approaches address the physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs of patients and their families, from diagnosis through survivorship or end-of-life care. This chapter examines the fundamental principles of supportive care, management of common cancer-related symptoms, nutritional considerations, psychological support, palliative care principles, and end-of-life care.

## 36.1 Management of Cancer-Related Symptoms

### Cancer Pain Management

Pain is one of the most common symptoms in cancer patients and often has a negative impact on patients' functional status and quality of life (QOL). The goal of pain management is to provide evidence-based, comprehensive care that addresses both physical pain and the emotional, social, and spiritual aspects of suffering.

#### WHO Analgesic Ladder

In 1986, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed the WHO analgesic ladder to provide adequate pain relief for cancer patients. The analgesic ladder was part of a vast health program termed the WHO Cancer Pain and Palliative Care Program, aimed at improving strategies for cancer pain management through educational campaigns, creating shared strategies, and developing a global network of support.

The three main principles of the WHO analgesic ladder are: "By the clock, by the mouth, by the ladder." This means that drugs should be taken regularly and at regular intervals, orally whenever possible, and analgesics should be prescribed starting at Step 1 (nonopioid analgesics) and titrated upward as needed.

**Step 1: Non-opioid analgesics**
- Acetaminophen
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketorolac)
- Adjuvant medications

**Step 2: Weak opioids**
- Codeine
- Tramadol
- Low-dose morphine

**Step 3: Strong opioids**
- Morphine
- Oxycodone
- Fentanyl
- Methadone

#### Opioid Management

Strong opioids, especially morphine, are the principal treatments for pain related to advanced and progressive disease, and their use has increased significantly in the primary care setting. However, the pharmacokinetics of the various opioids are very different and there are marked differences in bioavailability, metabolism and response among patients.

A suitable opioid must be selected for each patient and, because drug doses cannot be estimated or calculated in advance, the dose must be individually titrated. Effective and safe titration of opioids has a major impact on patient comfort.

**Methadone Considerations**
Given the complexities related to methadone administration, it is important that this opioid be prescribed by experienced clinicians who can provide careful monitoring. Methadone is both a mu-receptor agonist and an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. It can be given via multiple routes (oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, and rectal); has a long half-life (13 to 58 hours) and rapid onset of action; and is inexpensive, making it an attractive option for cancer pain control.

#### Pain Assessment and Monitoring

The clinical assessment of pain in medically ill patients is complex. Effective pain management requires close monitoring of patient response to initiation of treatment. In a review of 1,612 patients referred to an outpatient palliative care center where patients with advanced cancer were seen by both a palliative care nurse and a physician, more than half of patients with moderate to severe pain did not respond to an initial palliative care consultation.

#### Cultural Considerations in Pain Management

In a cross-sectional study, the cancer pain experience of White patients was individual and independent, while that of racial and ethnic minority patients was family oriented. Minority patients received support from their families during cancer treatment, and they fought cancer for their families. Other studies indicate that Asian patients have greater barriers to pain management and display more fatalism than Western patients.

#### Total Pain Concept

Saunders conceptualized the concept of "total pain" in evaluating and managing pain in the dying. The concept of total pain encompasses 4 components: the physical noxious stimuli, emotional discomfort, interpersonal conflicts, and the nonacceptance of one's death.

### Nausea and Vomiting Management

Prevention and control of nausea and vomiting (N&V) are paramount in the treatment of patients with cancer. Chemotherapy-induced N&V is one of the most common and distressing acute side effects of cancer treatment. It occurs in up to 80% of patients and can have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life.

#### Classification of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting

**Acute N&V**: Nausea and/or vomiting that occurs within 24 hours of chemotherapy administration.

**Delayed N&V**: Nausea and/or vomiting that occurs more than 24 hours after chemotherapy administration and may persist for several days.

**Anticipatory N&V (ANV)**: ANV is nausea and/or vomiting that occurs before a new cycle of chemotherapy is begun, in response to conditioned stimuli such as the smells, sights, and sounds of the treatment room. ANV is a classically conditioned response that typically occurs after three or four chemotherapy treatments after which the patient experienced acute or delayed N&V.

**Breakthrough N&V**: Vomiting that occurs within 5 days of prophylactic use of antiemetics and requires rescue.

**Refractory N&V**: N&V that does not respond to treatment.

#### Antiemetic Medications

**5-HT3 Receptor Antagonists**
Selective serotonin receptor (5-HT3) antagonists block serotonin, specifically targeting gastrointestinal (GI) vagal nerve terminals and the chemoreceptor trigger zone within the central nervous system:
- Ondansetron (Zofran)
- Granisetron (Kytril)
- Dolasetron (Anzemet)
- Palonosetron (Aloxi)

**NK-1 Receptor Antagonists**
Drugs that block the NK-1 receptor, a protein in the brain that can trigger nausea and vomiting:
- Aprepitant (Emend)
- Fosaprepitant

**Dopamine Receptor Antagonists**
Drugs that block dopamine, a chemical in the brain that can trigger nausea and vomiting:
- Metoclopramide (Reglan)
- Prochlorperazine (Compazine)
- Chlorpromazine

**Corticosteroids**
- Dexamethasone (Decadron)
- Methylprednisolone (Medrol)

#### Dexamethasone in Antiemetic Therapy

Dexamethasone alone or in combination with ondansetron has proven efficacy for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy. Studies have shown that following antiemetic protocols that include dexamethasone can improve patient outcomes and reduce the need for rescue medications.

#### Non-Pharmacological Approaches

**Acupressure**: Practitioners working with patients undergoing chemotherapy regularly encourage them to use acupressure in the form of Sea Bands for the relief of treatment-related nausea and vomiting. Results suggest that acupressure may decrease nausea among patients undergoing chemotherapy.

### Cancer-Related Fatigue

Cancer-related fatigue is one of the most prevalent and distressing symptoms experienced by cancer patients. Unlike normal fatigue, cancer-related fatigue is not relieved by rest and can significantly impact quality of life and functional status.

#### Pathophysiology

Cancer-related fatigue may result from:
- Direct effects of the tumor
- Cancer treatments (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery)
- Anemia
- Nutritional deficiencies
- Sleep disturbances
- Depression and anxiety
- Metabolic disorders
- Medications

#### Assessment and Management

Assessment should include evaluation of:
- Intensity and pattern of fatigue
- Impact on daily activities
- Contributing factors
- Associated symptoms

Management strategies include:
- Treatment of underlying causes (anemia, depression, sleep disorders)
- Exercise therapy (as appropriate)
- Energy conservation techniques
- Psychosocial interventions
- Pharmacological interventions when indicated

## 36.2 Nutritional Support

### Cancer-Associated Malnutrition

Malnutrition is a common problem in cancer patients that has been recognized as an important component of adverse outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality and decreased quality of life. Nutritional status can be compromised in direct response to tumor-induced alterations in metabolism.

#### Cancer Cachexia

Cancer cachexia is a wasting syndrome that leads to weakness, fatigue, and loss of skeletal muscle (also called sarcopenia) and fat. Unlike malnutrition, it cannot be reversed with nutrition support alone. Tumor-induced weight loss occurs frequently in patients with solid tumors of the lung, pancreas, and upper gastrointestinal tract and less often in patients with breast cancer or lower gastrointestinal cancer.

#### Assessment of Nutritional Status

Malnutrition and cachexia may be assessed simply in office practice by:
1. Measurement of weight loss as a percentage of the patient's usual body weight, accounting for edema, if any
2. Current weight as it compares to ideal body weight
3. A history of decreased appetite and/or decreased food intake

Anthropometric studies (weight, weight/height ratio, calf circumference, and mid-arm circumference) can be useful when performed serially by the same professional to assess the impact of nutritional intervention.

#### Nutritional Screening Tools

The simplified method called malnutrition screening test (MST), which is based on only two parameters, appetite and recent unintentional weight loss, is useful in the assessments of malnutrition in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.

### Treatment-Related Nutritional Issues

The most commonly experienced nutrition-related side effects are anorexia, taste changes, early satiety, nausea, vomiting, mucositis/esophagitis, diarrhea, and constipation. Because side effects of chemotherapy, as well as the cancer itself, can greatly affect nutritional status, healthcare providers need to anticipate possible problems and educate the patient about them in an effort to prevent malnutrition and weight loss.

#### Management Strategies

**Dietary Modifications**
- Small, frequent meals
- High-calorie, high-protein foods
- Foods that are easy to swallow and digest
- Attention to food preferences and cultural considerations

**Nutritional Supplements**
Nutritional support or high-calorie/high-protein liquid supplements may be used in an effort to maintain adequate calorie and nutrient intake. Examples include:
- Ensure
- Boost
- Specialized cancer nutrition products

**Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition**
For patients who continue to struggle to eat and keep up their weight, other nutrition support options may be discussed:
- Tube feeding (enteral nutrition) for patients with functional GI tract
- IV nutrition (parenteral nutrition) when the GI tract must be bypassed

### Nutrition in Advanced Cancer

Patients with advanced cancer can receive nutritional support even when nutrition therapy can do little for weight gain. Such support may help accomplish the following:
- Lessen side effects
- Reduce risk of infection (if given enterally)  
- Reduce asthenia
- Improve well-being

In individuals with advanced cancer, the goal of nutrition therapy should not be weight gain or reversal of malnutrition, but rather comfort and symptom relief.

## 36.3 Psychological and Social Support

### Psychosocial Needs of Cancer Patients

Cancer patients and their families face significant psychological and social challenges throughout the cancer journey. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) defines distress as an unpleasant experience of psychological, social, spiritual, and/or physical nature that may hinder the ability of patients to cope effectively with cancer or its treatment.

#### Prevalence and Impact

Distress is prevalent in approximately one-third of cancer survivors and can be associated with a reduced quality of life. Furthermore, patients experiencing distress have a lower likelihood of adhering to recommended health behaviors and surveillance strategies. Mood disorders, including anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder, are common manifestations of distress.

### Assessment of Psychological Distress

#### Screening Tools

The NCCN distress thermometer along with other tools such as PHQ9 can be easily administered prior to clinic visit such that the clinician and appropriate support staff (e.g., social worker or financial navigator) can be notified. Patients who display signs of anxiety, depression, or distress on initial screening should be thoroughly evaluated by the oncologist regarding any physical cause related to cancer or anticancer therapy.

#### Safety Evaluation

Safety evaluation, such as suicidal intent, safety at home, and social isolation, should be conducted by appropriate personnel. Access to licensed social workers experienced in caring for cancer patients or a dedicated psycho-oncologist is desirable for initial evaluation prior to referring selected patients to psychiatry.

### Interprofessional Psychosocial Support

#### Team Composition

A comprehensive psychosocial support team includes:
- Oncologists and primary care providers
- Licensed social workers
- Psychologists and psychiatrists with oncology expertise
- Chaplains and spiritual care providers
- Patient navigators
- Support group facilitators

#### Interventions

**Individual Counseling**
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy
- Supportive therapy
- Crisis intervention
- Medication management

**Group Support**
- Support groups for patients and families
- Educational groups
- Peer support programs

**Family Support**
- Family counseling
- Caregiver support programs
- Respite care services
- Bereavement support

### Special Populations

#### Older Adults
Although "health and well-being, social circumstances, living arrangements, and age-related changes resulting in diminished psychologic and physical functioning vary by individual and not by chronological age," older adults with cancer are more likely to present with a preexisting chronic disease and increased functional impairment and disability, which can compound the stresses imposed by cancer.

#### Children and Adolescents
The great cognitive, emotional, and developmental (as well as physical) variations among children affect the extent to which they can fully understand the implications of their disease and be involved in treatment decision making, how they cope with the physical pain and discomfort of treatment, and their need for psychosocial services.

## 36.4 Palliative Care Principles

### Definition and Goals

The World Health Organization characterizes the field of palliative care as a form of specialized medical care that aims to optimize the quality of life and alleviate the suffering of patients. One of the primary ways to achieve this is through early identification and treatment of new symptoms, along with managing those that prove refractory.

Palliative care addresses the physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs of patients with a serious illness, including but not limited to those with a life-limiting diagnosis, by employing an interprofessional team approach.

### Core Principles

Palliative care is characterized by the following features:
- It provides relief from pain and other distressing symptoms
- It affirms life and regards dying as a normal process
- It is intended neither to hasten nor to postpone death
- It integrates the physical, psychological and spiritual aspects of care
- It gives the patient and her family as much control and decision-making power as they desire and are able to accept
- It offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death

### Palliative Care vs. Hospice Care

Palliative care is often confused with hospice care. Palliative care is a larger umbrella that encompasses hospice care but is not limited to it. Palliative care works to enhance the quality of life and limit suffering in patients regardless of their goals of treatment, including working with patients seeking curative treatment.

Key differences:
- **Palliative Care**: Can be provided alongside curative treatment at any stage of serious illness
- **Hospice Care**: Focuses on comfort care for patients with a prognosis of 6 months or less who have chosen to forgo curative treatments

### Interdisciplinary Team Approach

A palliative team is comprised of a wide array of professionals, including:
- Palliative care physicians
- Specialty-trained nurses
- Social workers
- Chaplains
- Pharmacists
- Rehabilitation therapists
- Dietitians

### Symptom Management

Palliative care providers are adept at using a variety of pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical therapies to alleviate symptoms. These symptoms include pain, dyspnea, nausea, anxiety, depression, and fatigue.

Often anticipating and preventing symptoms before they occur is more effective than treating them after they occur. For example, prescribing the appropriate bowel regimen for patients at risk of developing constipation.

### Communication in Palliative Care

Palliative care providers are also communication specialists. Key communication strategies include:
- Breaking bad news sensitively
- Discussing prognosis and goals of care
- Facilitating family conferences
- Supporting decision-making
- Planning transitions in care

#### Breaking Bad News

When delivering difficult news:
- Prepare the setting and ensure privacy
- Assess what the patient/family already knows
- Ask permission before sharing information
- Provide information clearly and compassionately
- Respond to emotions with empathy
- Set up a clear plan for communication and follow-up
- Avoid statements that imply abandonment

### Early Integration of Palliative Care

Early utilization of palliative care has been correlated with improved survival in patients with metastatic cancer, reduced cost of care, and improved quality of life. Studies have shown that using palliative care teams can decrease overall healthcare costs, including improved intensive care unit utilization, decreased emergency department utilization, and reduced inpatient readmission rates.

## 36.5 End-of-Life Care

### Defining End-of-Life Care

For most people, death does not come suddenly. Instead, dying is an inevitable result of one or more diseases that must be managed carefully and compassionately over weeks, months, or even years, through many ups and downs. Evidence shows that—regardless of whether curative treatments are also undertaken—a palliative approach often offers the best chance of maintaining the highest possible quality of life for the longest possible time for those living with advanced serious illness.

### Hospice Care

#### Definition and Philosophy

The underlying premise behind hospice care is to focus on the quality of care to patients who present with a life-limiting illness who are not expected to live more than six months instead of seeking treatment to prolong the condition or seek a medical cure. Hospice focuses on the entire person and supports the family by combining all elements of physical, psychological, and spiritual needs.

#### Eligibility Criteria

For Medicare hospice benefits, patients must meet the following criteria:
- Over 65 years of age or eligible for Medicare services due to long-term disability for greater than two years or having end-stage kidney disease
- Certification by Medicare as a recognized hospice facility
- Patient verification choosing hospice services instead of utilizing regular Medicare coverage
- Certification from both a physician and hospice medical director verifying the patient has received a diagnosis of a terminal illness, and in typical circumstances, without treatment to prolong the patient's disease, they are expected not to live more than six months

#### Hospice Services

When a patient has a terminal condition, Medicare will provide hospice care, including comprehensive services related to a terminal illness. The array of benefits may include:
- Physician and nursing services
- Medical equipment and supplies
- Medications for symptom control
- Physical, occupational, and speech therapy
- Social worker services
- Spiritual care
- Short-term respite care
- Bereavement support for families

### Signs and Symptoms in the Final Days

Healthcare providers can give family members information about the changes they may see in their loved one in the final hours and how they may help their loved one through this. Common signs and symptoms include:

#### Physical Changes
- Feeling very tired
- Shortness of breath
- Constipation
- Trouble swallowing
- Rattle sound with breathing
- Myoclonic jerks
- Hemorrhage

#### Neurological Changes
- Delirium is common during the final days of life
- Most patients have a lower level of consciousness
- They may be withdrawn, be less alert, and have less energy
- Some patients may be agitated or restless, and have hallucinations

### Family Support and Bereavement

#### Supporting Families

Families need information and support during the end-of-life period:
- Education about what to expect
- Emotional support and counseling
- Practical assistance with care
- Respite care services
- Spiritual support

#### Bereavement Support

Support for caregivers continues after the patient's death:
- Grief counseling
- Support groups
- Memorial services
- Follow-up contact and assessment
- Referral to community resources

### Barriers to End-of-Life Care

In 2017 Hospice UK estimated that one in four people, approximately 118,000, who require end-of-life care and their families are not able to access the expert care they need at the end of life. This is particularly true for people with conditions other than cancer, and people from economically and socially deprived areas, BAME communities and LGBT people can experience barriers to accessing end-of-life care services.

#### Common Barriers
- Poor communication and coordination of services
- Professionals' difficulty recognizing when someone has entered the last year of life
- Lack of skills to discuss end-of-life issues with openness and sensitivity
- Limited availability of services
- Cultural and language barriers
- Financial constraints

### Spiritual Care at End of Life

Serious illnesses like cancer may cause patients or family caregivers to have doubts about their beliefs or religious values and cause spiritual distress. Some studies show that patients with cancer may feel anger at God or may have a loss of faith after being diagnosed.

Spiritual distress may affect end-of-life decisions and increase depression. Doctors and nurses, together with social workers and psychologists, may be able to offer care that supports a patient's spiritual health. When patients with advanced cancer receive spiritual support from the medical team, they are more likely to choose hospice care and less aggressive treatment at the end of life.

### Advance Care Planning

Advance care planning involves discussions about:
- Values and goals for end-of-life care
- Preferences for life-sustaining treatments
- Designation of healthcare proxies
- Completion of advance directives
- Documentation of care preferences

### Quality of Death

In their efforts to define the concept of a "Good Death," researchers narrowed it down to 36 studies that addressed the parameters for good death defined by patients at the end of their life. Pain-free status was 1 of the top 3 priorities noted, with 81% of the studies significantly weighing on its importance.

Elements of a good death include:
- Adequate pain and symptom management
- Clear decision-making
- Preparation and closure
- Affirmation of the whole person
- Strengthening relationships
- Coming to terms with reality
- Receiving adequate medical care
- Being treated with dignity and respect

## Conclusion

Supportive care and palliative care are integral components of comprehensive cancer care that address the multidimensional needs of patients and families throughout the disease trajectory. Effective symptom management, including pain control, nausea prevention, and fatigue management, significantly impacts quality of life and treatment outcomes. Nutritional support plays a crucial role in maintaining strength and optimizing treatment tolerance, while psychological and social support services address the emotional and practical challenges of cancer.

The principles of palliative care—focusing on comfort, dignity, and quality of life—can be applied from diagnosis through survivorship or end-of-life care. Early integration of palliative care services has been shown to improve patient outcomes, enhance quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs. End-of-life care, including hospice services, provides compassionate support for patients and families during the final phase of life.

Healthcare providers must develop competencies in these areas to provide truly comprehensive cancer care. This includes skills in symptom assessment and management, communication of difficult information, coordination of interdisciplinary care, and support for patients and families facing the challenges of serious illness. By integrating supportive and palliative care principles throughout the cancer care continuum, healthcare teams can help patients and families navigate the complexities of cancer while maintaining dignity, comfort, and the highest possible quality of life.
