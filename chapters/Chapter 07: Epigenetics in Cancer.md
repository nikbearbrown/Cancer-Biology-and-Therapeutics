# Chapter 7: Epigenetics in Cancer

## 7.1 Introduction to Epigenetics in Cancer

### 7.1.1 Definition and Scope

Epigenetics is the study of heritable and stable changes in gene expression that occur through alterations in the chromosome rather than in the DNA sequence. Despite not directly altering the DNA sequence, epigenetic mechanisms can regulate gene expression through chemical modifications of DNA bases and changes to the chromosomal superstructure in which DNA is packaged.

The past decade has seen a remarkable acceleration in the validation of the concept that cancer is not only a genetic disease but also one of epigenetic abnormalities. This view has been significantly strengthened by whole-genome sequencing results showing that numerous epigenetic regulators are frequently the target of mutations and epimutations in cancer cells, with an intriguing interplay between the two.

### 7.1.2 Fundamental Epigenetic Mechanisms

Three different epigenetic mechanisms have been identified that play crucial roles in cancer development:

1. **DNA methylation**: Involves the addition of a methyl group directly to a cytosine nucleotide
2. **Histone modifications**: Chemical changes to histone proteins that package DNA
3. **Non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing**: Regulation through RNA molecules that do not code for proteins

These mechanisms form a layer of control within a cell that regulates gene expression and silencing. This control varies between tissues and plays an important role in cell differentiation. Additionally, differences in gene expression between cells, which are driven by epigenetic modifications, result in the unique function of specific cell types.

### 7.1.3 Epigenetic Alterations in Cancer

In cancer, the normal epigenetic patterns are disrupted resulting in the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes like CDKN2A. The abundance of cancer mutations involving epigenetic regulator genes practically affects all levels of epigenetic regulation, including key players in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin organization but also substrates for these modifications, such as histones.

Alterations in chromatin function and epigenetic mechanisms are a hallmark of cancer. The disruption of epigenetic processes has been linked to altered gene expression and to cancer initiation and progression.

## 7.2 DNA Methylation in Cancer

### 7.2.1 Molecular Basis of DNA Methylation

DNA methylation provides a stable gene silencing mechanism that plays an important role in regulating gene expression and chromatin architecture in association with histone modifications and other chromatin associated proteins. The mechanism is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes.

During cell division, genome-wide patterns of DNA and histone modifications are established during early development and are maintained throughout multiple cell divisions. The cytosine base of DNA in animal and plant genomes can be chemically modified to 5-methyl-cytosine (5mC).

### 7.2.2 DNA Methylation Alterations in Cancer

Aberrant DNA methylation was the first epigenetic abnormality to be identified in human cancers. Alterations detected in cancers include:

1. **Promoter hypermethylation**: The consequent silencing of tumor suppressor genes
2. **Global hypomethylation**: Associated with genomic instability
3. **Alterations of DNA methylation at imprinting control regions**: With consequent loss of imprinting

**Genomic Hypomethylation**

Genomic hypomethylation contributes to genetic instability and proto-oncogene hypomethylation, which is responsible for their stronger expression. This general decline in the level of methylated cytosine is accompanied by local locus-specific hypermethylation.

**Promoter Hypermethylation**

Functional silencing of tumor-associated genes is usually associated with local promoter hypermethylation. Regions of low-density methylation near CpG islands, known as 'shores', exhibit great variation in DNA methylation, including hypomethylation and hypermethylation, across different types of cancers.

### 7.2.3 Clinical Examples

Promoter hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene have been widely described in glioma. Epigenetic silencing of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene by promoter methylation has been associated with better response to temozolomide (an alkylating agent) because the MGMT gene encodes a DNA-repair protein that removes alkyl groups from the O6 position of guanine.

## 7.3 Histone Modifications in Cancer

### 7.3.1 Basic Mechanisms of Histone Modifications

Negatively charged DNA is packaged around a positively charged histone protein octamer, which contains 2 copies of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. This nucleoprotein complex is a nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin. The nucleosomes of a continuous DNA polymer are connected by linker DNA and the complex is stabilized by histone protein H1.

N-terminal tails of core histone protein (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) are largely targeted for the posttranscriptional modifications (PTMs), such as methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation. Modifications in histone tails affect the chromatin structure which is critical for the gene regulation.

### 7.3.2 Types of Histone Modifications

The histone modifications include:

- **Arginine and lysine acetylation and methylation**
- **Serine phosphorylation**
- **Lysine ubiquitination**

All these changes are performed by enzymes such as:
- Histone acetyl-transferases (HATs)
- Histone methyl-transferases (HMTs)
- Histone deacetylases (HDACs)
- Histone demethylases (HDMs)

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone demethylases (HDMs, or KDMs for lysine demethylases) remove acetyl- and methyl-groups from lysines, respectively. In addition, deubiquitinating enzymes contribute to the turnover of ubiquitin moieties.

### 7.3.3 Histone Modifications in Cancer

Chromatin structure is highly dynamic, and orchestrated by chromatin remodeling complexes, and histone modifying enzymes. Aberrations in histone modification caused by defects in activity of histone modifying enzymes and chromatin remodeling complexes may contribute to the neoplastic transformation.

Mutations in histone genes or chromatin modifier proteins are frequently detected in many cancer types, resulting in impairments in gene expression programs and genomic integrity. During the tumorigenesis, DNA methylation in promoter regions is induced, while genome-wide DNA methylation is downregulated.

**Clinical Examples in Bladder Cancer**

Chromatin deregulation is an emerging theme in cancer pathogenesis, and bladder cancer stands out among many other cancer types with frequent mutations of genes involved in epigenetic regulation. The most common mutations in bladder cancer occur in genes functioning in histone modification and chromatin remodeling genes. These include ARID1A (25%), KDM6A (24%), KMT2D (27%), EP300 (15%). Globally, almost 80% of all bladder cancer patients have mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation, demonstrating the high degree of epigenetic dysregulation in this cancer.

### 7.3.4 Metabolic Regulation of Histone Modifications

Most chromatin-modifying enzymes use metabolites as cofactors. Consequently, the cellular metabolism can influence the capacity of the cell to write or erase chromatin marks. This points to an intimate relationship between metabolic and epigenetic regulation.

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the cofactor of DNA and histone methyltransferases and is the second most common enzymatic cofactor after ATP. SAM plays major roles in epigenetics, biosynthetic processes including phosphatidylcholine, creatine, and polyamine synthesis, as well as sulfur metabolism.

## 7.4 Non-coding RNAs in Cancer

### 7.4.1 Overview of Non-coding RNAs

A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule that is transcribed but not translated into proteins. Once regarded as waste of the genome, recent insight suggests the ncRNA molecules harbor a crucial role in epigenetic gene expression and likely account for the great difference in phenotype between species and within human populations despite such similarity in encoded proteins.

Notable ncRNA molecules include:
- **MicroRNAs (miRNA) and short interfering RNAs (siRNA)**: Which include less than 30 nucleotides
- **Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA)**: Which are 200 nucleotides or longer

Though the full extent of their role in epigenetics is still being determined, there is evidence suggesting that ncRNAs participate in DNA methylation and histone modifications in addition to gene silencing. siRNAs and lncRNAs both have been shown to regulate gene expression by the formation of heterochromatin.

### 7.4.2 MicroRNAs in Cancer

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. They are linked to many developmental and pathological states including wound healing, cancer invasion, and metastasis, the primary cause of cancer-related death.

**Structure and Biogenesis**

MicroRNA is a class of abundant, genetically robust, non-coding, 18-25 nucleotide (nt), single-stranded oligoribonucleotides found in animals, plants, green algae, and viruses. MicroRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by targeting specific messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts for translational inhibition or degradation.

**Canonical Biogenesis Pathway**

MicroRNAs are transcribed on long primary transcripts (pri-miRNA) then cleaved by Drosha to form a 60-80 nt pre-miRNA, which is exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 and Ran-GTP. The pre-miRNA is cleaved by Dicer. Argonaute (Ago) proteins incorporate the duplex and separate the two strands. The miRNA-Ago association forms the core of the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC), which assists in the annealing of the miRNA to its target mRNA.

**Clinical Applications**

miRNAs are critical regulators of gene expression, and consequently, the defective miRNA biogenesis observed in cancer makes a crucial contribution to cancer development. Large cohort studies have identified miRNAs that are differentially expressed between normal colon and tumor epithelium, and further indicate that miRNA profiles might be able to differentiate between cancer subtypes.

**miRNA-21 as a Biomarker**

Several studies utilizing microRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) have been reported. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio and diagnostic odd ratio of microRNAs for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer were 0.81, 0.78, 4.14, 0.24, and 19.2, respectively. miR-21 is a promising biomarker for early detection and prognosis of colorectal cancer.

### 7.4.3 Long Non-coding RNAs in Cancer

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) range in size from 200 to several thousand nucleotides and mediate critical cellular functions, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, subcellular trafficking and organelle biogenesis. It is therefore not surprising that recent studies have implicated their aberrant expression in behaviors that contribute to disease, including metastasis.

**Historical Context**

Empirical evidence of 'unique' heterogeneous nuclear-confined RNA (hnRNA) has been known for over 40 years. The nature of some hnRNA unique to the nucleus could be explained by the ensuing discovery that genes were mosaics comprised of protein-coding regions interspersed with non-coding 'silent' regions, termed 'exons' and 'introns', respectively.

**Clinical Significance**

The first human long non-coding RNA to be causally linked to cancer was the maternally expressed H19 gene. The 2.3kb imprinted H19 transcript has been linked to several human malignancies, including breast cancer. Although some studies have assigned a tumor suppressor role to H19, the overwhelming evidence is consistent with promotion of malignancy.

## 7.5 Polycomb and Trithorax Group Proteins

### 7.5.1 Cellular Memory Systems

The identity of cells in an organism is largely defined by their specific transcriptional profile. During cell division, these profiles need to be faithfully inherited to the daughter cells to ensure the maintenance of cell structure and function in a cell lineage. Two groups of chromatin regulators, the Polycomb group (PcG) and the Trithorax group (TrxG), act in an antagonistic manner to maintain differential gene expression states.

Members of the PcG cooperate in large multiprotein complexes to modify histones with repressive marks, resulting in condensed chromatin domains. Conversely, the TrxG proteins counteract the repressed domains by opening nucleosomal structures and establishing activating histone modifications.

### 7.5.2 Clinical Relevance in Cancer

The human TrxG gene Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL1) was initially identified as a chromosomal translocation found in blood cells and causing acute lymphoblastic or myeloid leukemia. MLL1 codes, as its Drosophila ortholog trithorax (trx), for a histone 3 lysine 4 methyltransferase (KMT), catalyzing the addition of the positive histone mark H3K4me3.

A major hallmark of PcG silencing is the H3K27me3 histone modification observed primarily at repressive elements and connected promoters but also extending largely over the body of the repressed gene.

### 7.5.3 Bivalent Chromatin and Cancer

With ongoing developmental time and programming, the signals are resolved into either a complete H3K27me3 pattern (and/or in the case of mammals with additional DNA methylation signals) when the gene is repressed or a complete H3K4me3 (and accompanying H3/H4 acetylation) when the gene is active. This site-specific anti-repressor capability of members of the TrxG provides a means for how localized competition can switch the expression state from silenced to activated, also known as the "bivalent master switch" model.

## 7.6 Epigenetic Reprogramming in Cancer

### 7.6.1 Cancer as Epigenetic Disease

With accumulating mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, the cells lose their contacts with the neighbors, start to over-proliferate, change metabolic behavior, and eventually migrate to create the deadly metastases. Cancer is also a disease of transcriptional mis-regulation and, given the role of chromatin in this process, it is not surprising to realize that many mutations in chromatin-controlling factors have been observed in human cancers.

Mutations ensure the long-term phenotypic change of cancer cells. However, epigenetic marks like DNA methylation or histone modifications can also contribute to these changes, and importantly, these epigenetic alterations may be reversible.

### 7.6.2 Epigenetic Changes in Carcinogenesis

Recent research suggests that cell initiation may result from epigenetic changes rather than genetic mutations. Environmental factors, such as exposure to non-mutagenic carcinogens, can trigger these epigenetic events. These modifications may serve as the initial alteration in cell properties, potentially leading to the development of the first hallmark of cancer.

Alternatively, these epigenetic changes may prime cells to respond more readily to a subsequent genetic mutation. Conversely, an epigenetic mutation may arise from a mutation in genes that regulate epigenetic processes, such as DNA methyltransferase genes DNMT1 and DNMT3A.

### 7.6.3 Stem Cells and Epigenetic Cancer

There is a growing body of data suggesting that cancer "stem/initiating cells", especially when they may dominate in the most aggressive forms of human tumors, have a gene expression signature reminiscent of embryonic stem (ES) cells. A key part of this signature is an increase in polycomb protein group (PcG) complex constituents, and a decrease in expression of a group of genes for which PcG targeting is normally key to maintaining a poised, low basal activity.

## 7.7 Epigenetic Therapy

### 7.7.1 Therapeutic Rationale

The reversible nature of epigenetic aberrations has led to the emergence of the promising field of epigenetic therapy that has already provided new therapeutic options for patients with malignancies characterized by epigenetic alterations, laying the basis for new and personalized medicine.

The most promising way to treat diseases through epigenetic regulation has been through pharmacology. Previous clinical trials for drugs formulated to block epigenetic modifications associated with cancers have proved successful.

### 7.7.2 FDA-Approved Epigenetic Drugs

The FDA has approved a number of these drugs which target epigenetic regulators to treat various cancers including:

- **Azacytidine and decitabine** for myelodysplastic syndrome
- **Panobinostat** for multiple myeloma
- **Romidepsin** for cutaneous T cell lymphoma

More drugs are likely to be approved in the coming years as a number of clinical trials for DNA methylation inhibitors and histone modification inhibitors are underway.

### 7.7.3 DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors

Azacitidine and decitabine are nucleotide analogues that are used as inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases. These nucleotide analogues can be incorporated during DNA replication instead of cytosine and covalently bind DNMT1, impairing the inheritance of DNA methylation during DNA replication.

It is important to note that, in addition to the demethylating effect of these compounds, also the trapping of DNMT proteins on the DNA might indirectly contribute to an anti-cancer effect. Recently, it has also been shown that treatment with DNMT inhibitors induces immune signaling in cancer cells through the upregulation of a wide range of genes implicated in immune signaling and increased numbers of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.

### 7.7.4 Combination Therapies

Transcriptional silencing mediated by DNA methylation is also related to the recruitment of co-repressors and deacetylation or methylation of histone marks at promoters and enhancers. Accordingly, the combinatorial use of DNMT and histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors was shown to enhance reactivation of aberrantly silenced genes in tumor cells and cause reductions in tumor burden.

### 7.7.5 Synthetic Lethality Approaches

Some cancer cells are "addicted" to a particular DNA damage response (DDR) pathway to partially maintain the genomic stability if the primary DDR pathway is already inactivated by genetic or epigenetic changes. By targeting the salvage DDR pathway, cancer cell killing can be achieved through a mechanism known as synthetic lethality.

So far, only PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have been approved for metastatic cancer management. PARP inhibitors are currently used in the management of tumors with absent or dysfunctional BRCA genes such as breast and ovarian cancers.

## 7.8 Clinical Applications and Future Directions

### 7.8.1 Biomarker Applications

Recent cancer genome sequencing projects have revealed that numerous epigenetic regulators are frequently mutated in various cancers. This information has not only started to be utilized as prognostic and predictive markers to guide treatment decisions but also provided important information for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in both physiological and pathological conditions.

### 7.8.2 Personalized Medicine

The identification of mutations in writers, readers, and erasers, as well as alterations in the epigenetic landscape in cancers, do not only imply a causative role for these factors in cancer initiation and progression but also provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

### 7.8.3 Future Research Directions

Studies of intragenic and distant intergenic alterations in DNA methylation will help elucidate the nature of epigenetic deregulation in diseases, especially for cancer. The epigenetic signatures of various cancers can be targeted via epigenetic drugs or other genome editing tools, ultimately bringing specific treatment options for different cancer types.

## Conclusion
