# Chapter 29: Future Directions in Cancer Treatment Research

The landscape of cancer research continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, driven by technological advances, deepening understanding of cancer biology, and the urgent need to improve patient outcomes. This chapter explores seven key areas that represent the future of cancer treatment research, each offering unique opportunities to revolutionize how we detect, monitor, and treat cancer.

## 29.1 Liquid Biopsies and Circulating Tumor DNA for Monitoring and Early Detection

### 29.1.1 Foundations and Definition

Liquid biopsy, the sampling of cellular material from a solid tumor that has actively or passively entered the bloodstream, is an exciting area of research in cancer diagnostics. Tumor-derived components amenable to liquid biopsy include circulating tumor cells, exosomes, and circulating nucleic acids such as cell-free DNA and noncoding RNA. The term "cell-free DNA (cfDNA)" refers to fragmented DNA (genetic material) found outside cells in the blood and was first reported by Mandel and Metais in 1948.

**Core Components of Liquid Biopsy:**
- **Circulating tumor cells (CTCs)**: Cells shed from primary and metastatic sites of solid tumors into the bloodstream
- **Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)**: DNA fragments released from tumor cells during apoptosis or necrosis
- **Cell-free RNA (cfRNA)**: RNA molecules circulating in blood plasma
- **Exosomes**: Extracellular vesicles containing genetic material
- **Tumor-educated platelets**: Platelets that have been influenced by tumor cells

### 29.1.2 Technical Approaches and Methodologies

**ctDNA Detection and Analysis:**
Compared to the isolation of circulating tumor cells, isolation of ctDNA is straightforward. Five to twenty milliliters of peripheral blood is drawn in a collection tube containing anticoagulant and preservatives. Cells are removed by centrifugation leaving plasma from which cfDNA can then be extracted using commercially available kits. cfDNA is generally procured from plasma rather than serum, due to the risk of increased non-tumor cfDNA from cell lysis when serum separator tubes are used.

**Technical Challenges:**
Distinguishing ctDNA from non-tumor cfDNA is a major challenge in liquid biopsy research, analogous to the "needle-in-a-haystack" problem of identifying CTCs among blood cells. Success depends on the sensitivity of the method employed for DNA analysis. While traditional RT-PCR has been used to identify point mutations, newer higher sensitivity methods with the potential for absolute quantification include digital PCR in which samples are diluted to one template per PCR reaction.

### 29.1.3 Clinical Applications Across Cancer Types

**Hepatocellular Carcinoma:**
The qualitative and quantitative analysis of these biomarkers holds promise for improving the clinical care of individuals with HCC. In particular, research has focused on the role of liquid biopsy in the detection of HCC at an early and curable stage, given the major clinical need for biomarkers for this purpose. However, commonly used surveillance tools including serum AFP and liver ultrasonography are suboptimal, suffering from low sensitivity for early lesions.

**Uveal Melanoma:**
The detection and characterization of circulating melanoma cells (CMCs) can aid in the diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring of UM patients. Furthermore, CMCs provide additional information that cannot be acquired by studying the primary tumor alone. CMCs can be characterized for the presence of key prognostic factors, such as monosomy-3, and used as a prognostic tool particularly in patients undergoing eye-preserving therapy and where no tumor biopsy is collected.

### 29.1.4 Monitoring Treatment Response and Disease Progression

**Real-time Disease Monitoring:**
For diagnosed early-stage cancer, liquid biopsy could play a role in risk stratification and detection of recurrence after treatment. In the setting of metastatic cancer, liquid biopsy could aid in treatment selection, monitoring of response, and understanding mechanisms of resistance. Each cellular component targeted by liquid biopsy has both strengths and weaknesses in addressing these clinical needs.

**Prognostic Significance:**
Their presence correlates with an unfavorable prognosis and a reduced progression-free interval, and various studies have shown that the monitoring of CTC allows for the evaluation of treatment efficacy in different tumors. It is assumed that the CTCs are predecessors of a metastatic settlement and thus the main element of the metastatic process itself.

### 29.1.5 Current Limitations and Future Directions

**Technical Challenges:**
Despite these potential benefits for cancer care and cancer patients, the implementation of liquid biopsies has a number of considerations and hurdles to overcome, such as the need for further validation, increases in sensitivity and specificity, and the rare nature of cancer mutations. Although liquid biopsy has increasingly been adopted and explored for clinical care, careful analytic and clinical validation, and additional preclinical studies addressing the biology of liquid biopsy analytes are needed.

**Clinical Translation:**
Circulating tumour DNA can be measured across various scales ranging from single mutations to the analysis of the whole genome. Targeting a known tumour mutation has shown to have greater sensitivity (a test that correctly identifies patients with the disease), whereas applying a broader genome approach can be less sensitive. The type of method utilized can present different challenges when attempting to use it for purposes of screening or diagnosis.

## 29.2 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Oncology

### 29.2.1 Historical Context and Current Landscape

**Evolution of AI in Healthcare:**
The field of machine learning applies the scientific method to representing, understanding, and utilizing datasets, and, as a result, practitioners are known as data scientists. Around 2010, AI began its resurgence to prominence due to the success of machine learning and data science techniques as well as significant increases in computational storage and power.

**Growth in Medical Literature:**
Figure 2 illustrates the explosive growth of ML and AI through the number of Pubmed publications over the years between 1990 and 2022. The rate of growth in AI and ML far outpaces the overall growth rate of publications since 2015. In health AI, machine Learning enjoys most of the growth, with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image Analysis following closely.

### 29.2.2 Applications in Cancer Research

**Drug Discovery and Development:**
The big data revolution, accompanied by the development and deployment of wearable medical devices and mobile health applications, has enabled the biomedical community to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to vast amounts of data. This shift has created new research opportunities in predictive analytics, precision medicine, virtual diagnosis, patient monitoring, and drug discovery and delivery.

**Genomic Analysis:**
One noteworthy DARPA project is called Big Mechanism, which is developing an AI system that can read research on cell biology, extract enough information out of it to construct a candidate model of cancer pathways in the cell, interact with a human biologist to try to refine the model, and develop a hypothesis and a causal model of what is happening.

### 29.2.3 Clinical Decision Support Systems

**Diagnostic Applications:**
Many AI technologies can be applied to different aspects of science, such as AI-guided sensors, natural language techniques to process scientific literature, and computer vision for analyzing medical images. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care offers unprecedented opportunities to improve patient and clinical team outcomes, reduce costs, and impact population health.

**Treatment Planning:**
Programming AI and machine learning is still 99 percent human work. The equation for AI success is to take a set of categories (for example, cats and dogs) and an enormous amount of data (that is labeled as to whether it is a cat or a dog), and then feed those two inputs through an algorithm.

### 29.2.4 Challenges and Limitations

**Data Quality and Bias:**
How vulnerable are algorithms to bias and unfairness? How can research improve the process of detecting unfairness in machine learning algorithms? These questions require interdisciplinary discussion and collaboration.

**Validation and Regulatory Considerations:**
Well-constructed ML models do have general applicability beyond the training data, otherwise they would be just a catalogue of past problem instances and their solutions, without the ability to be used for new problem instances. Machine Learning theory provides results and techniques that enable and ideally guarantee the generalization properties of ML models beyond the training data.

### 29.2.5 Future Directions and Integration

**Collaborative AI Systems:**
In time, it would be very important to reach a point where an AI model has developed an understanding of a phenomenon and can explain it to human scientists. There is great potential in AI being used to create and work with digital twins in studying such things as the human body.

**Personalized Medicine:**
AI could play a role in helping scientists do their jobs betterâ€”report their findings better, put them in context better, verify them better, and so on. The goal is to create experiences that feel premium and cutting-edge while maintaining scientific rigor.

## 29.3 Organoids and Patient-Derived Xenografts for Drug Testing

### 29.3.1 Patient-Derived Xenograft Models

**Definition and Advantages:**
Patient-derived xenografts (PDX), a recent focus of glioblastoma research, are used extensively in translational research. The PDX model has the advantage of retaining both the genetic and histological features of the primary tumor from which it was derived. Because the tumors are propagated in successive generations of mice, PDX cells are not subjected to stresses that can arise in cell cultures.

**Model Development:**
PDX models are generally established by injecting glioblastoma tumor spheres produced under serum-free neurosphere-culture conditions, into immunodeficient mice. Another method for establishing PDX models is to inject tissues from fresh brain-tumor biopsies into immunodeficient mice. The biopsy tissue is generally minced with surgical blades and placed in flasks containing standard serum-supplemented tissue-culture medium.

### 29.3.2 Advantages of PDX Models Over Traditional Cell Lines

**Genetic Fidelity:**
Patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models are created from direct implantation of either biopsied tumor fragments or freshly isolated cells without the need for intermediate cell culture. These models retain the genetic, histological, and molecular profile similar to the primary tumors, even after multiple cell passages.

**Tumor Microenvironment Preservation:**
Under these conditions, tumor spheroids form quickly, and the spheroids maintain the architecture of the original tissue, including the endothelium, extracellular matrix components, and resident macrophages. PDX models from fresh brain-tumor biopsies display diffuse single-cell infiltration when implanted into the brain of immunodeficient rats or mice.

### 29.3.3 Applications in Drug Development

**Preclinical Testing:**
The value of PDX models in predicting human clinical-trial drug responses was recently highlighted by a study of 1000 PDX cancer models from various primary sites, and by the establishment of a large-scale breast-cancer PDX biobank. This type of large-scale PDX bank is likely to prove valuable for predicting human responses to clinical trials of new glioblastoma drugs, and should help make it possible to tailor therapy to the individual patient.

**Personalized Medicine Applications:**
When a glioblastoma tumor is resected surgically, the tumor cells can be an invaluable source of information that can (and should) be utilized to guide patient treatment (personalized medicine). The tumor cells could potentially be used in a number of platforms, including RNA expression analysis, protein characterization, and metabolic profiling.

### 29.3.4 Technical Considerations and Limitations

**Model Selection:**
There is some controversy as to whether PDX models are best established by injecting freshly biopsied tumor tissue or cultured tumor spheres into mice, and whether orthotopic or subcutaneous xenograft is preferable. While orthotopic xenografts more closely mimic the clinical situation, subcutaneous xenografts are less technically challenging than orthotopic xenografts and are easily passaged in vivo.

**Immunodeficiency Requirements:**
The human tumor cells are transplanted into immunocompromised mice to ensure that the mouse does not reject the human cells. Some common and readily accepted immunocompromised mice are athymic nude mice, severely compromised immunodeficient mice (SCID), or non-obese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice.

### 29.3.5 Organoid Technology

**Three-Dimensional Culture Systems:**
Once targets are identified, appropriate models can be generated to test treatment strategies, including 3D platforms such as ex vivo Organ-on-Chip, in vitro cell culture methods including spheroids and organoids, and of course mouse models, transgenic and/or intracranial xenograft as well as large animals.

**Advantages for Drug Screening:**
However, a disadvantage is that PDOX models are costly and require fresh tumor fragments/cells, therefore limiting the number of facilities that can use these models. In addition to PDOX, other patient derived xenografts can be created by injecting glioblastoma tumor spheres, also known as neurospheres.

## 29.4 Microbiome and Cancer

### 29.4.1 Microbiome Composition and Cancer Development

**Gut Microbiota Fundamentals:**
The understanding of the complex relationship between the human microbiota and its host organism has expanded rapidly in recent years, fuelled by high-throughput metagenomic sequencing technologies, advanced bioinformatics analysis methodology, and the development of experimental model systems. Research focusing primarily on the gut microbiota has led to a growing appreciation of its key role in maintaining health, and of dysbiotic gut microbiome states being associated with many common human disorders, including cancer.

**Carcinogenic Mechanisms:**
To date, bacterial mechanisms that promote carcinogenesis are still incompletely elucidated. However, a few bacterial genotoxins and carcinogens are well described, as well as mechanisms by which bacteria reprogramme host signalling towards neoplastic transformation, promote inflammation, or protect against immunosurveillance.

### 29.4.2 Microbiome's Role in Cancer Therapy

**Immunotherapy Modulation:**
Recent research has uncovered profound effects of the gut microbiota on cancer therapies. Strikingly, response to immunotherapy depends partially on an intact gut microbiota with immunostimulatory function. Whereas antibiotics compromise immunotherapy response, microbiome modulation can enhance it.

**Chemotherapy Interactions:**
The efficacy of cisplatin and oxaliplatin is greatly decreased in mice under germ-free conditions or when their gut microbiome has been perturbed with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The immunogenic cell death that these drugs induce is dependent on inflammatory responses (partially mediated by signalling through pattern recognition receptors), which in mouse models were enhanced by the administration of specific bacterial species.

### 29.4.3 Clinical Implications for Treatment Response

**Predictive Biomarkers:**
Clinical and preclinical studies have indicated that the composition of the gut microbiota is an important cause of heterogeneous patient response to cancer immunotherapy, among several other factors that determine the cancer immune phenotype. These studies have shown that the composition and diversity of a patient's gut microbiota (assessed before the start of treatment) are predictive of the response to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors.

**Site-Specific Associations:**
Moreover, the microbiota colonizing the pancreas was found to play an important role in regulating the inflammatory tone in the pancreatic tumour microenvironment in mice via pattern recognition receptor signalling. However, larger clinical studies are needed to validate individual microbial taxa enriched in pancreatic tissue or in the mouth and the gut of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

### 29.4.4 Therapeutic Microbiome Modulation

**Probiotic Interventions:**
The accumulating evidence that gut microbes affect cancer therapy has reinforced interest in microbiome modulations that aim to improve response rates. Along these lines, preclinical studies have found beneficial effects of probiotics (oral administration of defined live bacterial strains) on progression-free survival in mice when administered alone or in combination with immunotherapy.

**Regulatory Challenges:**
However, current regulations impede the rapid clinical translation of these findings; strict regulation of probiotics as combination therapies with immunotherapeutic treatment modalities necessitates extensive clinical trials. An attractive alternative may be to instead focus on prebiotics (dietary compounds that stimulate the growth of certain gut microbial clades) or diets that are rationally designed to modulate the gut microbiome.

### 29.4.5 Therapeutic Microbes as Cancer Treatment

**Direct Anticancer Applications:**
Some viruses and species of bacteria can be targeted to kill cancer cells while others can be deployed to replicate in and kill tumors. Whereas other bacteria pass through or are killed in the gut, Salmonella cells infect intestinal epithelial cells, where they induce immune responses and attract immune cells. They also infect macrophages, which can be used as delivery vehicles to target Salmonella to tumor tissue.

**Combination Therapy Potential:**
Combining therapeutic microbes with traditional therapies may prove necessary when treating some cases in which cancer or antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are particularly resilient. Moreover, clinical trial protocols likely will require testing therapeutic microbes in combination with standard of care treatments.

## 29.5 Metabolic Targeting Beyond the Warburg Effect

### 29.5.1 Evolution from the Classical Warburg Effect

**Historical Foundation:**
Otto Warburg observed a peculiar phenomenon in 1924, unknowingly laying the foundation for the field of cancer metabolism. While his contemporaries hypothesized that tumor cells derived the energy required for uncontrolled replication from proteolysis and lipolysis, Warburg instead found them to rapidly consume glucose and produce lactate even in the presence of oxygen.

**Beyond Simple Glycolysis:**
Tumor cells exhibit an upregulation in glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and gluconeogenesis as opposed to normal cells. Several oncogenes and tumor suppressors drive the metabolic reprogramming underlying the Warburg effect and other changes in glucose metabolism. There is heterogeneity in glucose metabolism across tumor types as well as within the tumor microenvironment.

### 29.5.2 Metabolic Heterogeneity and Tumor Microenvironment

**Intratumoral Diversity:**
These phenotypes offer cancerous cells one of the most valued assets in their battle for survival: their metabolic diversity, which can explain why it is so difficult to find effective therapies for most cancers. Tumors have different genetic and metabolic phenotypes due to different environmental pressures such as vascularization, oxygen supply, and other factors such as drug treatments.

**Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Interactions:**
Within the TME of solid tumors, heterogeneous cancer cells and CAFs interact by transferring their metabolites, including amino acids, fatty acids, ketone bodies, cytokines, and growth factors, which reciprocally facilitate the growth of cancer cells. Moreover, CAFs provide not only a structural matrix for providing a tumor-friendly microenvironment to cancer cells but also nutrients for cancer cells.

### 29.5.3 Novel Metabolic Targets

**Glutamine Metabolism:**
Hypoxic cells use glutamine to generate citrate from Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±-KG) in response to a reduced supply of glucose-derived citrate. Targeting glutamine metabolism was further investigated not only by their follow-up works but also by other teams. This dependence of cancer cells on glutamine metabolism has translated into clinical trials as a novel therapy for cancer patients.

**Lipid Metabolism:**
According to Ackerman and Simon, adipocytes within TMEs play a key role in increasing lipolysis and secreting fatty acids for energy production, contributing to an aggressive growth phenotype. Lipids produced from adipocytes were used by ovarian cancer cells in order to help tumor growth. These findings suggest that adipocytes are key players in tumor growth by supplying fatty acids.

### 29.5.4 Reverse Warburg Effect and Metabolic Symbiosis

**Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Metabolism:**
Recent studies, however, have revolutionized the way scientists view the TME, especially the cross talk between CAFs and cancer cells and the effect of this cross talk on metabolism. The Warburg effect, a phenomenon initially believed to be limited to cancer cells, has also been observed in the fibroblasts surrounding the cancer cells. To distinguish this CAF-related phenomenon from its cancer cell-related counterpart, Pavlides et al. named it the reverse Warburg effect.

**Metabolic Coupling:**
CAF-derived lactate is crucial in prostate cancer metabolic transformation towards OXPHOS. CAFs can transfer functional mitochondria to prostate cancer cells. CAFs augment cancer's addiction to glutamine and its metabolically relevant consequences. Alanine secreted by pancreatic stellate cells supports tumor metabolism.

### 29.5.5 Therapeutic Implications and Combination Strategies

**Multi-target Approaches:**
Metabolic cross talk between CAFs and cancer can be a metabolic target for cancer therapy. The reverse Warburg effects can be targeted via disruption of the "lactate shuttle" by MCT1/MCT 4 inhibitors. Metformin can be used to inhibit glycolysis and block the function of CAFs, which promote cancer cell growth.

**Clinical Translation Challenges:**
Numerous therapies targeting glucose metabolism have been developed but have yet to show success in clinical trials. Unfortunately, there has been little clinical success given that glycolysis is crucial to the glucose metabolism of normal cells as well. Thus, the focus should be on targeting those elements of aerobic glycolysis, which are more upregulated in cancer.

## 29.6 Novel Combinatorial Approaches

### 29.6.1 Rationale for Combination Therapy

**Tumor Heterogeneity:**
The most compelling rationale for combination chemotherapy, is (1) tumor cell heterogeneity and its implication for drug resistance, and (2) the success of combination chemotherapy in the clinic. There is ample clinical precedent for using multiple agents. Essentially all curative chemotherapy involves combinations of 2 and usually 3 or more agents.

**Overcoming Resistance:**
While tumors are clonal in origin, the increasing DNA instability that accompanies the onset of neoplasia leads to increased variation of daughter cells, referred to as clonal evolution to tumor cell heterogeneity. This is associated with selection for progeny with greater survival capacity, evident as a higher proliferative capacity, resistance to apoptosis, greater metastatic or invasive potential.

### 29.6.2 Mechanisms of Drug Resistance

**Bypass Pathways:**
One type is due to a mutation or genetic event affecting the target of the drug itself so that the kinase is still able to drive the growth of the tumor, despite the continued presence of the drug. Another type of resistance occurs when the cancer uses pathways that bypass the blocked kinase. These bypasses activate the same key downstream tumor growth-promoting signaling pathways.

**Rebound Activation:**
When researchers perturb one signaling pathway with a kinase inhibitor, it often causes rebound activation of these bypass backup pathways such that the effectiveness of the inhibitor is muted. Consequently, combination treatments are needed that target both the kinase and the bypass pathways.

### 29.6.3 Immunotherapy Combinations

**Enhanced Immune Response:**
Combinations with immunotherapies are also needed to fully provide the complexity of an antitumor immune response, and to make such a response more likely to be effective by combining it with chemotherapy or radiation. T cells that are removed from a patient's body and genetically engineered and/or treated with immune stimulants to boost their numbers and/or tumor-killing abilities will be more likely to shrink the patient's tumor if, prior to receiving that treatment, the patient receives "host conditioning" with chemotherapy or radiation.

**Checkpoint Inhibitor Combinations:**
In spite of the unprecedented broad impact of checkpoint blockade inhibitors, only approximately 20% of treated patients benefit from current checkpoint blockade. This limitation has driven extensive research into combination strategies to enhance response rates and overcome resistance.

### 29.6.4 Multi-Modal Treatment Strategies

**Metabolic Combination Approaches:**
Elgogary et al. found that targeting glutamine metabolism using the glutaminase inhibitor bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) encapsulated in nanoparticles effectively shrank pancreatic cancer tumor size and slowed proliferation. They discovered that the combined therapy provided enhanced efficacy that inhibited tumor growth significantly more compared to the single treatment of BPTES or metformin alone.

**Synergistic Targeting:**
These synergistic treatments are beneficial because they can work together when attempting to target different pathways. Still, the challenge remains to affect only the cancerous cells while not having a detrimental impact on benign, healthy cells.

### 29.6.5 Collaborative Drug Development

**Industry Collaboration:**
Perhaps the most important reason for collaboration is to speed up the process of drug development so that effective treatments are delivered sooner to cancer patients, who may not have time on their sides. The mounting evidence that combination targeted or immunotherapies will be more effective than single agents and the need to counter the heterogeneity and evolution of tumors drive collaborative approaches.

**Resource Sharing:**
Participants also stressed the importance of collaboration to develop combination therapies because of the inability of a single drug company to have the resources to effectively and expediently counter the complex mechanisms by which cancer cells become resistant to treatment.

## 29.7 Addressing Treatment Resistance and Relapse

### 29.7.1 Mechanisms of Treatment Resistance

**Primary and Acquired Resistance:**
In general, systemic agents are active at the beginning of therapy in 90% of primary breast cancers and 50% of metastases. However, after a variable period of time, progression occurs. At this point, resistance to therapy is not only common, it is expected. Treatment resistance is most commonly seen in such patients. They initially may have a response to different agents, but the responses are not sustained.

**Genetic Evolution:**
Thus far, MM remains an incurable disease, with a significant number of patients relapsing due to evolving genetic mutations in tumor cells resulting in treatment resistance. The etiology of RRMM is not well understood. Identifying risk factors enables clinicians to implement targeted intervention strategies and preventive measures.

### 29.7.2 Patterns of Relapse

**Disease Recurrence:**
Despite advances in early detection and understanding of the molecular bases of breast cancer biology, approximately 30% of all patients with early-stage breast cancer have recurrent disease, which is metastatic in most cases. The rates of local and systemic recurrence vary within different series, but in general, distant recurrences are dominant.

**Time to Progression:**
Patients who experience a relapse after remission usually die within 1 year, even if a second complete remission is achieved. Most patients with MM will respond well to the first line of therapy, but most will relapse as conventional treatment is not curative.

### 29.7.3 Strategies to Overcome Resistance

**Sequential Therapy Approaches:**
Therapies can be repeated in RRMM depending on prior efficacy and length of remission on the initial response. Clinicians must consider the possibility of cross-resistance among drugs from the same therapeutic group. While choosing treatment options, resistance to a specific class of the drug, the patient's age and other comorbidities, and prior or residual toxicities should be considered.

**Novel Agent Integration:**
Incorporating novel agents into a transplant concept is an exciting new field of investigation, because in many cases, auto-HSCT alone does not lead to cure. To reduce the risk of relapse, well-designed clinical trial with novel agents is necessary.

### 29.7.4 Prevention of Relapse

**Maintenance Therapy:**
Relapse has become the most frequent cause of treatment failure after HSCT. Because outcome after relapse remains poor, major effect is focused on prevention of relapse. Beside adoptive cell-based options, such as DLI, the availability of novel effective pharmacological compounds has opened new avenues in clinical research to use those drugs early after HSCT in order to prevent relapse.

**Targeted Prevention Strategies:**
Anti-CD30 antibody drugs conjugate brentuximab vedotin as maintenance therapy after auto-HSCT for HL did improve PFS but not OS. Bispecific antibodies such as CD19-directed CD3 T-cell-engaged blinatumomab are active in relapsed and refractory ALL and also in MRD positive ALL.

### 29.7.5 Future Directions in Resistance Management

**Personalized Resistance Profiling:**
Chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance assays are laboratory tests that pretend to select the most appropriate treatment by studying an individual's tumor behavior when exposed to certain drugs. The goal is to individualize therapy, optimize resources, and reduce toxicity.

**Adaptive Treatment Strategies:**
While certain subpopulations with defined metabolic phenotypes may be sensitive to a suitable metabolic inhibitor, other subclones with different metabolic phenotypes may well be resistant to that drug. This explains why patients may become unresponsive to second-round treatment after an initial successful first round.

## Conclusion

The future of cancer treatment research lies at the intersection of these seven transformative approaches. Liquid biopsies promise to revolutionize early detection and monitoring, while artificial intelligence enhances our ability to analyze complex datasets and predict treatment responses. Patient-derived models provide more accurate platforms for drug testing, and our growing understanding of the microbiome opens new therapeutic avenues.

The recognition that cancer metabolism extends far beyond the Warburg effect has revealed numerous new targets, while the imperative for combination therapies addresses the fundamental challenge of tumor heterogeneity. Finally, our evolving strategies to combat treatment resistance and relapse offer hope for more durable responses.

Success in translating these advances into clinical practice will require continued collaboration across disciplines, integration of multiple technological platforms, and a commitment to addressing the complex, adaptive nature of cancer. The convergence of these approaches holds unprecedented promise for improving outcomes for cancer patients in the decades ahead.
