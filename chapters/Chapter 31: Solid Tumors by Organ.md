# Chapter 31: Solid Tumors by Organ/System

Cancer represents a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Understanding the organ-specific manifestations of solid tumors is essential for medical and nursing professionals, as each tumor type presents unique epidemiological patterns, pathophysiology, diagnostic challenges, and therapeutic approaches. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the most clinically significant solid tumors, organized by organ system.

## 31.1 Breast Cancer

### 31.1.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women and the second most common cause of death from cancer among women worldwide. As of 2020, breast cancer has become the most diagnosed cancer globally, overtaking lung and prostate cancers. In the UK, breast cancer represents almost a third of all newly diagnosed cancers, with a crude incidence rate of 76.3 per 100,000 persons, though all except 287 cases were found in women.

Most breast cancer is sporadic (90%-95%), with only 5% to 10% of patients having an identifiable genetic mutation. BRCA 1 and 2 are the most common associated genetic conditions. There are no pathognomonic features distinguishing breast and ovarian cancers occurring in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants from those occurring in noncarriers.

### 31.1.2 Pathology and Molecular Subtypes

Invasive ductal and invasive lobular carcinoma are the most common pathologic forms of invasive breast cancer. Carcinogenesis occurs due to a complex interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors, hormonal influences, and patient-related factors.

The molecular classification of breast cancer has revolutionized treatment approaches:

**Luminal A**: Hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 negative

**Luminal B**: Hormone receptor-positive, HER-2 positive

**HER2-enriched**: HER-2 enriched tumors are more aggressive, with a poor prognosis without targeted therapy

**Triple-negative**: TNBC is defined as the absence of staining for ER, PR, and HER2/neu. TNBC is insensitive to some of the most effective therapies available for breast cancer treatment including HER2-directed therapy such as trastuzumab and endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen or the aromatase inhibitors.

### 31.1.3 Staging and Prognosis

Breast cancer staging is determined clinically and histologically. Clinical breast cancer staging is based on physical examination and imaging studies before treatment. Histopathologic breast cancer staging is determined by pathologic examination of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes after definitive surgical treatment.

The Pathological Prognostic Stage Group table is used for all patients in the United States who have surgery as initial treatment and have pathological T and N information reported.

### 31.1.4 Treatment Approaches

Breast cancer treatment is nuanced and based on various factors, including the disease stage, pathology, patient preference, and available resources. In general, breast cancer management approaches are divided into early breast cancer, locally advanced breast cancer, and metastatic breast cancer treatment.

**Early Breast Cancer**: Early breast cancer includes tumors <5 cm in size without clinically positive lymph nodes. Treatment involves surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and hormonal therapy, depending on the stage and molecular profile.

**Surgical Options**: Surgical treatment: Options to excise the primary tumor include breast conservation surgery (eg, partial mastectomy or lumpectomy) or a total mastectomy.

**Systemic Therapy**: Combination cytotoxic chemotherapy administered in a dose-dense or metronomic schedule remains the standard therapy for early-stage TNBC.

## 31.2 Lung Cancer

### 31.2.1 Epidemiology and Classification

Lung cancer or bronchogenic carcinoma refers to tumors originating in the lung parenchyma or within the bronchi. It is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Since 1987, lung cancer has been responsible for more deaths in women than breast cancer. Lung cancer is a diagnosis that approximately 230,000 United States citizens will receive annually. Deaths are estimated at 135,000 patients per year.

Lung cancer is histologically divided into 2 main types: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC comprises about 15% of lung cancer while NSCLC comprises approximately 85%.

### 31.2.2 Risk Factors

Approximately 80% of lung cancer cases in men and 90% of cases in women are associated with smoking. SCC is more strongly associated with smoking than any other type of NSCLC. Other risk factors for SCC include age, family history, exposure to second-hand smoke, and exposure to minerals, metal particles, or asbestos.

### 31.2.3 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

**Pathological Subtypes**:
Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common primary lung cancer seen in the United States. It falls under the umbrella of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has a strong association with previous smoking. Adenocarcinoma of the lung usually evolves from the mucosal glands and represents about 40% of all lung cancers.

Adenosquamous carcinomas are lung tumors with more than 10% glandular and squamous components. This is an uncommon and highly aggressive lung tumor, and current recommendations propose adjuvant chemotherapy even in Stage I radically resected tumors.

**Staging and Prognosis**:
Metabolic activity on PET scan has been shown to have a poor prognosis in stages I-IV NSCLC. Recurrence after complete resection has been cited at 41 percent, with the median time to recurrence at 11.5 months and median survival of 8.1 months.

### 31.2.4 Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)

The main criteria for determining LD and ED are whether a reasonable radiation plan can safely encompass disease extent. Two-thirds of patients present with extensive stage or metastatic disease.

Close to 70% of patients with small cell lung cancer have disseminated disease at the time of presentation.

### 31.2.5 Treatment Approaches

**NSCLC Treatment**:
Treatment varies based on the patient's functional status, comorbidities, tumor stage, and molecular characteristics of the disease. Patients who have stage I, II, or III NSCLC are treated with the intent to cure. This can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT), or a combined modality approach.

Surgery is the treatment for patients with stage I to stage IIIA adenocarcinoma of the lung. Lobectomy or a pneumonectomy are often performed. Since these patients have a high risk of relapse, adjuvant chemotherapy is now standard.

**SCLC Treatment**:
Patients with extensive-stage disease are treated with chemotherapy with radiation (RT) reserved for select candidates and palliation.

## 31.3 Colorectal Cancer

### 31.3.1 Epidemiology and Natural History

In the United States, colon cancer is diagnosed in approximately 100,000 patients and rectal cancer is diagnosed in another 50,000 each year. These cancers most commonly affect older adults, with 90 percent of cases diagnosed in individuals older than 50 years. Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignant tumor and the fourth most common cause of cancer death in the world.

Most colorectal cancers develop slowly over decades. The process involves a gradual accumulation of genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations. The first histologically detectable change is development of aberrant crypt foci in the lining of the intestine.

### 31.3.2 Pathology and Molecular Features

The pathological histological types mainly include papillary adenocarcinoma, tubular adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, signet-ring cell carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and carcinoid carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma has the highest incidence, accounting for more than 90%.

This process often involves abnormal changes of multiple genes, such as APC, DCC, P53, K-RAS, C-MYC, BRAF, MCC, and MMR-related genes.

### 31.3.3 Staging System

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) 2017 is currently the preferred staging system for colorectal cancer.

**TNM Classification**:
- **T1**: Tumor invades the submucosa (through the muscularis mucosa but not into the muscularis propria)
- **T3**: Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues
- **T4**: Tumor invades the visceral peritoneum or invades or adheres to adjacent organ or structure

### 31.3.4 Prognosis and Treatment

The prognosis for colon cancer depends on the stage. The most important prognostic indicator is the pathological stage, supported by SEER data. The 5-year overall survival rate for colon cancer stage I is 74%, for stage IIA is 66%, for stage IIB is 58%, for stage IIC is 37%, for stage IIIA is 73%, for stage IIIB is 46%, for stage IIIC is 28%, and stage IV is 5%.

The disease stage at initial diagnosis is the most important prognostic indicator of CRC. It has been reported that the 5-year survival rate of patients with localized CRC, who can be surgically resected, is about 90%, while the 5-year survival rate of advanced CRC patients who lose the opportunity of surgical treatment is reduced to about 10%.

### 31.3.5 Screening and Early Detection

Direct evidence from multiple well-conducted randomized trials supports the effectiveness of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) in decreasing colon cancer incidence and reducing mortality from colorectal cancer compared with no screening for average-risk adults over age 50.

Colonoscopy can visually observe the shape, size, and location of colorectal lesions. Most importantly, it can obtain pathological biopsy specimens, which is an important means for CRC screening and diagnosis.

## 31.4 Genitourinary Cancers

### 31.4.1 Prostate Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Based on the Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine resource, prostate cancer represents one of the most common malignancies in men, with incidence rates varying significantly by age, race, and geographic location.

**Pathology**: The majority of prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas arising from the peripheral zone of the gland. The Gleason grading system remains the standard for histologic assessment.

**Treatment**: Treatment decisions depend on tumor stage, patient age, life expectancy, and comorbidities. Options include active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy.

### 31.4.2 Bladder Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Bladder cancer predominantly affects older adults, with smoking being the primary risk factor. Occupational exposures to certain chemicals also increase risk.

**Pathology**: Transitional cell carcinoma (urothelial carcinoma) represents approximately 90% of bladder cancers. Classification into non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive disease determines treatment approach.

**Treatment**: Non-muscle-invasive disease may be managed with transurethral resection and intravesical therapy, while muscle-invasive disease typically requires radical cystectomy or definitive radiation therapy.

### 31.4.3 Kidney Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Renal cell carcinoma represents the most common kidney cancer in adults, with clear cell carcinoma being the predominant histologic subtype.

**Clinical Presentation**: The classic triad of flank pain, hematuria, and palpable mass is present in less than 20% of cases. Most tumors are now detected incidentally on imaging.

**Treatment**: Surgery remains the primary treatment for localized disease, while systemic therapy with targeted agents has revolutionized the treatment of metastatic disease.

## 31.5 Gynecologic Cancers

### 31.5.1 Cervical Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Cervical cancer incidence has declined significantly in developed countries due to screening programs. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the primary cause.

**Pathology**: Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are the predominant histologic types. The transformation zone is the most common site of origin.

**Treatment**: Treatment depends on stage and includes surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or combinations thereof.

### 31.5.2 Ovarian Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among gynecologic cancers. Most cases are diagnosed at advanced stages.

**Pathology**: Epithelial ovarian cancers represent the majority of cases, with serous adenocarcinoma being the most common subtype.

**Treatment**: Standard treatment involves cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, with maintenance therapy increasingly utilized.

### 31.5.3 Endometrial Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in developed countries. Risk factors include obesity, diabetes, and unopposed estrogen exposure.

**Pathology**: Adenocarcinoma is the predominant histologic type, with molecular classification becoming increasingly important for treatment decisions.

**Treatment**: Surgery is the primary treatment, with adjuvant therapy based on risk factors and molecular features.

## 31.6 Gastrointestinal Cancers

### 31.6.1 Gastric Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Gastric cancer incidence varies dramatically worldwide, with the highest rates in East Asia. Helicobacter pylori infection is a major risk factor.

**Pathology**: Adenocarcinoma represents the majority of gastric cancers, with classification into intestinal and diffuse types having prognostic significance.

**Treatment**: Surgery remains the primary curative treatment, with perioperative chemotherapy improving outcomes in advanced disease.

### 31.6.2 Pancreatic Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis, with five-year survival rates below 10%. Risk factors include smoking, diabetes, and genetic syndromes.

**Pathology**: Ductal adenocarcinoma represents approximately 90% of pancreatic cancers, with most arising in the head of the pancreas.

**Treatment**: Surgery offers the only chance for cure, but is possible in only 15-20% of patients. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy play palliative roles.

### 31.6.3 Liver Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary liver cancer, often developing in the setting of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.

**Pathology**: Hepatocellular carcinoma arising from hepatocytes is the predominant type, with risk factors including hepatitis B and C infections.

**Treatment**: Treatment options include surgery, transplantation, ablation, embolization, and systemic therapy, depending on liver function and tumor extent.

## 31.7 Head and Neck Cancers

### 31.7.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Head and neck cancers represent a diverse group of malignancies arising from the mucosa of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and paranasal sinuses. Tobacco and alcohol use are the primary risk factors, with human papillomavirus (HPV) emerging as an important cause of oropharyngeal cancers.

### 31.7.2 Pathology

Squamous cell carcinoma represents approximately 90% of head and neck cancers. HPV-positive tumors have distinct molecular features and improved prognosis compared to HPV-negative tumors.

### 31.7.3 Treatment

Treatment typically involves multimodal approaches combining surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Organ preservation strategies are increasingly emphasized when feasible.

## 31.8 Skin Cancers

### 31.8.1 Melanoma

**Epidemiology**: Melanoma incidence has increased dramatically over recent decades, particularly in fair-skinned populations. UV radiation exposure is the primary risk factor.

**Pathology**: Melanoma arises from melanocytes and can occur in sun-exposed or sun-protected areas. Breslow thickness and ulceration are key prognostic factors.

**Treatment**: Surgery remains the primary treatment for localized disease, with adjuvant therapy and immunotherapy having revolutionized treatment of advanced disease.

### 31.8.2 Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer

**Basal Cell Carcinoma**: The most common skin cancer, typically with local invasion but rare metastasis.

**Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: More aggressive than basal cell carcinoma with potential for metastasis, particularly in immunocompromised patients.

## 31.9 Clinical Implications and Future Directions

### 31.9.1 Personalized Medicine

The era of personalized medicine has transformed cancer care, with molecular profiling increasingly guiding treatment decisions across tumor types. Biomarkers for prognosis, treatment selection, and monitoring response continue to evolve.

### 31.9.2 Multidisciplinary Care

Physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals must work together to streamline the patient's journey, from diagnosis through treatment and follow-up. Coordination minimizes errors, reduces delays, and enhances patient safety, ultimately leading to improved outcomes and patient-centered care.

### 31.9.3 Supportive Care

Comprehensive cancer care extends beyond tumor-directed therapy to include symptom management, psychosocial support, and quality of life considerations. Integration of supportive care throughout the cancer continuum improves patient outcomes.

### 31.9.4 Prevention and Early Detection

Prevention strategies, including lifestyle modifications and vaccination programs, represent the most effective approaches to reducing cancer burden. Screening programs continue to evolve with technological advances and improved risk stratification.

## Summary

Solid tumors represent a diverse group of malignancies with distinct epidemiological, pathological, and clinical characteristics. Understanding the organ-specific features of common cancers is essential for healthcare providers to deliver optimal patient care. As our understanding of cancer biology continues to evolve, treatment approaches become increasingly personalized, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary care and comprehensive patient management.

The future of cancer care lies in continued advances in molecular diagnostics, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and precision medicine approaches.
