# Chapter 16: Tumor Immunology

## 16.1 Immune Surveillance and Escape

The relationship between the immune system and cancer represents one of the most complex and dynamic interactions in human biology. The concept of immune surveillance of tumors implies that a component of the immune system has evolved for the elimination of neoplastic cells, and this system provides protection of an organism from abnormal growth of cells and subsequent tumor development.

### 16.1.1 The Concept of Immune Surveillance

**Historical Perspective and Theoretical Foundation**

The concept of immune surveillance was first articulated by Burnet, who called the ability of the immune system to detect tumor cells and destroy them 'immune surveillance.' This concept implies that development and progression of tumor cells result from a failure of the surveillance system either to recognize tumor cells or to successfully express the relevant effector mechanisms.

In contrast to responses to invading infectious agents, tumor surveillance must include mechanisms that recognize "self" tumor cells as different from normal cells for targeting of their destruction. This concept also implies that development and progression of tumor cells result from a failure of the surveillance system either to recognize tumor cells or to successfully express the relevant effector mechanisms.

**Evidence for Immune Surveillance**

While the study of tumor immunity has developed in fits and starts during the course of the past century, it is now well established that there are both nonadaptive and adaptive elements of the immune system that are responsible for the surveillance and elimination of tumor cells.

Experiments in animals have, however, provided evidence for immune responses to tumors and have shown that T cells are a critical mediator of tumor immunity. Transplantable tumors in mice exhibit a variable pattern of growth when injected into syngeneic recipients. Most tumors grow progressively and eventually kill the host. However, if mice are injected with irradiated tumor cells that cannot grow, they are frequently protected against subsequent injection with a normally lethal dose of viable cells of the same tumor.

**Limitations of Immune Surveillance**

However, it is difficult to show that tumors are subject to surveillance by the immune system; after all, cancer is a common disease, and most tumors show little evidence of immunological control. The incidence of the common tumors in mice that lack lymphocytes is little different from their incidence in mice with normal immune systems; the same is true for humans deficient in T cells.

The major tumor types that occur with increased frequency in immunodeficient mice or humans are virus-associated tumors; immune surveillance thus seems to be critical for control of virus-associated tumors, but the immune system does not normally respond to the novel antigens deriving from the multiple genetic alterations in spontaneous tumors.

### 16.1.2 Mechanisms of Tumor Immune Evasion

**The Three Es: Elimination, Equilibrium, and Escape**

In the Darwinian TME, tumour cell-centred and host cell-centred mechanisms of immune evasion drive progression, invasion, and metastasis. Failure of effective immunity is associated with progression and the appearance of clinical cancer.

Appropriately activated T cells and innate immune effectors (natural killer [NK] cells) mediate early elimination of transformed cells and limit progression. T-cell-orchestrated type 1 immune responses mediate host resistance during the early phases of carcinogenesis. Moreover, in human tumours, the presence of T cells and type 1 immunity or interferon signatures is associated with better prognosis.

**Tumor Cell-Intrinsic Escape Mechanisms**

**Loss of MHC Class I Expression:**
Some tumors, such as colon and cervical cancers, lose the expression of a particular MHC class I molecule, perhaps through immunoselection by T cells specific for a peptide presented by that MHC class I molecule. In experimental studies, when a tumor loses expression of all MHC class I molecules, it can no longer be recognized by cytotoxic T cells, although it might become susceptible to NK cells.

However, tumors that lose only one MHC class I molecule might be able to avoid recognition by specific CD8 cytotoxic T cells while remaining resistant to NK cells, conferring a selective advantage in vivo.

**Antigen Loss and Immunoediting:**
Tumors tend to be genetically unstable and can lose their antigens by mutation; in the event of an immune response, this instability might generate mutants that can escape the immune response. Cancer cells can escape immune recognition via "immunoediting," allowing cancer cell clones without detectable cancer antigens to dominate and escape from the pressure of immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Mechanisms of physical exclusion (e.g. extracellular matrix deposition), and selection of less immunogenic variants, can hamper effective recognition.

### 16.1.3 Host-Mediated Immune Dysfunction

**T-Cell Exhaustion**

T-cell exhaustion is an effector T-cell-intrinsic mechanism for failure to mount an effective immune response. Single-cell genomic analysis has provided new vistas on the T-cell receptor repertoire and functional properties of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes.

**Regulatory T Cell Activity**

Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) have long been associated with immunosuppression in cancer. Single-cell analysis has led to the identification of molecules expressed by infiltrating Treg cells. For instance, the IL-1 decoy receptor IL-1R2 was found to be expressed at very high levels in infiltrating Treg cells.

**Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells**

Even though this defense system is well developed, the tumor often has the ability to develop an immunosuppressive microenvironment favorable to its progression. Specifically, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), regulatory T (Treg) cells, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are well-known players.

## 16.2 Tumor Antigens and Neoantigens

The identification and characterization of tumor antigens has been a central focus in cancer immunology, as these molecules represent the targets that enable the immune system to distinguish malignant cells from their normal counterparts.

### 16.2.1 Definition and Classification of Tumor Antigens

**Fundamental Concepts**

The term "tumor antigen" has been given a new and much more precise definition as a result of important developments in immunology over the last decade, particularly in the area of antigen presentation and antigen recognition. For something to be a tumor antigen, it must be recognized by specific immune effector cells and/or antibodies and be produced by tumor cells.

Among the tumor antigens, some may be tumor specific while others may also be expressed by normal tissues. The molecular characterization of T cell-defined antigens has allowed the definition of tumor epitopes recognized by T cells.

**Antigen Presentation Pathways**

CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL) recognize small peptides (8–10 amino acids long) that have been processed from a larger protein from tumor cells and presented in the peptide-binding cleft of MHC class I molecules on the surface of the tumor cells.

While still located within intracellular compartments, these tumor peptides associate with nascent MHC class I or class II molecules and are subsequently transported to the cell surface, where they become accessible to T-cell scrutiny.

**Proteasomal Processing**

The ability of a given peptide to bind to, and be presented by, a given MHC allele is determined by structural motifs within the peptide sequence that allow for sufficient compatibility between peptide amino side-chains and micropockets formed within the peptide-binding groove of the MHC molecule.

In the presence of IFN-γ, the catalytic subunits of standard proteasomes are replaced by alternate subunits to form the immunoproteasome. This novel proteolytic complex exhibits enzymatic specificities that differ from the standard proteasome, resulting in a modified repertoire of processed peptides.

### 16.2.2 Categories of Tumor Antigens

**Tumor-Associated Antigens (TAAs)**

The molecular characterization of tumor antigens has allowed a better understanding of the genetic events that may give rise to tumor-specific antigens. Tumor antigens can be loosely categorized as oncofetal (typically only expressed in fetal tissues and in cancerous somatic cells), oncoviral (encoded by tumorigenic transforming viruses), overexpressed/accumulated (expressed by both normal and neoplastic tissue, with the level of expression highly elevated in neoplasia), cancer-testis (expressed only by cancer cells and adult reproductive tissues such as testis and placenta), lineage-restricted (expressed largely by a single cancer histotype), mutated (only expressed by cancer as a result of genetic mutation or alteration in transcription), posttranslationally altered (tumor-associated alterations in glycosylation, etc.), or idiotypic (highly polymorphic genes where a tumor cell expresses a specific "clonotype").

**Oncofetal Antigens**

These antigens are typically only expressed in fetal tissues and in cancerous somatic cells. Examples include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which are re-expressed during carcinogenesis despite being normally absent in adult tissues.

**Cancer-Testis Antigens**

This category includes antigens expressed only by cancer cells and adult reproductive tissues such as testis and placenta. These antigens are particularly attractive targets for immunotherapy because their expression is restricted to tumors and immune-privileged sites.

**Overexpressed/Accumulated Antigens**

These are expressed by both normal and neoplastic tissue, with the level of expression highly elevated in neoplasia. For example, the p53 tumor-suppressor gene product is frequently mutated in cancer cells, resulting in the accumulation of p53 protein in these cells in concert with reduced cell-cycle regulatory control by the tumor cells.

### 16.2.3 Neoantigens: The New Frontier

**Definition and Origin of Neoantigens**

TSAs are highly specific and typically result from genetic mutations within malignant cells that give rise to neoantigens not present in untransformed (nonmalignant) cells. By definition, there is a low likelihood of 'on-target off-tumour' toxicity because the tumour antigen is not expressed on normal cells.

Evidence in mouse and human tumours has indicated that mutations and genetic instability represent the fundamental molecular basis for T-cell-dependent anti-tumour immunity. The intersection of genomics and the dissection of immunity is paving the way to personalized immunotherapy approaches.

**Advantages of Neoantigens**

Neoantigens offer several advantages as immunotherapeutic targets:

1. **True tumor specificity**: Should not be expressed on normal tissue cells, at least not in nonessential normal tissues (i.e., tumour specific)
2. **No central tolerance**: Because these antigens are not present during T-cell development, there is no deletion of reactive T cells in the thymus
3. **High immunogenicity**: Novel sequences can be readily recognized as foreign by the immune system

**Clinical Implications**

Unfortunately, no nonpolymorphic tumour-specific extracellular target antigens are known. However, the identification of patient-specific neoantigens through genomic analysis opens possibilities for personalized cancer vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies.

### 16.2.4 Melanoma Antigens: A Model System

**Discovery and Characterization**

In melanoma, tumor-specific antigens were discovered by culturing irradiated tumor cells with autologous lymphocytes, a reaction known as the mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell culture. From such cultures, cytotoxic T lymphocytes could be identified that would kill, in an MHC-restricted fashion, tumor cells bearing the relevant tumor-specific antigen.

These studies have yielded three important findings. The first is that melanomas carry at least five different antigens that can be recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The second is that cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive against melanoma antigens are not expanded in vivo, suggesting that these antigens are not immunogenic in vivo.

The third is that the expression of these antigens can be selected against in vitro and possibly also in vivo by the presence of specific cytotoxic T cells.

**Clinical Relevance**

Functional melanoma-specific T cells can be propagated from peripheral blood lymphocytes, from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or by draining the lymph nodes of patients in whom the melanoma is growing. Interestingly, none of the peptides recognized by these T cells derives from the mutant proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that are likely to be responsible for the initial transformation of the cell into a cancer cell, although a few are the products of mutant genes.

## 16.3 Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses

The immune system's response to cancer involves a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immunity, with each arm contributing distinct but complementary functions in tumor recognition and elimination.

### 16.3.1 Innate Immune Responses to Cancer

**Natural Killer (NK) Cells**

Natural killer cells are innate lymphoid cells that have long been considered to play a role in resistance against haematogenous dissemination of cancer cells, in particular to the lungs. The natural killer cells are the third major part of the innate immune system. Their main job is to identify cells that have been infected by a virus, as well as abnormal cells that may turn into (or have turned into) tumor cells.

**NK Cell Recognition Mechanisms**

NK cells monitor the level of class I MHC proteins, which are expressed on the surface of most vertebrate cells. The presence of high levels of these proteins inhibits the killing activity of NK cells, so that the NK cells selectively kill cells expressing low levels of class I MHC proteins.

These cells detect infected cells (mainly infected by viruses) or malignant cells in which expression of MHC molecules has decreased, is altered or abolished. NK cells have the ability to distinguish the normal host cells through the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and CD94-NKG2A inhibitory receptors which recognize the MHC class I expressed on the surface of these normal cells.

**NK Cell Effector Functions**

NK cells have granules with perforins and granzymes that act on target cells inducing lysis or apoptosis and also express PRRs including TLR-2, -3, -4, -5, -7, and -8. Once activated, NK cells secrete IFN-γ, TNF-α growth factors, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and chemokines.

The differentiation and activity of NK cells are also controlled by negative regulators. Recently, novel NK cell checkpoints (e.g. IL-1R8) were identified, and unleashed NK cells were found to mediate resistance to carcinogenesis and metastasis at NK-cell-rich anatomical sites, such as the liver and the lung.

**Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs)**

Inflammatory cells, in particular TAMs, pave the way to tissue invasion and intravasation and provide a nurturing microenvironment for metastasis, serving as a component of the cancer cell niche at distant sites.

As expected given the complexity and diversity of the roles of innate and adaptive immunity, infiltration of different components of the immune system has different, at times divergent, prognostic significance. Infiltration of TAMs is generally associated with worse prognosis, which is a reflection of their pro-tumour function. However, infiltration of TAMs is associated with better prognosis in colorectal cancer.

### 16.3.2 Adaptive Immune Responses to Cancer

**T-Cell Mediated Immunity**

The immune system's antitumor activity is mainly carried out by tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), T effector (Teff) cells, antibody-producing B cells, as well as antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DC), which lead to adaptive immunity by directly recognizing and eliminating cancer cells.

**Helper T Cell Subsets**

Helper T cells are arguably the most important cells in adaptive immunity, as they are required for almost all adaptive immune responses. They not only help activate B cells to secrete antibodies and macrophages to destroy ingested microbes, but they also help activate cytotoxic T cells to kill infected target cells.

The specific cytokines present during the process of helper T cell activation influence the type of effector cell produced. Thus, the decision of naïve helper T cells to differentiate into TH1 or TH2 effector cells influences the type of adaptive immune response that will be mounted against the pathogen—whether it will be dominated by macrophage activation or by antibody production.

**T-Cell Activation Requirements**

To activate a cytotoxic or helper T cell to proliferate and differentiate into an effector cell, an antigen-presenting cell provides two kinds of signals. Signal 1 is provided by a foreign peptide bound to an MHC protein on the surface of the presenting cell. This peptide-MHC complex signals through the T cell receptor and its associated proteins. Signal 2 is provided by costimulatory proteins, especially the B7 proteins (CD80 and CD86), which are recognized by the co-receptor protein CD28 on the surface of the T cell.

### 16.3.3 The Role of Dendritic Cells

**Antigen Presentation Function**

Dendritic cells (DC) are a widely distributed group of cells specialized in antigen sampling. In fact, they also constitute the most efficient antigen presenting cells for T cell activation, hence being the linking bridge between innate and adaptive immune responses.

The function of dendritic cells, however, is not primarily to destroy pathogens but to carry pathogen antigens to peripheral lymphoid organs and there present them to T lymphocytes. When a dendritic cell takes up a pathogen in infected tissue, it becomes activated, and travels to a nearby lymph node.

**Maturation and Migration**

On activation, the dendritic cell matures into a highly effective antigen-presenting cell (APC) and undergoes changes that enable it to activate pathogen-specific lymphocytes that it encounters in the lymph node. Activated dendritic cells secrete cytokines that influence both innate and adaptive immune responses, making these cells essential gatekeepers that determine whether and how the immune system responds to the presence of infectious agents.

### 16.3.4 B-Cell Responses in Cancer

**Humoral Immunity**

In antibody responses, B cells are activated to secrete antibodies, which are proteins called immunoglobulins. The antibodies circulate in the bloodstream and permeate the other body fluids, where they bind specifically to the foreign antigen that stimulated their production.

**Tumor-Promoting B-Cell Functions**

However, evidence suggests that B cells can contribute to tumour progression in certain epithelial tumours, such as prostate cancer. B-cell-mediated tumour promotion has been shown to involve different mechanisms, such as production of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10) and/or production of antibodies and formation of immune complexes that skew TAMs in an M2-like direction.

## 16.4 Tumor-Induced Immune Suppression

Cancer cells have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to suppress and evade immune responses, creating an environment that favors tumor growth and progression while undermining effective anti-tumor immunity.

### 16.4.1 Immunosuppressive Factors Produced by Tumors

**Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β)**

There is ample evidence that tumor cells produce immunosuppressive factors, and this has been verified to have local as well as systemic effects on immune function. Recent reports using a variety of tumor models have indicated that either the elimination of TGF-β or the inhibition of its function is of significance for tumorigenicity and/or immunogenicity of gliomas.

For instance, Jachimczak and colleagues treated human gliomas with TGF-β2-specific phosphorothioate-antisense (AS) oligodeoxynucleotides and determined that this resulted in a marked reduction in tumor-mediated suppression of lymphocyte proliferative responses to IL-2.

**Prostaglandins (PGs)**

PGs can also induce the production of IL-10, which has immunosuppressive effects. Over the past decade, a number of reports have provided data indicating that tumor cells can either directly produce PGs or induce macrophages in the tumor microenvironment to secrete PGs.

For instance, several reports indicate that tumors, including colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) and head and neck cancers, produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and this is responsible for some of the immunosuppressive effects associated with these tumors.

The pathway responsible for these effects has recently been elucidated as being a consequence of cyclooxygenase (COX) overexpression in cancer cells, particularly COX-2. Overexpression of COX-2 results in increased production of PGs by tumor cells and, in the case of PGE2, results in an upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, in tumor cells.

### 16.4.2 Activation-Induced Cell Death (AICD)

**Fas-FasL Pathway**

Dysfunctional immune responses can result as some tumor cells express Fas ligand (FasL) and bind Fas expressed on some infiltrating lymphocytes resulting in AICD seems to be differentially regulated in T-helper subsets. Upon stimulation with phorbol ester and ionomycin or anti-TCR:CD3 Ab, Th1 clones express significantly higher levels of surface FasL than do Th2 clones.

**Clinical Significance**

AICD is considered to be one of the mechanisms responsible for the increased apoptotic rate among TILs. Thus, antigenic stimulation within the tumor microenvironment might be involved in the enhanced expression and function of FasL on T cells, resulting in activation-induced cell death of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

### 16.4.3 Metabolic Immunosuppression

**Competition for Nutrients**

Rapidly growing tumor cells require nutrients, oxygen, and essential metabolites to proliferate and, at the same time, create an immunosuppressive microenvironment. How immune cells and cancer cells share or compete in these harsh environmental conditions and how the TME alters immunometabolism are important questions to address.

**Hypoxia and Acidification**

As the tumor grows larger, (1) oxygen supply becomes limited, thus creating a hypoxic condition; (2) nutrients become deficient; and (3) the microenvironment becomes acidic. Recent findings suggest that these harsh metabolic states significantly disrupt T-cell function.

Therefore, the influence of cancer cell metabolism on the TME may directly control the metabolic pathways in surrounding T cells. The tumor microenvironment physically constitutes a barrier against T-cell infiltration, as it is a compact structure with tight interactions among cancer cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, and ECM.

### 16.4.4 Checkpoint Inhibition and Immune Suppression

**PD-1/PD-L1 Pathway**

The PD-1 pathway is active in many tumor types, and unlike ligands for CTLA-4, which are expressed everywhere in the body on antigen-presenting cells, PD-L1 (the major ligand for PD-1) is selectively expressed in cancers and at sites of inflammation.

**CTLA-4 Pathway**

Tumour progression and escape are associated with immunosuppressive pathways in innate and adaptive anti-tumour responses, which include, among others, suppressive myeloid cells, activation of checkpoint blockade, and induction and recruitment of Treg cells.

**Clinical Applications**

Immunotherapy in the form of PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cells is now part of the anticancer armamentarium. In spite of the unprecedented broad impact of checkpoint blockade inhibitors, only approximately 20% of treated patients benefit from current checkpoint blockade.

## Clinical Implications and Therapeutic Applications

Understanding tumor immunology has led to revolutionary advances in cancer treatment, with immunotherapy emerging as a major pillar of cancer care alongside surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

### Immunotherapeutic Approaches

**Checkpoint Inhibitors**

The use of monoclonal antibodies can be used in cancer immunotherapy (eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). These drugs include pembrolizumab and atezolizumab. These ICIs unlock the immune system, which is then able to recognize tumors and kill them.

Anti-PD-1 drugs have been successful in treating advanced cancers that resist standard treatments. Once researchers gained an understanding of how the PD-1 pathway works, they were able to leverage that knowledge to develop mechanistic biomarkers and FDA-approved anti-PD-1 therapies.

**CAR T-Cell Therapy**

CAR T-cell therapy, or Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy, is a groundbreaking immunotherapy approach used to treat certain types of cancer. CAR T-cell therapy involves engineering a patient's T cells in the laboratory to specifically target and kill their tumors.

This approach has been challenging in solid tumors but much more successful in blood cancers, especially when applied to naive and early memory T cells, which have enormous proliferation capacity and long-term persistence potential.

**Adoptive Cell Transfer**

Growing evidence has suggested that lack of eradication of the malignant stem cell forms the basis for cancer relapse and progression. These data set the stage for newer approaches that focus on immune targeting of antigens that are present on the cancer stem cell.

### Future Directions

As we better understand fundamental mechanisms, including novel checkpoints, targeting of tumour-promoting myeloid cells, and harnessing NK cell potential, these advances hold promise to help predict which patients will be responsive, thus sparing toxicity and contributing to the financial sustainability and to the improvement of therapeutic results.

The goal in the development of anti-cancer vaccines is to break the tolerance of the immune system for antigens expressed mainly or exclusively by the tumor. It is not surprising that spontaneously arising tumors are rarely rejected by T cells, as in general they probably lack either distinctive antigenic peptides or the adhesion or co-stimulatory molecules needed to elicit a primary T-cell response.
