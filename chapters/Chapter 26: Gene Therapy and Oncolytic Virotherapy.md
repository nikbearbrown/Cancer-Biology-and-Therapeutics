# Chapter 26: Gene Therapy and Oncolytic Virotherapy

## 26.1 Principles of Gene Therapy for Cancer

Gene therapy represents a revolutionary approach to cancer treatment that involves the administration of specific genetic material to modify or manipulate gene expression for therapeutic purposes. According to regulatory definitions, gene therapy involves the administration of specific genetic material (DNA or RNA) via a carrier, known as a "vector," that enables the foreign genetic material to enter target cells. In cancer treatment, gene therapy primarily aims to selectively kill or suppress the growth of malignant cells through various mechanisms.

### 26.1.1 Fundamental Concepts

Gene therapy encompasses several distinct approaches to cancer treatment:

**Gene Replacement Therapy**
* Provides working copies of damaged or deleted tumor suppressor genes
* Restores normal cellular functions disrupted in malignant transformation
* Examples include p53 gene replacement in tumors with p53 mutations

**Gene Addition Therapy**
* Delivers genes encoding prodrug-converting enzymes followed by systemic administration of nontoxic prodrugs, termed "suicide gene therapy"
* Introduces genes encoding cytotoxic proteins directly toxic to cancer cells
* Supplies genes for immunomodulatory molecules to enhance antitumor immunity

**Gene Silencing Therapy**
* Uses antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit oncogene expression, such as targeting c-fos protooncogene to decrease mRNA levels and inhibit growth
* Employs RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress oncogene function
* Blocks expression of genes promoting tumor survival and proliferation

**Immunomodulatory Gene Therapy**
* Delivers genes encoding costimulatory molecules like B7-1 to enhance antitumor immune responses
* Introduces cytokine genes to activate immune effector cells
* Transfers genes for tumor-associated antigens to stimulate immune recognition

### 26.1.2 Therapeutic Mechanisms

Gene therapy for cancer operates through several key mechanisms:

**Suicide Gene Therapy**
This approach exploits the delivery of genes encoding prodrug-converting enzymes to tumor cells, followed by systemic administration of nontoxic prodrugs. Cells transduced to express the prodrug enzyme confer conversion of the prodrug to active metabolites and thereby selective cytotoxicity. The most extensively studied systems include:

* **Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk)/ganciclovir**: HSV-tk phosphorylates ganciclovir to a toxic metabolite that interferes with DNA synthesis
* **Cytosine deaminase/5-fluorocytosine**: Bacterial or yeast cytosine deaminase converts 5-fluorocytosine to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil
* **Purine nucleoside phosphorylase/6-methylpurine deoxyriboside**: Generates toxic purines that disrupt cellular metabolism

**Tumor Suppressor Gene Replacement**
The p53 tumor suppressor is induced in cellular response to genotoxic agents, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and oncogene expression. In the response to DNA damage, p53 activates genes involved in cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, and induction of apoptosis. Replacement of mutated p53 can restore:
* Cell cycle checkpoint control
* DNA damage response mechanisms
* Apoptotic pathways in response to oncogenic stress

**Antisense and RNA Interference**
Gene silencing approaches target overexpressed oncogenes and survival factors:
* Antisense strategies have targeted various oncogenes including myb protooncogene in hematopoietic and melanoma cells, and c-fos in breast carcinoma cells
* siRNA and miRNA approaches can silence multiple oncogenic pathways simultaneously
* Targeting angiogenic factors like VEGF to disrupt tumor vascularization

## 26.2 Gene Editing Technologies

Gene editing represents the next generation of gene therapy, offering unprecedented precision in modifying cellular DNA to correct genetic defects or confer therapeutic properties. Unlike traditional gene therapy that adds genetic material, gene editing directly modifies existing genomic sequences.

### 26.2.1 CRISPR/Cas9 System

**Mechanism of Action**
The CRISPR/Cas9 system is rapidly becoming the tool of choice for gene editing due to its ease of use, flexibility, and versatility. The system consists of:

* **Guide RNA (gRNA)**: A synthetic RNA sequence that directs the Cas9 nuclease to specific genomic locations
* **Cas9 endonuclease**: A programmable nuclease that creates double-strand breaks at target sites
* **Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)**: A short DNA sequence required for Cas9 recognition and binding

**Applications in Cancer Research and Therapy**
CRISPR has been used as a treatment for medical conditions in two ways: ex vivo and in vivo gene editing. Ex vivo gene editing involves harvesting cells from the patient, editing the cells with CRISPR while they are outside of the body, then returning them to the patient through infusion.

*Cancer-Specific Applications*:
* Understanding the genetic mechanisms that underlie cancer development and investigating the functional relevance of potential drug targets in cancer cells
* Creating cancer cell models for drug screening and therapeutic development
* Engineering immune cells to enhance anticancer responses
* Correcting oncogenic mutations in patient-derived cells

**Current Clinical Development**
The first therapeutics based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technologies are entering the market. Exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), sold under the brand name Casgevy, is the first and only CRISPR-based therapy to receive regulatory approval anywhere internationally.

### 26.2.2 Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs) and TALENs

**Zinc Finger Nucleases**
ZFNs represent the first generation of programmable nucleases:
* Consist of engineered zinc finger DNA-binding domains fused to nuclease domains
* Each zinc finger recognizes 3-4 base pairs of DNA
* Multiple zinc fingers can be combined to target longer DNA sequences
* ZFN- and TALEN-based technologies are difficult to engineer, time-consuming, and expensive, limiting their clinical application

**Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs)**
TALENs offer improved specificity over ZFNs:
* Each TALE repeat recognizes a single nucleotide
* More modular and predictable than zinc fingers
* Can target longer DNA sequences with high specificity
* Still require extensive engineering for each target

**Clinical Applications**
Previous technologies using molecules known as zinc finger nucleases and TALENs had made it possible to alter DNA at targeted locations. While these technologies are currently being used in clinical trials, they are cumbersome and difficult to use.

### 26.2.3 Safety Considerations and Off-Target Effects

**Off-Target Cleavage Concerns**
Concerns about the potential risk of unwanted off-target effects have dominated many recent discussions. Most experiments that have detected significant off-targets have been performed in cancer cells, which may have altered DNA repair pathways that could lead to elevated off-target events.

**Risk Mitigation Strategies**
* Improved guide RNA design algorithms to predict and minimize off-target sites
* Use of high-fidelity Cas9 variants with reduced off-target activity
* Delivery optimization to limit exposure time and concentration
* Comprehensive genomic screening for unintended modifications

**Regulatory Considerations**
Despite its capabilities, CRISPR-Cas9 still has deficiencies. It can alter DNA at locations other than the target, which could inactivate essential genes, activate cancer-causing genes, or cause chromosomal rearrangements.

## 26.3 Viral Vectors: Mechanisms of Action and Safety

Viral vectors represent the most efficient and widely used delivery systems for gene therapy, exploiting the natural ability of viruses to enter cells and deliver genetic material to specific cellular compartments.

### 26.3.1 Retroviral Vectors

**Structure and Function**
Retroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that consist of the 5′ and 3′ long-terminal repeats (LTRs) and the gag, pol, and env structural genes. Gag encodes three proteins that form the shell of the virion. Pol encodes reverse transcriptase, integrase, and ribonuclease H, which are necessary for viral integration into host chromosomal DNA.

**Advantages of Retroviral Vectors**
* Retroviruses integrate into target cell DNA and thus achieve stable integration of the transgene. Theoretically, stable integration should provide long-term expression
* Capable of transducing a wide variety of human cell types
* Replication-deficient vectors provide safety advantages
* Well-characterized manufacturing and production systems

**Limitations and Safety Concerns**
* An important limitation of Mo-MuLV-based retroviral vectors is that they integrate only into actively dividing cells. As most solid tumors have low growth fractions, it is unlikely that these retroviral vectors would transduce a significant proportion of the tumor
* Retroviral-vector-mediated insertional mutagenesis could result in transformation of the transduced target cell, as demonstrated in nonhuman primates that developed hematologic malignancies following treatment with high doses of retroviral vectors containing replication-competent helper viruses
* Expression is not maintained indefinitely; retroviral promoters have a tendency to become inactivated over time

### 26.3.2 Adenoviral Vectors

**Vector Design and Characteristics**
Adenoviruses are nonenveloped, linear, double-stranded DNA viruses. The prototype adenoviral vector for gene therapy is based on adenovirus type 5 (Ad5). Adenoviral vectors have been based on the observation that deletion of the E1A and part of the E1B gene results in replication-deficient viruses.

**Advantages**
* Most human cell types are susceptible to adenoviral infection and are subject to efficient transduction. Additionally, adenoviruses can deliver transgenes to both dividing and nondividing cells
* High-titer vector production (10¹¹ to 10¹² PFU/mL)
* Because adenoviral DNA is episomal, insertional mutagenesis is much less of a concern than it is for retroviral vectors
* Large cloning capacity (up to 8.5 kb of foreign DNA)

**Disadvantages and Immunogenicity**
* A major disadvantage of current adenoviral vectors is the induction of a significant host immune response. A T-cell-mediated response against adenoviral proteins causes a local inflammatory reaction that can result in lysis of the transduced cells and a shorter duration of transgene expression
* Development of neutralizing antibodies limits repeated administration
* As most humans have been exposed to wild-type adenovirus and harbor neutralizing antibodies, these vectors may be quickly cleared when administered in clinical trials

### 26.3.3 Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) Vectors

**Vector Properties**
Adeno-associated viruses are small, nonenveloped, linear single-stranded DNA parvoviruses that are naturally replication deficient. AAV-2 is the predominant serotype used in gene therapy approaches.

**Advantages of AAV Vectors**
* rAAVs are naturally replication defective and are considered nonpathogenic. Also, deletion of the Rep and Cap ORFs, and thereby expression of viral proteins, decreases immunogenicity
* rAAVs have a broad tissue tropism as a consequence of attachment of AAV-2 to the ubiquitously expressed cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan
* Unlike retroviruses, rAAVs transduce both replicating and nonreplicating cells
* Potential for site-specific integration into chromosome 19

**Limitations**
* rAAV can accommodate only 4 kb of DNA insert
* Deletion of the Rep ORF abolishes the site-specific integration of AAV into chromosome 19
* Pre-existing immunity in human populations may limit efficacy

### 26.3.4 Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Vectors

**Vector Design**
HSV-1 is a herpes virus that is naturally neurotropic and also infects epithelial cells. The HSV-1 genome is approximately 150 kb and encodes about 90 proteins.

**Helper-Dependent and Independent Systems**
* Helper virus-dependent vectors have also been termed amplicons. Amplicons are defective HSV genomes that arise spontaneously by recombination and are amplified by serial passage at high multiplicities of infection
* Helper virus-independent HSV-1 viral vectors have deletions in essential viral genes. These HSV-1 vectors replicate to high titers and can insert up to 40 kb of foreign DNA

**Safety Considerations**
* Potential for recombination and reversion to wild-type phenotype
* Wild-type HSV-1 infection is associated with neurologic sequelae, making recombination a concern in using helper-virus-independent HSV-1-based vectors
* Requires complementing cell lines for propagation

## 26.4 Oncolytic Virotherapy

Oncolytic virotherapy represents a unique approach to cancer treatment that exploits replication-competent viruses engineered to selectively replicate in and destroy cancer cells while sparing normal tissues.

### 26.4.1 Principles of Viral Oncolysis

**Historical Background and Modern Rationale**
The concept of viral oncolysis was introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1904, Dock reported a dramatic remission of leukemia in a woman following a presumed infection by influenza virus. More recently, the replicative life cycle of many viruses has been elucidated at the molecular level, including the sequence of viral genomes and the functions of viral proteins, leading to a more "rational" approach.

**Mechanism of Selective Tumor Targeting**
The use of a replicating virus as an antitumor agent is based on the premise that successful viral replication results in multiple viral progeny being released from destroyed cells to infect surrounding cells. Inoculation of a tumor with a competent virus thus results in death of infected tumor cells as the virus replicates throughout the tumor.

**Exploiting Cellular Defense Defects**
A common theme emerging from studying the interaction of viruses with cells is the presence of viral proteins whose function is to overcome host-cell antiviral defenses. Two examples of cellular antiviral defenses include double-strand RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and the tumor-suppressor protein p53.

### 26.4.2 Engineered Oncolytic Viruses

**Adenovirus-Based Oncolytic Agents**
Because p53 is mutated or deleted in approximately 50% of human tumors, p53-mediated antiviral defense mechanisms are not available to those cells. To exploit this tumor cell phenotype, an adenovirus (dl1520; ONYX-015) with a deletion in the 55-kilodalton E1B gene was created.

*ONYX-015 Mechanism*:
* Replicates preferentially in cells with nonfunctional p53
* dl1520 may be able to preferentially replicate in tumor cells with inactivating mutations in p53 or p14ARF, as well as in cells with activating mutations in Mdm2
* Clinical trials have shown enhanced efficacy when combined with chemotherapy

**Herpes Simplex Virus Oncolytic Agents**
HSV-1 encodes many nonessential gene products that are homologous to cellular proteins preferentially expressed in cycling cells. Examples include thymidine kinase, ribonucleotide reductase, dUTPase, and uracil DNA glycosylase.

*G207 and Other HSV Variants*:
* G207 was generated by deleting the ribonucleotide reductase and γ134.5 genes of HSV-1. With deletions in two genes, this virus has a lower probability of reversion to wild-type phenotype, thereby increasing its safety profile
* The deletion of ribonucleotide reductase targets the virus to cycling cells, and deletion of the γ134.5 gene may target cells with an activated Ras pathway

**Reovirus as a Natural Oncolytic Agent**
Reovirus is a double-stranded RNA virus associated with mild upper respiratory infections or enteritis. The interest in reovirus oncolytic therapy rests in its natural safety profile, with a lack of associated disease pathology upon wild-type reovirus infection.

*Ras-Dependent Replication*:
* The translation of these observations in employing reovirus as an oncolytic virus is coupled with the fact that 30% of human tumors have Ras-activating mutations. Tumors harboring such mutations would be predicted to permit reovirus replication
* Targets gliomas, colorectal, and ovarian cancers with activated Ras pathways

### 26.4.3 Transcriptionally Targeted Oncolytic Viruses

**Tumor-Specific Promoter Control**
Another technique to achieve tumor-specific cytotoxicity with replication-competent viruses is to place expression of viral essential genes under the transcriptional control of tumor-specific promoter/enhancer sequences.

**Examples of Tissue-Specific Targeting**
* To target hepatocellular carcinoma cells, the promoter/enhancer of the α-fetoprotein gene has been placed upstream to the E1 sequences. This virus replicates selectively in hepatocellular carcinoma cells that overexpress α-fetoprotein
* The engineered adenovirus CN706 was constructed by placing the promoter/enhancer region of the PSA gene upstream of the E1A gene. This virus replicates to high titers in prostate cancer cells overexpressing PSA
* To target MUC1-positive tumor cells, the E1A gene has been placed under the control of the DF3/MUC1 promoter/enhancer sequences

### 26.4.4 Safety Considerations and Clinical Applications

**Safety Requirements**
With the use of live, attenuated viruses for cancer therapy, certain safety considerations are warranted. The attenuated virus should be genetically stable such that mutants do not revert to wild-type phenotypes. Engineering multiple mutations into the therapeutic virus can minimize reversion.

**Combination Strategies**
Ionizing radiation enhances the therapeutic potential of both replication-competent adenovirus and HSV-1 in part by increasing the replication potential of the viruses. A variety of chemotherapeutic agents have also been reported to augment the efficacy of replication-conditional adenovirus and HSV-1.

## 26.5 Current Trials and Clinical Use

### 26.5.5 Future Directions and Emerging Technologies

**Next-Generation Editing Systems**
Newer gene editing systems are even more powerful than the CRISPR-Cas9 system discovered by Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier. Many techniques, including base, prime, and epigenetic editing, may prove useful interventions for a broad range of genetic and acquired diseases.

**Delivery Improvements**
Improved techniques have enhanced the efficiency, precision, and accuracy of the editing process, yet effective delivery and editing remains difficult for many tissues of the body. Further research to diversify and increase the efficiency, specificity, and safety of editing-delivery systems is essential.

**Regulatory Evolution**
Extended long-term follow-up is essential to fully understand the consequences of an edit and to identify any unanticipated effects, should they occur. Regulatory frameworks continue to evolve to address the unique challenges posed by gene editing technologies while ensuring patient safety and therapeutic efficacy.

The field of gene therapy and oncolytic virotherapy continues to advance rapidly, offering new hope for patients with previously untreatable conditions. As these technologies mature, their integration into standard medical practice will require continued advances in delivery systems, safety monitoring, manufacturing capabilities, and healthcare infrastructure. The success of early approved therapies provides a foundation for the next generation of genetic medicines that promise to transform cancer treatment and beyond.
