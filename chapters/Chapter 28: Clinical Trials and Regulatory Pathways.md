# Chapter 28: Clinical Trials and Regulatory Pathways

## 28.1 Trial Phases and Design

### 28.1.1 Historical Context and Evolution

The modern clinical trial system emerged from the recognition that new medical interventions required systematic evaluation before widespread implementation. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) of 1906 was the first federal law to establish the FDA as the main regulatory body for all medications in the United States. This role became more complex with the Durham-Humphrey Amendment of 1951 and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA). These legislative milestones established the foundation for the rigorous testing requirements that characterize contemporary drug development.

In 1961, thalidomide was shown to cause severe congenital disabilities after being marketed in Europe, prompting increased regulations on medication development. The passage of the Kefauver-Harris Amendment in 1962 would allow the FDA to require proof that drugs were both safe and effective before approval. This amendment contained provisions for obtaining informed consent for clinical trials and initiated Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).

### 28.1.2 Preclinical Development

Before any human testing can begin, extensive preclinical research must be conducted. Safety information from preclinical testing is used to support a request to FDA to begin testing the experimental intervention in studies with humans. These studies include laboratory investigations, animal testing, and comprehensive toxicology assessments to provide preliminary evidence that the experimental intervention will be safe and effective for humans.

Before testing with humans begins, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application is filed with the FDA. If the IND application is approved, then clinical trials can begin. The IND must include preclinical data, proposed drug use, safety data from animal studies, and the proposed plan for human studies.

### 28.1.3 Phase I Trials: First-in-Human Studies

Phase I trials are the earliest-stage clinical trials used to study an experimental drug in humans, are typically small (less than 100 participants), and are often used to determine the toxicity and maximum safe dose of a new drug. They provide an initial evaluation of a drug's safety and pharmacokinetics.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
- Characterize pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
- Identify dose-limiting toxicities
- Determine optimal dosing schedule

Phase I trials may involve small numbers (20 to 100) of healthy volunteers, or they may include patients with specific conditions for which targeted pathways have been identified as potentially relevant to the disease under study. A Phase I study may last for several months. In oncology, Some phase I trials, for example, those of studies of treatments for cancer, are performed with individuals with advanced disease who have failed all other standard treatments.

**Design Considerations:**
Phase I trials typically employ dose-escalation designs to systematically identify the appropriate dose for subsequent phases. Common approaches include the traditional 3+3 design, continual reassessment methods, and accelerated titration designs.

### 28.1.4 Phase II Trials: Preliminary Efficacy Assessment

Phase II trials assess the effectiveness of the drug, with continued attention to safety and noncritical side effects, and define the clinical endpoints for the assessment of Phase II and III data. Phase II studies may involve up to several hundred participants who have the disease under study, compared with 20 to 100 healthy individuals in Phase I trials, in which subjects are often randomized.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Assess preliminary efficacy in the target population
- Further characterize safety profile
- Determine optimal dose and schedule for Phase III
- Refine patient selection criteria

Phase II trials are often aimed at gathering preliminary data on whether a drug has clinical efficacy and usually involve 100 to 300 participants. Frequently, phase II trials are used to determine the efficacy and safety of an intervention in participants with the disease for which a new intervention is being developed.

**Design Types:**
- Single-arm studies for rare diseases or when historical controls are appropriate
- Randomized Phase II trials comparing multiple experimental arms
- Selection designs to identify the most promising treatment for Phase III testing

### 28.1.5 Phase III Trials: Definitive Efficacy Studies

Phase III trials are considered the "gold standard" for changing medical practice because the results of these trials are used to obtain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, establish practice guidelines, and make insurance coverage decisions. They are also the most complex and costly trials to conduct.

These trials are both larger (several hundred or even more patients) and longer (one to four years). Often, initiation of Phase III trials occurs after a meeting between the FDA and the drug company sponsoring the trial and the FDA to clarify and agree on the basis for evaluating the drug.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Large sample sizes (hundreds to thousands of participants)
- Randomized, controlled design
- Often multicenter and international
- Primary endpoints typically overall survival or disease-free survival
- Rigorous statistical design with pre-specified analysis plans

Phase III trials are advanced-stage clinical trials designed to show conclusively how well a drug works. Phase III trials are usually larger, frequently multi-institutional studies, and typically involve from a hundred to thousands of participants. They are comparative in nature, with participants usually assigned by chance to at least two arms, one of which serves as a control or a reference arm and one or more of which involve new interventions.

**Pivotal Trials:**
Some phase II and phase III trials are designed as pivotal trials (sometimes also called confirmatory trials), which are adequately controlled trials in which the hypotheses are stated in advance and evaluated. The goal of a pivotal trial is to attempt to eliminate systematic biases and increase the statistical power of a trial. Pivotal trials are intended to provide firm evidence of safety and efficacy.

### 28.1.6 Phase IV Trials: Post-Marketing Surveillance

Phase IV trials are studies conducted after a drug receives regulatory approval from the FDA. They may be used primarily for medical marketing. In some cases, the FDA may require or companies may voluntarily undertake postapproval studies to generate additional information about a drug's long-term safety and efficacy, including its risks, benefits, and optimal use.

Phase IV trials are also used to assess the long-term effects of an intervention and to reveal rare but serious side effects. These studies may take various forms, including:
- Registry studies
- Large simple trials
- Comparative effectiveness research
- Long-term safety surveillance

### 28.1.7 Innovative Trial Designs

**Adaptive Designs:**
Modern oncology increasingly employs adaptive trial designs that allow for modifications based on accumulating data while maintaining scientific integrity. These include:
- Seamless Phase II/III designs
- Biomarker-adaptive trials
- Population enrichment strategies

**Basket and Umbrella Trials:**
Biomarker-based treatments also have the possibility to span across tumour sites and are likely to be assessed using innovative study designs, such as basket and umbrella trials. These designs allow for the efficient evaluation of targeted therapies across multiple cancer types or the simultaneous testing of multiple treatments within a single disease.

## 28.2 FDA/EMA Approval Processes

### 28.2.1 FDA Regulatory Framework

**New Drug Application (NDA) Process:**
The manufacturer submits the data from all three clinical trial phases and from the preclinical studies to the FDA in a new drug application (NDA) to market the substance for specific indications. An NDA also contains detailed information on the laboratory formulation and chemistry of the drug, the manufacturing process, quality control procedures, the proposed labeling of the drug, and samples of the drug in its proposed dose and form.

The data from all three phases, but particularly those from Phase III, form the basis for the FDA's decision on approval, including its specification of indications and other parts of the official label.

**Review Timeline:**
The process of review usually takes 10 to 12 months and may include an advisory committee review, but such a review is at the discretion of the FDA.

**Biologics License Application (BLA):**
The approval process for biologics is quite similar to that for drugs, in part because the FDA merged the two Bureaus of Drugs and Biologics from 1982 to 1987 into the Center for Drugs and Biologics. Biologics, however, are regulated under a regime based on the Public Health Service Act of 1944 rather than the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act. Although the evaluation process parallels the drug evaluation process, manufacturers submit a product license application (PLA) rather than an NDA.

### 28.2.2 FDA Expedited Review Programs

The FDA has established several pathways to accelerate the development and review of drugs that address unmet medical needs:

**Fast Track Designation:**
Fast-track review can be requested for IND applications for drugs that fulfill an unmet medical need. Fast-track review allows drug sponsors to meet with the FDA to advance drug development.

**Breakthrough Therapy Designation:**
Breakthrough therapy review can be requested for drugs with clinical data demonstrating significant improvement over existing drugs. Breakthrough drugs also allow drug sponsors to meet with the FDA and sometimes enable sponsors to avoid components of the standard review process.

**Accelerated Approval:**
Accelerated approval is intended for developing drugs with long-term clinical endpoints that may be difficult to measure during clinical trials. Other expedited review programs may also be used alongside accelerated approval.

**Priority Review:**
Priority review can be used for an NDA or BLA to decrease the FDA review period and may be combined with other expedited review programs.

### 28.2.3 FDA Oncology-Specific Initiatives

Review staff within the two divisions of oncology products will specialize in specific oncologic diseases (e.g., breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, melanoma), an approach that Dr. Pazdur noted mirrors what is currently being done in academic comprehensive cancer centers. The motivation for this restructuring was to encourage more consistency of review and improved career building of the FDA staff through increased interaction among FDA staff and outside academic investigators.

In addition, recognizing the growing need to combine unapproved drugs, the agency has created the DHOT, a toxicology-pharmacology division that will focus not just on routine toxicology, but on mechanisms of action. The agency also is hiring people to become thematic leaders, including leaders with expertise in clinical pharmacology or biomarkers.

### 28.2.4 European Medicines Agency (EMA) Framework

**Centralized Procedure:**
The "centralized" procedure works with one single application for a licence, which is then valid for the entire EU; this route is compulsory for some product types, in particular those derived from biotechnology, and for those containing a new active substance licensed after May 2004 and intended to treat the priority conditions of HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases or diabetes.

**EMA Organizational Structure:**
EMA has regulatory policies in place to support and incentivize drug development for rare diseases and conditions, including an orphan designation program, mechanisms for expedited review, and opportunities for sponsors and people with lived rare disease experience to engage with the agency.

**Authority and Recommendations:**
EMA is a decentralized agency of the European Union (EU) that is responsible for evaluating the safety and efficacy of drugs in Europe. However, it does not have the authority to approve medications. Instead, EMA can issue guidance and make authorization recommendations on medical products that the European Commission ultimately approves for marketing in the European Union.

### 28.2.5 EMA Expedited Pathways

There are four expedited authorization pathways for drugs available through EMA. Each program has its own eligibility criteria, process, and benefits. While these pathways are available for any medicine that meets the criteria, they may be particularly relevant for products with orphan designation because orphan products are more likely to meet the criteria of the programs (e.g., meeting an unmet need, intended to treat a life-threatening disease, extremely rare indication).

**Conditional Marketing Authorization:**
Conditional approval from the EMA is a form of conditional marketing authorisation for those medicines that target unmet medical needs for serious conditions with a positive benefit–risk balance, but that do not have sufficient data to support traditional approval.

### 28.2.6 Harmonization and Global Considerations

**International Council for Harmonisation (ICH):**
Both FDA and EMA participate in ICH guidelines, which provide internationally accepted standards for drug development, including Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards that govern clinical trial conduct.

**Approval Rate Comparisons:**
Overall, there was little difference in EMA approval rates for orphan and non-orphan medicine applications (see Figure 3-4) and no discernable differences in approval rates across therapeutic areas.

### 28.2.7 Regulatory Science and Evidence Standards

Dr. Rothenberg suggested that traditional end points for cancer clinical trials, such as overall survival, may not be adequate, especially for assessing the value of newer targeted therapies, and should perhaps be supplanted by other end points that are biologically significant and predictive of outcome but have not served as a basis for regulatory review or approval.

Increased investment in regulatory science studies that assess how best to craft regulations on the basis of the scientific evidence, as recently advocated by the FDA commissioner, might aid with the determination of such data standards.

## 28.3 Compassionate Use and Expanded Access

### 28.3.1 Historical Development

By the end of the 1960s, this concept had been incorporated into the compassionate use IND, which also covered the provision of experimental drugs to patients during FDA review of a new drug application, or NDA (the document submitted by a sponsor after the completion of clinical trials to request permission for marketing).

The expanded access framework evolved through several key developments:
- 1960s: Compassionate use IND established
- 1970s: Open-label safety studies and Group C cancer drug IND
- 1987: Treatment IND regulations finalized

### 28.3.2 Treatment IND Framework

The treatment IND mechanism allows patients suffering from serious or life-threatening conditions for which there is no satisfactory alternative therapy to obtain a promising experimental drug.

**Eligibility Criteria:**
The treatment IND pathway requires:
- Serious or immediately life-threatening disease
- No comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy available
- Drug under investigation in controlled clinical trials
- Evidence of potential effectiveness that would justify the potential risks

**Regulatory Evolution:**
In June 1983, the FDA issued proposed regulations that included a very broad interpretation of the use of investigational drugs for therapeutic purposes: at any time during the investigational process, the FDA could approve a treatment protocol for any patient with a serious disease (the definition of "serious" was left to the discretion of the patient and physician).

### 28.3.3 Contemporary Expanded Access Programs

**Individual Patient Access:**
The most restrictive form of expanded access, reserved for individual patients with serious conditions when:
- No approved treatment alternatives exist
- Patient cannot participate in ongoing clinical trials
- Potential benefits justify potential risks

**Intermediate-Size Patient Population Access:**
For groups of patients (usually fewer than widespread distribution) who:
- Have disease or condition for which there is no approved treatment
- Do not meet eligibility criteria for ongoing clinical trials
- Would benefit from investigational treatment

**Widespread Treatment Access:**
For large numbers of patients when:
- Safety and effectiveness data from Phase III trials support broader access
- Manufacturing capacity allows for expanded distribution
- Mechanism exists to ensure appropriate use

### 28.3.4 Right to Try Legislation

In addition to FDA expanded access programs, "Right to Try" legislation at the state and federal levels has created additional pathways for terminally ill patients to access investigational treatments that have completed Phase I testing.

### 28.3.5 Safety Monitoring and Data Collection

**Ongoing Oversight:**
Serious or life-threatening adverse effects, and all deaths possibly linked to the treatment, must be reported (to the sponsor in the case of non-IND studies and to FDA in the case of those under INDs) expeditiously. All sponsors and FDA have the authority to terminate trials for reasons of patient safety or for poor performance of various types.

**Data Requirements:**
Expanded access programs typically require:
- Informed consent documentation
- Safety reporting
- Limited efficacy data collection
- Regular safety updates to FDA

### 28.3.6 Ethical Considerations

**Balancing Access and Scientific Rigor:**
Expanded access programs must balance compassionate provision of potentially beneficial treatments with the need to maintain scientific integrity of ongoing clinical trials. Key considerations include:

- Ensuring expanded access does not compromise enrollment in controlled trials
- Maintaining appropriate safety oversight
- Collecting meaningful safety and efficacy data
- Protecting vulnerable patient populations

**Informed Consent:**
Patients must understand:
- Investigational nature of the treatment
- Potential risks and benefits
- Alternative treatment options
- Right to withdraw from expanded access treatment

### 28.3.7 Global Perspectives

**European Medicines Agency:**
The Agency seeks knowledge from CSOs to improve the quality of its work and substantiate its scientific opinions, while CSOs offer their experience as patients and expertise as patients' representatives to promote their main interest, namely ensuring better access to safe and innovative medicines and high quality information.

EMA has established similar compassionate use programs, often coordinated with national competent authorities in EU member states.

### 28.3.8 Impact on Drug Development

**Lessons from Expanded Access:**
In the second week of March 1990, headlines across the country described an unusual scientific controversy over the distribution of an investigational drug called dideoxyinosine (ddI) to thousands of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Newspapers reported that patients receiving the drug through a new expanded access program had a much higher death rate than patients enrolled in conventional clinical trials of the drug.

This case highlighted the importance of:
- Careful patient selection for expanded access
- Appropriate safety monitoring
- Recognition that expanded access populations may differ from clinical trial populations
- Need for ongoing safety assessment

### 28.3.9 Future Directions

**Real-World Evidence Integration:**
Expanded access programs increasingly serve as sources of real-world evidence to:
- Supplement clinical trial data
- Inform post-marketing surveillance
- Guide clinical practice recommendations
- Support regulatory decision-making

**Digital Health Integration:**
Technology platforms are being developed to:
- Streamline expanded access applications
- Improve safety monitoring
- Facilitate data collection and analysis
- Enhance patient-physician communication

The landscape of clinical trials and regulatory pathways continues to evolve, driven by scientific advances, patient advocacy, and the need to bring effective treatments to patients as rapidly and safely as possible. Understanding these frameworks is essential for clinicians involved in cancer care, as they directly impact treatment availability and clinical decision-making.
