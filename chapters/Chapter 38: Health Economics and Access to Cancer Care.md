# Chapter 38: Health Economics and Access to Cancer Care

## Introduction

Cancer care represents one of the most complex and resource-intensive areas of modern medicine, presenting significant economic challenges for patients, healthcare systems, and society as a whole. The current fee-for-service reimbursement structure provides an incentive to prescribe more chemotherapy and other expensive treatments even when the patient may not be likely to benefit from them, while the United States spends far more than other nations on health care, in proportion to its earnings as a nation. 

The economic burden of cancer care extends beyond direct medical costs to encompass broader societal implications, including lost productivity, caregiver burden, and the opportunity costs of healthcare resource allocation. Many patients lack access to affordable, high-quality cancer care. There are major disparities in cancer outcomes among individuals who are of lower socioeconomic status, are racial or ethnic minorities, and who are underinsured or lack health insurance coverage. Understanding these economic dimensions is crucial for medical and nursing professionals who will encounter patients struggling with financial barriers to optimal cancer care.

## 38.1 Drug Pricing and Affordability

### The Economic Framework of Cancer Drug Pricing

Cancer drug pricing operates within a complex economic ecosystem that significantly impacts patient access to care. Oncology drugs comprise about one-third of all drugs given a fast track approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the quicker time to market via this regulatory pathway boosts the potential value of the drug. This accelerated pathway, while beneficial for bringing life-saving treatments to market quickly, contributes to the high cost structure of cancer therapeutics.

The pricing mechanisms for cancer drugs differ fundamentally from other pharmaceutical categories. In practice, many plans place cancer drugs on a third or fourth tier, and patients are expected to pay a percentage of the cost through coinsurance. This tiered system creates substantial financial barriers for patients, particularly those with advanced disease requiring multiple treatment lines.

### Financial Impact on Patients

The financial burden on individual patients can be devastating. For Revlimid, a cancer drug, a patient enrolled in Part D in 2016 faced total annual out-of-pocket costs of $11,538 for this drug alone in 2016, 76 percent of which was in the catastrophic coverage phase of the benefit. These costs have continued to escalate, with the price for Revlimid has since increased dramatically, to more than $18,000 per fill; thus, in the catastrophic phase under Part D, enrollees will pay more than $900 per month for this drug.

The concept of "financial toxicity" has emerged as healthcare professionals recognize that treatment costs can be as debilitating as the disease itself. Cancer treatment has become increasingly expensive, partially due to the use of specialty drugs. The costs of these drugs are often passed down to patients, who may face the consequences of paying for more than they can afford, leading to financial toxicity. Molecular and immune therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment and improved patient outcomes and survival. However, the pricing of these drugs has become an issue as the cost of cancer care continues to rise significantly. Cost sharing policies have increased out-of-pocket expenses for patients, leading to poorer financial well-being, quality of life, psychosocial health, and treatment adherence. People with cancer are at higher risk for bankruptcy than people without a cancer diagnosis. The financial cost of cancer treatment in the United States is astronomically high and is expected to rise. The economic burden of cancer care increasingly falls on the patients. Patients thus experience "financial toxicity" of cancer care that can have catastrophic consequences on health and quality of life.

Rising costs of cancer care drive patient financial toxicity (FT) that perpetuates known health disparities in access and quality cancer treatment. This financial stress not only affects immediate treatment decisions but can have long-term consequences for patients and their families, including delayed care, treatment abandonment, and reduced quality of life.

### Healthcare System Economics

From a healthcare system perspective, cancer care represents a significant portion of overall medical expenditures. Peter Eisenberg, an oncologist at Marin Specialty Care, noted that in his community practice, six doctors purchase about $8 million worth of chemotherapy each year, and sell it for about $10 million. The difference pays their salaries and practice expenses. This practice model creates inherent conflicts of interest where "Without selling chemotherapy, we wouldn't be in business," he said. "Doctors, like everybody else, respond to incentives."

The current reimbursement structure contributes to rising costs through several mechanisms. McClellan noted that as insurers have decreased their physician payments in order to cut costs, many oncologists' practice revenues have been driven by the profit margin made on the chemotherapies they administer to their patients. This creates a perverse incentive where more expensive treatments generate higher revenues for providers, regardless of their comparative effectiveness.

### International Pricing Comparisons

Global variation in pharmaceutical pricing policies reveals different approaches to managing drug costs. While most other developed nations have governmental mechanisms for negotiating or controlling prescription drug prices, either directly or de facto, there is no nationwide regulation of drug pricing in the United States. 

Countries like Australia have implemented comprehensive evaluation systems. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), an independent body appointed by the Australian government that decides which medicines are approved and which are not. When deciding whether to list a medicine on the PBS, the PBAC assesses the national disease burden, the medicine's clinical effectiveness, its safety, and cost-effectiveness compared with alternative treatments.

### Value-Based Pricing Approaches

The concept of value-based pricing has gained traction as a potential solution to rising drug costs. Chalkidou stressed that because of U.S. payers' willingness to pay the high prices of drugs, there is a disconnect between return on investment and value for money in the pharmaceutical industry. However, implementation faces significant regulatory barriers. Hartstein noted that CMS, which is the biggest payer for cancer care in this country, is prohibited from negotiating prices and interfering with the practice of medicine. In addition, the ACA specifically prohibits the use of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) or other metrics.

This paper examines the issue of prices, relative to value, for cancer drugs. Faced with largely price-insensitive consumers and payers, manufacturers would rationally charge high prices. Because U.S. payers do not require evidence on prices relative to value, U.S. data are unavailable to test whether prices are higher, relative to value, for cancer drugs than for other drugs. Evidence from the Canadian Common Drug Review on cost-utility values suggests that cancer drugs are relatively high priced, although conclusions are tentative because of very small samples and non-U.S. data. Making such outcomes-adjusted prices available in the U.S. would be helpful to physicians, payers, and patients and indirectly constrain pricing to align with value.

The monthly drug treatment costs in the USA were a median of 2·31 times (IQR 1·79-3·17) as high as in the assessed European countries. There were no significant associations between monthly treatment costs for solid tumours and clinical benefit in all assessed countries. Cancer drugs with low or uncertain clinical benefit might be prioritised for price negotiations. Value frameworks could help identify therapies providing high clinical benefit that should be made rapidly available across countries.

In this cross-sectional study, prices of brand-name medications for treatment of NSCLC increased in the US from 2015 to 2020 without evidence of price competition, raising concern about the affordability of promising oncology drugs. These findings suggest that drug pricing reform is needed.

## 38.2 Global Disparities

### The Burden of Cancer in Low- and Middle-Income Countries

Cancer has evolved from a disease primarily affecting wealthy nations to a global health challenge with disproportionate impacts on resource-limited settings. Treating a single cancer patient may require the coordination of many inputs and may cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in high-income countries (HICs), creating insurmountable barriers for most patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

The epidemiological transition in LMICs has shifted disease patterns toward non-communicable diseases, including cancer. Each year, 5 million people in low- and middle-income countries (LMCs) die from cancer, about 10 percent of the 50 million deaths in those countries. This represents a significant and growing burden that often exceeds the capacity of existing healthcare infrastructure.

Breakthroughs in our global fight against cancer have been achieved. However, this progress has been unequal. In low- and middle-income countries and for specific populations in high-income settings, many of these advancements are but an aspiration and hope for the future. The rising prevalence of noncommunicable diseases globally, with a strikingly disproportionate increase in prevalence and related mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), is a major threat to sustainable development. The epidemiologic trend of cancers in LMICs is of particular concern. Despite a lower incidence of cancer in LMICs compared with high-income countries, total cancer-related mortality is significantly higher in LMICs, especially in people younger than 65 years of age.

Cancer is rapidly becoming a major health care problem, especially in developing countries, where 60% of the world's total new cases are diagnosed. There is a projected rise in cancer cases worldwide, particularly in low-income countries where most cancer-related deaths are expected. Although the approval rate of cancer treatments has risen, their excessive cost and lack of affordability pose significant barriers to widespread access. Disparities in the costs of crucial cancer medications are influenced by geographic location.

### Healthcare Infrastructure Disparities

The availability of basic cancer care services varies dramatically between high-income and low-income countries. Less than 25% of the global population has access to basic, high-quality cancer surgery. Similarly, only 40–60% of patients with cancer are estimated to have access to radiotherapy services. These disparities in fundamental treatment modalities create profound inequities in survival outcomes.

Infrastructure limitations extend beyond specialized cancer services to encompass basic diagnostic capabilities. About 18 percent of low-income countries have recorded mortality data any time since 1950, and about 35 percent have published some population-based incidence data. This lack of basic epidemiological infrastructure hampers both clinical care and public health planning.

### Geographic and Economic Access Barriers

Geographic barriers compound economic constraints in resource-limited settings. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, and Madagascar, not having to pay for the costs of transportation reduced the proportion of patients not attending for surgery by 45%. This demonstrates how seemingly minor costs can create insurmountable barriers to essential cancer care.

The concentration of cancer services in urban centers creates additional disparities. LICs have a preponderance of Basic facilities, rural areas in MICs have more facilities with Limited capabilities, urban areas in MICs have more facilities with Enhanced capabilities, and much of the population in HICs has access to facilities with Maximal capabilities. This geographic maldistribution means that patients in rural areas face both distance and financial barriers to accessing appropriate care.

Palliative care and pain management constitute an integral part of the multi-disciplinary approach to treating patients with cancer. There are major disparities in the global presence of sustainable palliative care models and universal availability of effective pain medications, especially in low and middle income countries with the highest predicted future burden of cancer. Active intervention is needed to improve the availability of palliative care and effective pain control worldwide.

### Cancer Types and Stage Distribution

The types of cancers prevalent in different economic settings reflect varying risk factor exposures and screening capabilities. In high-income countries, breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers comprise more than 50 percent of diagnosed cancers. Middle-income countries—such as those in Latin America—have high rates of esophageal, stomach, and liver cancers. These differences reflect underlying risk factor patterns, including infectious disease burden and lifestyle factors.

Stage at diagnosis also varies significantly by resource setting. Delays in diagnosis, resulting from prolonged duration in the presentation, diagnosis, and/or treatment intervals, are often associated with education level, socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity, rural residence, and other risk factors. Later-stage diagnosis in resource-limited settings contributes to poorer outcomes and higher case fatality rates.

### Childhood Cancer Disparities

The disparities in cancer care are perhaps most stark for pediatric patients. Nonetheless, in the United States and other resource-rich countries, 75–80 percent of children with cancer survive for 5 years and most live out full lifetimes. But nearly 80 percent of the world's children who develop cancer are in resource-poor countries. Those without access to treatment, which is most in poor countries, do not survive.

This dramatic difference in outcomes reflects not only resource constraints but also the potential for effective intervention when appropriate care is available. For specific cancer types, such as childhood cancers, survival can be greater than 80% in high-resource settings and less than 20% in low-resource settings.

### Social Determinants and Vulnerable Populations

Indigenous populations face particular challenges in cancer care access globally. Despite this diversity, many Indigenous people around the world, in both high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries, continue to face substantial economic, health, and social disadvantages as a result of an enduring legacy of colonization, an ongoing marginalization and disempowerment.

These social determinants create compounding disadvantages. Indigenous people are more likely to have cancers that are largely preventable, detectable by screening, and/or have a poor prognosis, such as lung, liver, and cervical cancers. The intersection of social disadvantage, limited healthcare access, and higher-risk cancer types creates particularly challenging disparities.

### Screening and Prevention Disparities

Access to cancer screening varies dramatically by economic development level. A screening intervention can be successful only if the disease is more likely to be cured when detected early, and for which effective treatment for early-stage disease is available, affordable, and acceptable to the individual, the community, and the jurisdiction of interest.

The infrastructure requirements for effective screening programs often exceed the capacity of resource-limited settings. While these screening methods may be feasible in some settings (mainly middle-income countries), they can only be successful where a reasonable healthcare infrastructure exists and care for detected cancers can be accessed, a requirement that, unfortunately, still excludes many countries.

## 38.3 Ethical and Policy Considerations

### Ethical Frameworks in Cancer Care Economics

The intersection of economics and ethics in cancer care raises fundamental questions about justice, equity, and the allocation of scarce resources. Dr. Daniel Brock of Harvard Medical School's Division of Medical Ethics began with his description of value in cancer care and treatment: "That the benefits in life extension and improved quality of life are obtained at a reasonable cost comparable to other typically-funded treatments and at a reasonable cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)".

However, the application of cost-effectiveness criteria to cancer care raises complex ethical questions. Many cancer drugs fail to meet this standard, which is in essence a cost-effectiveness standard. This creates tension between economic efficiency and other ethical principles such as beneficence and justice.

### Equity and Priority Setting

The question of who deserves priority in resource allocation becomes particularly acute in cancer care. Adhering to the adage that one can tell the justice of a society by how it treats its least well-off members, special concern or priority is often given to those who are worst off. Does this justify spending more on cancer patients who are near death?

This ethical dilemma becomes more complex when considering age and life expectancy. Assume for a moment, Dr. Brock said, that giving cancer drugs is equivalent to providing additional months or years of life. Who are the worst off with respect to months and years of life? Different ethical frameworks may lead to different conclusions about resource allocation priorities.

### Cost-Effectiveness and Moral Considerations

The role of cost-effectiveness analysis in healthcare decision-making extends beyond economic considerations to encompass moral obligations. Cost-effectiveness is not merely an economic concern, because improving people's health and well-being is a moral concern, and an allocation of resources that is not cost-effective produces fewer benefits than would have been possible with a different allocation.

However, the application of economic evaluation methods must account for values beyond efficiency. Producing more rather than fewer benefits for people is one important ethical consideration in evaluating actions and social policies, but it is not the only consideration. Issues of equity, dignity, and respect for persons must also be incorporated into policy decisions.

Many new cancer drugs provide only limited benefits, but at very great cost, for example, $200,000-$300,000 per quality-adjusted life year produced. By most standards of value or cost-effectiveness, this does not represent good value. The cost of cancer care has increased by five fold over the last three decades. As our healthcare system shifts from volume to value, greater scrutiny of interventions with clinical equipoise is required. Traditionally, QALYs and ICER have served as surrogate markers for value. However, this approach fails to incorporate all stakeholders' viewpoints.

The principle of extended dominance is applied in incremental cost-effectiveness analysis to eliminate from consideration strategies whose costs and benefits are improved by a mixed strategy of two other alternatives. Ethical considerations arise, however, in that equal care is not provided to all of the population. The implications of cost-effectiveness analysis are made explicit, revealing classic economic concerns about the tradeoff of equity and efficiency.

### Individual Responsibility and Health Outcomes

The question of individual responsibility for health outcomes introduces additional ethical complexity. There are strong moral reasons for considerable caution in letting health resource allocation depend on individuals' responsibility for their health needs. For that practice to be fair to those whose needs receive lower priority because of behavior, (a) the needs must have been caused by the behavior, (b) the behavior must have been voluntary, and (c) the persons must have known that the behavior would cause the health needs.

The example of smoking-related cancers illustrates these complexities. Smoking shows that these conditions are not easily satisfied. Smoking is one causal factor in much cancer and heart disease, but many smokers do not get those diseases, indicating that other factors, no doubt in part genetic differences for which individuals are not responsible, also play an important causal role.

### Professional Ethics and Financial Incentives

Healthcare professionals face ethical challenges when financial incentives conflict with patient care obligations. The realistic worry, concerning which the data are not yet in, is rather that over time the increased importance of investor-owned for-profit institutions may permit considerations of economic self-interest increasingly to invade the heretofore somewhat protected sphere of the physician/patient relationship.

The potential for conflicts of interest extends beyond individual practitioners to institutional and system-level considerations. In that light, it is unnecessary to view for-profit institutions as introducing a qualitatively new dimension of commercialization and new set of conflicts of interest into health care, as financial considerations have always played a role in healthcare delivery.

### Policy Approaches to Affordability

Various policy mechanisms have been proposed to address cancer care affordability while maintaining ethical standards. Emanuel further suggested that treatment guidelines be required to rank chemotherapy by price, and recommend the least expensive treatments be used first when outcomes are similar. Such approaches attempt to balance cost considerations with clinical effectiveness.

However, implementing cost-conscious policies requires careful attention to potential unintended consequences. Emanuel also suggested supporting insurers who only pay for cancer treatments that adhere to clinical practice guidelines, standard of care, or evidence-based treatment pathways. "We don't like to say no and be the bad guy, but we need to support insurers that say no," he said.

The burden of cancer on public finances is a serious concern for policy makers. More people are developing cancer, and as standards of care have risen, more are surviving and requiring longer-term care. Precision medicine promises better outcomes but demands commensurately higher payments for care. As both incidence and per case costs rise, the task of expanding access to high-quality cancer care poses a "value challenge" that policies in many countries are inadequate to meet. Policy makers should respond with a new approach using transparency and accountability as cornerstones of a new approach to promote value-based decision making.

The 340B drug pricing program is a health care policy that may provide an opportunity to mitigate the financial consequences of cancer care. The 340B program requires manufacturers to sell outpatient drugs at a discount to hospitals caring for a significant number of socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals. However, there has been growing discussion among stakeholders to reform the 340B program given the mixed findings of its effectiveness. With the rising costs of specialty drugs and associated prevalence of financial toxicity in patients with cancer, there is an opportunity to address these issues through reform that improves the program.

### Screening Ethics and Resource Allocation

Cancer screening programs raise particular ethical considerations regarding population-level interventions. Population-wide cancer screening programs increasingly raise controversies. Many members of the public and many health professionals believe strongly that early detection saves lives — that screening fulfills the clinical duty of beneficence.

However, screening also entails potential harms and opportunity costs. Recommendations to change the intensity of screening or the population invited to screen in order to limit the harms of screening — in order to fulfill the duty of non-maleficence — can be controversial. They may be seen as motivated by cost considerations even when they are based in a clinical analysis of harms and benefits.

### Global Justice and Health Equity

The dramatic disparities in cancer care between high-income and low-income countries raise questions of global justice. Feasible, affordable, and cost-effective interventions that reduce exposure to the key causes and other risk factors for cancer and for other noncommunicable diseases, increase access to essential health-care services, and ensure the availability of effective and affordable essential medicines and vaccines are crucial for disease control globally.

Addressing these disparities requires coordinated international action. RECOMMENDATION. Countries and global partners should follow the evolving information on newer screening approaches and determine the feasibility of adoption, given local resources and infrastructure. Such recommendations recognize both the potential benefits of cancer control interventions and the need to adapt approaches to local contexts.

### Future Directions and Sustainability

The long-term sustainability of cancer care systems requires innovative approaches that balance effectiveness, affordability, and equity. The committee's recommendations aim to ensure the delivery of high-quality cancer care across the care continuum, from diagnosis through end of life.

Achieving these goals will require fundamental changes in how cancer care is organized, financed, and delivered. The committee's vision for a cancer care delivery system is one in which all people with cancer have access to high-quality, affordable cancer care. Underpinning this system are new payment models that reward cancer care teams for providing patient-centered, high-quality care and eliminating wasteful interventions.

## Conclusion

Health economics and access to cancer care represent critical challenges that require multifaceted approaches combining clinical excellence, economic efficiency, and ethical principles. As future healthcare professionals, understanding these complex interactions is essential for providing optimal patient care while advocating for systemic improvements.

The dramatic disparities in cancer outcomes between different populations and geographic regions underscore the urgent need for innovative solutions that address both immediate patient needs and long-term sustainability. Cancer has substantial economic impacts for patients, their families and/or caregivers, employers, and the health care system. However, there is only limited understanding of how economic issues can affect access to cancer care services and the receipt of high-quality cancer care. Success will require collaboration among clinicians, policymakers, patients, and communities to develop approaches that are clinically effective, economically viable, and ethically sound.

The evidence demonstrates that high-quality cancer care can be delivered cost-effectively when appropriate systems and incentives are in place. However, achieving this goal will require fundamental changes in how healthcare systems are organized, financed, and managed. Health care expenses in the United States are increasing inexorably. At the current rate of growth, it is anticipated that 20% of the gross national product will consist of health-related expenditures within the next decade. Although cancer is responsible for only 5% of the health care budget, its cost is increasing and it can be viewed as paradigmatic when contemplating the problem of equity in health care.

Value-based health care (VBHC) has recently emerged as a prominent movement within health care. Value-based health care focuses on maximizing outcomes achieved per dollar spent. As such, it bears many similarities to a well-established method, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), which provides a framework for evaluating the economic efficiency of healthcare interventions. As healthcare professionals, we have both an opportunity and an obligation to contribute to these improvements through our clinical practice, advocacy, and commitment to the principles of equity and justice in healthcare.
