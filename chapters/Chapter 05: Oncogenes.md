# Chapter 5: Oncogenes

## 5.1 Discovery of Oncogenes

The discovery of oncogenes represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in cancer biology, transforming our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer. This conceptual revolution began with research on tumor viruses and eventually led to the identification of human genes capable of driving malignant transformation when altered.

### 5.1.1 Viral Oncogenes and Retroviral Discoveries

The study of oncogenes originated from investigations into tumor-causing viruses, particularly retroviruses, which laid much of the foundation for our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor induction.

**Peyton Rous and Early Virus Discovery**

Retroviruses were first discovered in association with cancer around the turn of the 20th century. An avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) was isolated from a spontaneous erythroleukemia in a chicken in 1908, and soon after, Peyton Rous isolated Rous sarcoma virus from a chicken fibrosarcoma in 1911. These experiments demonstrated that a submicroscopic agent could cause cancer, though this concept remained controversial for decades.

**Retroviral Life Cycle and Transformation**

The first oncogenes were discovered through the study of retroviruses, RNA tumor viruses whose genomes are reverse-transcribed into DNA in infected animal cells. During the course of infection, retroviral DNA is inserted into the chromosomes of host cells. The integrated retroviral DNA, called the provirus, replicates along with the cellular DNA of the host. Transcription of the DNA provirus leads to the production of viral progeny that bud through the host cell membrane to infect other cells.

Two categories of retroviruses are classified by their time course of tumor formation in experimental animals:

- **Acutely transforming retroviruses**: Can rapidly cause tumors within days after injection and can transform cell cultures to the neoplastic phenotype
- **Chronic or weakly oncogenic retroviruses**: Cause tissue-specific tumors in susceptible strains of experimental animals after a latency period of many months

### 5.1.2 Discovery of Viral Oncogenes and Proto-oncogenes

**First Viral Oncogenes**

Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) was the first acutely transforming virus shown to have acquired its oncogenicity by the capture of a cellular gene, in this case one called src. RSV was perhaps unusual because, unlike most acutely transforming retroviruses, it retained the ability to replicate.

A more typical acutely transforming oncogene-containing retrovirus is typified by Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV). Infection resulted in the replacement of most of the viral genes with a modified copy of the protooncogene c-abl, a tyrosine kinase. Like most viral oncogenes and their cellular counterparts, the abl portion of v-abl differs genetically from c-abl.

**Discovery of Cellular Origins**

The truly revolutionary insight came when it was discovered that viral oncogenes had cellular counterparts in normal DNA. Studies revealed that v-src was not truly a viral gene but rather a captured and altered version of a normal cellular gene (c-src or cellular src). This paradigm-shifting discovery revealed that:

1. Cancer-causing genes were present in the normal cellular genome
2. These normal cellular genes (proto-oncogenes) could be activated or altered to become oncogenes
3. Retroviruses could capture these cellular genes during infection and incorporate them into their genomes

**Retroviral Transduction Process**

Retroviral oncogenes are altered versions of host cellular protooncogenes that have been incorporated into the retroviral genome by recombination with host DNA, a process known as retroviral transduction. Acutely transforming viruses usually are generated when a cellular protooncogene is captured by insertion into the viral genome during viral replication. This process usually causes genetic changes in the protooncogene, resulting in an oncogene, or dominant transforming gene.

### 5.1.3 Mechanisms of Proto-oncogene Activation

**Insertional Mutagenesis**

In contrast to acutely transforming retroviruses, weakly oncogenic retroviruses do not carry viral oncogenes. These retroviruses induce tumors by a process called insertional mutagenesis. This process results from integration of the DNA provirus into the host genome in infected cells. In rare cells, the provirus inserts near a protooncogene. Expression of the protooncogene is then abnormally driven by the transcriptional regulatory elements contained within the long terminal repeats of the provirus.

Insertion of a provirus in the vicinity of a proto-oncogene disrupts the normal organization of the locus and also introduces strong promoter and enhancer regions into the locus. The relationship of the viral and cellular sequences is usually quite flexible. Insertions can occur over a broad range upstream or downstream from many targeted loci, and the proviruses can be in the same transcriptional orientation as the gene or in the opposite orientation.

**Structural Alterations in Viral Oncogenes**

An oncogene incorporated into a retroviral genome differs in several respects from the corresponding proto-oncogene:

- The viral oncogene is transcribed under the control of viral promoter and enhancer sequences, rather than being controlled by the normal transcriptional regulatory sequences
- Oncogenes are usually expressed at much higher levels than the proto-oncogenes and are sometimes transcribed in inappropriate cell types
- Oncogenes frequently encode proteins that differ in structure and function from those encoded by their normal homologs

Many oncogenes are expressed as fusion proteins with viral sequences. Recombination events leading to the generation of such fusion proteins often occur during the capture of proto-oncogenes by retroviruses, and sequences from both the amino and carboxy termini of proto-oncogenes are frequently deleted during the process. Such deletions may result in the loss of regulatory domains that control the activity of the proto-oncogene proteins, thereby generating oncogene proteins that function in an unregulated manner.

### 5.1.4 From Viral Studies to Human Cancer

**Chromosomal Translocations as Guides**

Chromosomal translocations have served as guideposts for the discovery of many new oncogenes. The first consistent karyotypic abnormality identified in a human neoplasm was a characteristic small chromosome in the cells of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Later identified as a derivative of chromosome 22, this abnormality was designated the Philadelphia chromosome, after its city of discovery.

A proto-oncogene on chromosome 9, c-abl, the precursor to the viral oncogene in a mouse leukemia virus, was always found at the junction point in the Philadelphia chromosome, joined to another gene from chromosome 22. The abl protein made from the translocated gene in the Philadelphia chromosome was a fusion protein, encoded mostly by c-abl and partly by the adjacent gene brought in from chromosome 22.

**Human Oncogene Identification**

The first direct identification of an oncogenic mutation in a human cancer came from DNA transfection experiments. Several overactive growth-promoting genes were identified by isolating and sequencing the DNA fragments that had been transferred to transformed cells. The first of these genes to be sequenced was a mutant version of the Ras gene, which is now known to be mutated in about one in four human tumors.

## 5.2 Proto-oncogenes: Normal Cellular Functions

Proto-oncogenes encode proteins with essential roles in normal cellular processes, particularly those involved in growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Understanding proto-oncogenes provides critical insights into both normal cellular processes and the mechanisms of oncogenic transformation.

### 5.2.1 Cellular Functions of Proto-oncogenes

Proto-oncogenes play crucial roles in normal cell physiology and are involved in practically every type of molecule involved in cell signaling—secreted proteins, transmembrane receptors, GTP-binding proteins, protein kinases, gene regulatory proteins, and so on.

**Signal Transduction Components**

The majority of oncogene proteins function as elements of the signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival in response to growth factor stimulation. These oncogene proteins include:

- **Polypeptide growth factors**: That promote cell proliferation
- **Growth factor receptors**: Particularly receptor tyrosine kinases
- **Elements of intracellular signaling pathways**: Including protein kinases and GTP-binding proteins
- **Transcription factors**: That regulate gene expression

**Cell Cycle and Growth Control**

Proto-oncogenes are critical components of the pathways that regulate the social behavior of cells in the body—in particular, the mechanisms by which signals from a cell's neighbors can impel it to divide, differentiate, or die. Many cancer mutations alter signal pathway components in a way that causes them to deliver proliferative signals even when more cells are not needed, switching on cell growth, DNA replication, and cell division inappropriately.

### 5.2.2 Major Proto-oncogene Families

**Growth Factor Receptors**

A large group of oncogenes encode growth factor receptors, most of which are protein-tyrosine kinases. These receptors are frequently converted to oncogene proteins by alterations of their amino-terminal domains, which would normally bind extracellular growth factors. The action of growth factors as oncogene proteins results from their abnormal expression, leading to a situation in which a tumor cell produces a growth factor to which it also responds. The result is autocrine stimulation of the growth factor-producing cell, which drives abnormal cell proliferation.

**Signal Transduction Molecules**

Many proto-oncogenes encode intracellular signaling proteins that relay messages from growth factor receptors to the cell's nucleus. These include:

- Small GTP-binding proteins like Ras
- Protein kinases that phosphorylate other proteins
- Adaptor proteins that facilitate protein-protein interactions

**Transcriptional Regulators**

Some proto-oncogenes encode transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. When these become oncogenes, they can inappropriately activate or repress target genes.

### 5.2.3 Normal Regulation of Proto-oncogenes

Proto-oncogenes are tightly regulated under normal conditions through multiple mechanisms to ensure that cell proliferation occurs only when appropriate. This regulation includes:

- **Transcriptional control**: Regulating when and where proto-oncogenes are expressed
- **Post-translational modifications**: Controlling protein activity through phosphorylation and other modifications
- **Protein-protein interactions**: Modulating activity through binding partners
- **Subcellular localization**: Controlling where proteins function within the cell

## 5.3 Mechanisms of Oncogene Activation

The activation of oncogenes involves genetic changes to cellular protooncogenes. The consequence of these genetic alterations is to confer a growth advantage to the cell. Three genetic mechanisms activate oncogenes in human neoplasms: (1) mutation, (2) gene amplification, and (3) chromosome rearrangements.

### 5.3.1 Point Mutations

Point mutations represent a common mechanism of oncogene activation, particularly for genes encoding signaling proteins.

**RAS Mutations**

The major hot spots for activating ras mutations are all located in the regions of the protein that are near the bound guanine nucleotide, particularly in proximity to the nucleotide phosphate groups. Much of the interest in ras stems from the fact that this gene is involved in a high fraction of human cancers. Ras has been shown to be oncogenically activated by mutations in over 15% of all human tumors, and in some cancers, such as pancreatic carcinoma, the frequency is as high as 90%.

The single nucleotide changes that turned a ras proto-oncogene into an oncogene were essentially identical to changes also observed when retroviral ras oncogenes were compared with the proto-oncogenes. The K-ras gene is now known to be mutated in a vast number of human cancers, including a quarter of lung cancers, half of colon cancers, and nearly all pancreatic cancers. In virtually all cases, the responsible mutations consist of no more than a single change affecting one nucleotide in the DNA sequence.

**Other Mutation Examples**

A significant example of activating point mutations is represented by those affecting the ret protooncogene in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A syndrome (MEN2A). Germline point mutations affecting one of the cysteines located in the juxtamembrane domain of the ret receptor have been found to confer an oncogenic potential as a consequence of the ligand-independent activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor.

Davies and colleagues identified B-raf mutations in around 66% of human melanoma cell lines and primary tumors. These mutations were further shown to oncogenically activate B-raf, as determined by NIH3T3 transfection analysis.

### 5.3.2 Gene Amplification

Gene amplification refers to the expansion in copy number of a gene within the genome of a cell. Gene amplification was first discovered as a mechanism by which some tumor cell lines can acquire resistance to growth-inhibiting drugs.

**Common Amplified Oncogenes**

Studies demonstrated that three protooncogene families—myc, erb B, and ras—are amplified in a significant number of human tumors:

- About 20% to 30% of breast and ovarian cancers show c-myc amplification
- N-myc was discovered as a new member of the myc protooncogene family through its amplification in neuroblastomas
- Amplification of N-myc correlates strongly with advanced tumor stage in neuroblastoma, suggesting a role for this gene in tumor progression
- L-myc was discovered through its amplification in small-cell carcinoma of the lung
- Amplification of erb B, the epidermal growth factor receptor, is found in up to 50% of glioblastomas

### 5.3.3 Chromosomal Rearrangements

Chromosomal translocations can create oncogenic fusion proteins or place proto-oncogenes under inappropriate regulatory control.

**Fusion Oncoproteins**

The Philadelphia chromosome exemplifies how chromosomal rearrangements can create oncogenic fusion proteins. The BCR-ABL fusion protein created by the t(9;22) translocation is much more active enzymatically than the normal c-abl protein, driving leukemia development through constitutive tyrosine kinase activity.

**Enhancer Hijacking**

In the human childhood tumor called Burkitt's lymphoma, a myc gene on chromosome eight is joined to other chromosomes in a fashion that places strong signals for gene expression next to the myc gene, enhancing the production of myc RNA and protein. This represents enhancer hijacking, where the oncogene is placed under control of strong transcriptional enhancers.

## 5.4 Key Oncogene Families and Their Roles

### 5.4.1 RAS Family Oncogenes

Ras proteins are a major point of convergence in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling and are an important component of the cellular machinery necessary to transduce extracellular signals. Ras small GTP-binding proteins are membrane-bound intracellular signaling molecules that mediate a wide variety of cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

**Normal RAS Function**

Ras is one such oncogene product that helps to relay signals by acting as a switch. When receptors on the cell surface are stimulated (by a hormone, for example), Ras is switched on and transduces signals that tell the cell to grow. If the cell-surface receptor is not stimulated, Ras is not activated and so the pathway that results in cell growth is not initiated.

Ras helps to broadcast signals from the cell surface to other parts of the cell. It is often required when receptor tyrosine kinases signal to the nucleus to stimulate cell proliferation or differentiation by altering gene expression. The Ras proteins play a key role in mitogenic signaling by coupling growth factor receptors to activation of the Raf protein-serine/threonine kinase, which initiates a protein kinase cascade.

**RAS in Cancer**

In about 30% of human cancers, Ras is mutated so that it is permanently switched on, telling the cell to grow regardless of whether receptors on the cell surface are activated or not. Ras was first discovered as the hyperactive product of a mutant ras gene that promoted the development of cancer; we now know that about 30% of human tumors have a hyperactive ras mutation.

### 5.4.2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinases

Growth factors and their respective receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play pivotal roles in normal cellular functions, such as proliferation and motility, as well as in pathogenesis, including cancer.

**RTK Structure and Function**

The human genome has more than 500 protein kinases and they can be classified as (1) tyrosine, (2) serine-threonine or (3) nonspecific (both), based upon their amino acid specificity. Many protein kinases are cell surface receptors and act to initiate an intracellular pathway of activation, after the receptor is engaged by its ligand, typically a cytokine or growth factor.

The most characterized signaling pathways induced upon activation of RTKs, including members of EGFR family (ErbB/HER), are the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras-MAPK), the phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-PKB/Akt), and the phospholipase C-protein kinase C (PLC-PKC) pathways.

**RTK Oncogenes**

These receptors are frequently converted to oncogene proteins by alterations that result in constitutive activation. For example:

- The Tel sequences of Tel/PDGFR fusion protein dimerize in the absence of growth factor binding, resulting in constitutive activity of the intracellular kinase domain
- Genes that encode some receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, such as erbB-2, are activated by gene amplification
- Most commonly, v-onc genes that encode receptor PTKs have lost the sequences that encode some or all of the ligand-binding region of the proteins, rendering the kinases constitutively active

### 5.4.3 Non-Receptor Tyrosine Kinases

Other oncogenes encode nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases that are constitutively activated by deletions or mutations of regulatory sequences.

**ABL Family**

The abl oncogene exemplifies non-receptor tyrosine kinases. In normal cells, c-Abl is tightly regulated, but in the BCR-ABL fusion protein found in chronic myeloid leukemia, this regulation is lost, leading to constitutive kinase activity. The initial tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for use was imatinib (Gleevec: 2001) which is used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has a mutated kinase receptor (BCR-ABL) created by the specific translocation.

### 5.4.4 Transcription Factor Oncogenes

**MYC Family**

Proto-oncogenes called Harvey-Ras (H-ras) and Kirsten-Ras (K-ras) are the progenitors of viral oncogenes found in mouse and rat sarcoma viruses. The MYC family represents another major class of oncogenes that function as transcription factors, regulating the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, metabolism, and growth.

**Activation Mechanisms**

In another childhood tumor, called neuroblastoma, a different member of the myc gene family was often reduplicated ("amplified"), so that many copies of the gene and dangerously large amounts of myc protein were made in the cancer cells.

## 5.5 Clinical Implications and Therapeutic Targeting

### 5.5.1 Oncogenes as Drug Targets

The discovery that many oncogenes encode altered protein kinases has led to the development of targeted therapies. Protein kinases can be specifically involved in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation and mutations may lead to unregulated growth and proliferation that is typical of cancerous cells. These mutated protein kinases represent an attractive target for anticancer agents.

**Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors**

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are a group of pharmacologic agents that disrupt the signal transduction pathways of protein kinases by several modes of inhibition. Interest in protein kinase inhibitors began with the FDA approval of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib in 2001. Since the introduction of Imatinib, the application of TKIs has been ever-expanding, particularly for cancer treatment.

The potent activity and lack of generalized toxicity of the kinase inhibitors relate to the specificity of antagonist for the mutated protein. The protein kinase inhibitors represent a major advance in cancer chemotherapy, away from broadly cytotoxic agents and towards drugs that specifically target the molecular abnormalities of cancer cells.

### 5.5.2 Resistance Mechanisms

Despite their effectiveness, targeted therapies face challenges from resistance mechanisms:

- Patients require monitoring for disease progression after the initial benefit, which could be a sign of acquired resistance
- Genetic testing to identify known resistance mutations can help guide genotype-directed therapy
- The toxicity and efficacy of TKIs are often closely linked; this allows on-target toxic effects to act as biomarkers of effective pharmacological inhibition

### 5.5.3 Future Directions

The continuing identification of new oncogenes and their mechanisms of activation provides opportunities for developing additional targeted therapies. Usually, a single oncogene is not enough to turn a normal cell into a cancer cell, and many mutations in a number of different genes may be required to make a cell cancerous. Understanding oncogene cooperation and the networks they participate in will be crucial for developing more effective combination therapies.

## Conclusion

The discovery of oncogenes has revolutionized our understanding of cancer biology. From the initial observations of tumor viruses to the identification of mutated genes in human cancers, oncogenes have provided crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms driving malignant transformation.

Cancer results from alterations in critical regulatory genes that control cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The viral and cellular oncogenes have defined a large group of genes (about 100 in total) that can contribute to the abnormal behavior of malignant cells. As noted, many of the proteins encoded by proto-oncogenes regulate normal cell proliferation; in these cases, the elevated expression or activity of the corresponding oncogene proteins drives the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells.

The study of oncogenes has not only enhanced our fundamental understanding of cancer but has also led to the development of targeted therapies that have transformed cancer treatment. The success of drugs like imatinib in treating BCR-ABL-positive leukemias represents one of the first and most dramatic examples of effective targeted therapy in oncology, demonstrating the clinical value of understanding oncogene biology.

As our knowledge of oncogenes continues to expand through genomic technologies and functional studies, new opportunities for therapeutic intervention continue to emerge. The challenge now is to translate this growing understanding into more effective treatments for the many patients whose cancers are driven by oncogenic alterations.
