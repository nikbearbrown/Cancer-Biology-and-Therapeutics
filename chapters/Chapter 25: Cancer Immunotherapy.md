# Chapter 25: Cancer Immunotherapy

## 25.1 Fundamentals of Cancer Immunology

The relationship between the immune system and cancer has evolved into one of the most significant therapeutic frontiers in modern oncology. Evidence accumulated over recent decades indicates that the host immune system actively interacts with developing tumors and, in specific circumstances, can arrest tumor growth and induce regression.

### 25.1.1 The Immune System and Tumor Recognition

The fundamental premise of cancer immunotherapy rests on the ability of the immune system to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. In experimental animal models, tumors induced by carcinogens or oncogenic viruses express unique tumor-associated transplantation antigens (TATAs), demonstrating that the immune system can distinguish between normal and transformed cells. When animals are immunized with killed tumor cells, they develop long-lasting, specific antitumor immunity that enables them to reject subsequent challenges with viable tumor cells.

In human cancer patients, the presence of antibodies to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and specific effector cells in peripheral circulation has been extensively documented. This implies that immune cells potentially capable of tumor rejection exist in cancer patients. Various effector mechanisms have been identified:

* **T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity**: Tumor-specific T cells recognize antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
* **Natural killer (NK) cell activity**: Innate immune cells capable of recognizing and eliminating abnormal cells
* **Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)**: Antibody-armed immune cells targeting tumor cells
* **Macrophage-mediated killing**: Activated macrophages capable of tumor cell destruction

### 25.1.2 Immune Surveillance and Escape Mechanisms

Despite the presence of antitumor immune responses, cancers frequently progress, indicating that tumors have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade immune recognition—a phenomenon termed "immunologic escape." Several key mechanisms contribute to immune evasion:

**Antigen Loss or Presentation Defects**
* Loss of tumor-associated antigens through genetic mutations
* Defects in antigen processing machinery
* Downregulation of MHC Class I molecules
* Mutations in β2-microglobulin affecting MHC presentation

**Immunosuppressive Microenvironment**
* Production of immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF-β, IL-10)
* Expression of immune checkpoint molecules
* Recruitment of regulatory immune cells
* Metabolic barriers to T-cell function

**T-cell Dysfunction and Exhaustion**
* Chronic antigen stimulation leading to T-cell exhaustion
* Upregulation of inhibitory receptors
* Loss of effector function and proliferative capacity

## 25.2 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors

Immune checkpoint inhibitors represent one of the most significant advances in cancer immunotherapy. These molecules normally function as critical control mechanisms to prevent excessive immune activation and autoimmunity, but cancer cells exploit these pathways to evade immune destruction.

### 25.2.1 CTLA-4 Pathway and Inhibition

**Molecular Mechanism of CTLA-4**

Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily with structural homology to the co-stimulatory receptor CD28. CTLA-4 plays a crucial role in immune regulation through several mechanisms:

* **Competitive inhibition**: CTLA-4 binds to B7 ligands (CD80 and CD86) on antigen-presenting cells with higher affinity than CD28, preventing co-stimulatory signaling
* **Ligand capture**: CTLA-4-expressing cells capture and degrade CD80 and CD86 from APC surfaces
* **Cell cycle arrest**: CTLA-4 signaling inhibits IL-2 production and blocks T-cell progression through the cell cycle

CTLA-4 expression is tightly regulated and activation-dependent. Unlike CD28, which is constitutively expressed, CTLA-4 is absent from naive T-cells and only appears following activation, with transcripts detectable within 1 hour and surface expression occurring 24-48 hours post-stimulation. The level of CTLA-4 expression is directly proportional to the strength of T-cell stimulation, establishing a negative feedback mechanism.

**Clinical Development of CTLA-4 Inhibitors**

**Ipilimumab** is a fully human monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 isotype that blocks CTLA-4 from interacting with its ligands. The clinical development of ipilimumab in melanoma has established several important principles:

*Phase III Clinical Results*:
* In previously treated metastatic melanoma: overall survival improved to 10.1 months with ipilimumab versus 6.4 months with control
* First-line therapy combined with dacarbazine: median overall survival of 11.2 months versus 9.1 months with placebo
* Adjuvant therapy in Stage III melanoma: 5-year recurrence-free survival improved to 40.8% versus 30.3% with placebo

*Response Characteristics*:
* Overall response rates: 10.9-15.2% as monotherapy
* Durable responses: plateau in survival curves at 22% at 3 years
* Long-term benefit in responding patients

### 25.2.2 PD-1/PD-L1 Pathway and Inhibition

**Molecular Mechanism of PD-1**

Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) represents a distinct immune checkpoint with different temporal and spatial functions compared to CTLA-4. Key features include:

* **Signal transduction**: Contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and switch motif (ITSM) that recruit phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2
* **TCR signal dampening**: Directly inhibits T-cell receptor signaling rather than competing for co-stimulation
* **Peripheral tolerance**: Functions primarily in peripheral tissues during the effector phase of immune responses
* **Ligand interactions**: Binds to PD-L1 (broadly expressed) and PD-L2 (more restricted expression)

PD-1 expression patterns differ significantly from CTLA-4:
* Absent on resting T-cells, upregulated following activation
* High expression during chronic stimulation (viral infections, cancer)
* Associated with T-cell exhaustion phenotype
* Expression correlates with tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte dysfunction

**PD-L1 Expression and Tumor Immune Escape**

PD-L1 expression serves as an adaptive immune resistance mechanism:
* Constitutively expressed on various immune and non-immune cells
* Upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN-γ
* Frequently overexpressed on tumor cells
* Located in proximity to CD8+ T-cell infiltrates
* Creates a localized immunosuppressive environment

**Clinical Development of PD-1 Inhibitors**

**Nivolumab** and **Pembrolizumab** are fully human monoclonal antibodies of the IgG4 isotype targeting PD-1:

*Clinical Efficacy*:
* Previously treated melanoma: 31.7% objective response rate with nivolumab versus 10.7% with chemotherapy
* First-line wild-type BRAF melanoma: 1-year overall survival 72.9% versus 42.1% with dacarbazine
* Pembrolizumab first-line: 1-year overall survival 74.1% versus 58.2% with ipilimumab

*Safety Profile*:
* Lower incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse events compared to CTLA-4 inhibitors
* Common adverse events: fatigue, rash, diarrhea, pruritus, nausea
* Improved tolerability allows for longer treatment durations

### 25.2.3 Combination Immune Checkpoint Inhibition

The distinct mechanisms and timing of CTLA-4 and PD-1 provide rationale for combination therapy:

**Mechanistic Rationale**:
* CTLA-4 affects T-cell priming phase
* PD-1 impacts effector phase in peripheral tissues
* Non-overlapping pathways may provide synergistic benefit

**Clinical Results**:
* Combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab: 57.6% objective response rate
* Median progression-free survival: 11.5 months versus 6.9 months (nivolumab alone) or 2.9 months (ipilimumab alone)
* Enhanced efficacy comes with increased toxicity: 55.5% Grade 3-4 adverse events

## 25.3 CAR T-cell Therapy and Other Adoptive Cell Therapies

### 25.3.1 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell Therapy

**CAR Design and Function**

Chimeric antigen receptors are recombinant receptors that redirect T-lymphocyte specificity and function in a single engineered molecule. The concept leverages several advantages:

* **Rapid deployment**: Bypasses barriers and kinetics of active immunization
* **Homogeneous targeting**: Programmed to target specific tumor-associated antigens
* **Enhanced potency**: Supraphysiologic activities compared to natural T-cells
* **Persistence**: Designed to maintain long-term surveillance

**CAR Structure and Components**:
* **Extracellular domain**: Recognizes specific tumor antigen (often derived from monoclonal antibodies)
* **Transmembrane domain**: Anchors the receptor in the cell membrane
* **Intracellular signaling domains**: 
  - CD3 zeta: Critical for T-cell activation and anti-tumor activity
  - Co-stimulatory domains (4-1BB/CD137): Enhance expansion and persistence

**FDA-Approved CAR T-cell Products**

**Tisagenlecleucel**: CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy
* Target: B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
* Design: Murine single-chain antibody fragment fused to 4-1BB and CD3 zeta domains
* Mechanism: Binds CD19-expressing cells, transmits activation signal, promotes T-cell expansion and target elimination

**Axicabtagene ciloleucel**: CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy
* Similar mechanism targeting CD19-expressing malignancies
* Different co-stimulatory domain configuration

### 25.3.2 CAR T-cell Therapy Process

**Manufacturing Process**:
1. **Leukapheresis**: Collection of patient's peripheral blood T-cells
2. **Genetic modification**: Introduction of CAR transgene using viral vectors
3. **Ex vivo expansion**: Proliferation of CAR-expressing T-cells in laboratory
4. **Quality control**: Testing for identity, purity, potency, and safety
5. **Cryopreservation**: Freezing and storage until patient ready for infusion
6. **Reinfusion**: Administration of CAR T-cells to patient

**Clinical Considerations**:
* **Patient preparation**: Lymphodepleting chemotherapy to enhance CAR T-cell engraftment
* **Monitoring**: Close observation for cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity
* **Supportive care**: Management of complications and side effects

### 25.3.3 Expanding CAR T-cell Targets

Beyond CD19-targeting in B-cell malignancies, numerous tumor-associated antigens are under investigation for CAR T-cell therapy:

**Hematologic Malignancies**:

* Reinfusion with supportive cytokines

**Advantages**:
* Uses naturally occurring tumor-specific T-cells
* Polyclonal response against multiple antigens
* Proven clinical efficacy in melanoma

## 25.4 Cancer Vaccines

Cancer vaccines aim to stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells through active immunization strategies. Two major categories exist: prophylactic vaccines to prevent cancer development and therapeutic vaccines to treat existing cancers.

### 25.4.1 Targets for Cancer Vaccine Therapy

Vaccine targets can be categorized into tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) and tumor-associated antigens (TAAs):

**Tumor-Specific Antigens (TSAs)**:
TSAs comprise gene products uniquely expressed in tumors:

* **Mutated oncogenes**: Point-mutated ras oncogenes (found in 20-30% of human tumors)
* **Mutated tumor suppressors**: p53 mutations (though vast heterogeneity requires individualized approaches)
* **Fusion proteins**: Products of chromosomal translocations (bcr/abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia)
* **Splice variants**: Abnormal RNA processing products
* **Immunoglobulin idiotypes**: Unique surface proteins on B-cell lymphomas

*Advantages of TSAs*:
- Exquisitely tumor-specific
- No expression in normal tissues
- Unlikely to cause autoimmunity

*Challenges with TSAs*:
- Individual patient/tumor specificity may require personalized vaccines
- Variable expression levels may be insufficient for immune targeting
- May be lost during tumor progression

**Tumor-Associated Antigens (TAAs)**:
TAAs are overexpressed in tumors but may also be present in normal tissues:

*Oncofetal Antigens*:
* Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
* MUC-1 (breast cancer mucin)
* Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)
* Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)

*Tissue-Lineage Antigens*:
* Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
* Melanocyte antigens: MART-1/Melan A, tyrosinase, gp100, TRP-1

*Oncogene Products*:
* Non-mutated HER-2/neu
* Overexpressed p53
* Telomerase components

*Viral Antigens*:
* Human papillomavirus (HPV) proteins - cervical cancer
* Hepatitis B virus proteins - hepatocellular carcinoma
* Epstein-Barr virus proteins - certain lymphomas

### 25.4.2 Prophylactic Cancer Vaccines

**HPV Vaccines**:
The most successful cancer vaccine to date targets human papillomavirus:

* **Clinical impact**: Dramatic reduction in cervical cancer incidence in vaccinated populations

**Hepatitis B Vaccine**:
* **Target**: Hepatitis B surface antigen
* **Cancer prevention**: Hepatocellular carcinoma
* **Mechanism**: Prevents chronic HBV infection, a major risk factor for liver cancer
* **Impact**: Significant reduction in hepatocellular carcinoma incidence in vaccinated populations

### 25.4.3 Therapeutic Cancer Vaccines

Therapeutic vaccines face greater challenges than prophylactic vaccines due to:
* Established tumors with immune escape mechanisms
* Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment
* Tumor heterogeneity and antigen loss variants
* Host immune dysfunction in cancer patients

**Clinical Challenges**:
Recent vaccination-based clinical trials have frequently failed to demonstrate clear relationships between clinical responses and immune responses. Common issues include:
* Weak or undetectable immune responses to vaccines

* Limited correlation between immunological and clinical endpoints

**Vaccine Platforms Under Investigation**:
* Peptide vaccines
* Protein vaccines
* DNA vaccines
* RNA vaccines
* Viral vector vaccines
* Dendritic cell vaccines
* Tumor cell vaccines

## 25.5 Cytokine Therapy

Cytokines serve as crucial mediators of immune responses and have been explored extensively as cancer immunotherapeutics. These signaling proteins can modulate immune cell function, enhance tumor recognition, and promote antitumor immunity.

### 25.5.1 Interferons

**Interferon-α (IFN-α)**:
* **Mechanism**: Enhances NK cell activity, increases MHC Class I expression, promotes T-cell activation
* **Clinical applications**: Hairy cell leukemia, melanoma (adjuvant therapy), renal cell carcinoma
* **Efficacy**: Established clinical benefit in hematologic malignancies
* **Toxicity**: Flu-like symptoms, fatigue, depression, autoimmune disorders

**Interferon-β (IFN-β)**:
* **Applications**: Limited use in certain malignancies
* **Mechanism**: Similar to IFN-α but with different potency and toxicity profile

**Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)**:
* **Mechanism**: Potent activator of macrophages and NK cells, enhances antigen presentation
* **Clinical use**: Limited due to significant toxicity
* **Research applications**: Combination with other immunotherapies

### 25.5.2 Interleukin-2 (IL-2)

**High-dose IL-2**:
* **Mechanism**: Promotes T-cell and NK cell activation, expansion, and effector function
* **Clinical applications**: Metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma
* **Efficacy**: 10-20% durable complete response rates
* **Toxicity**: Severe capillary leak syndrome, multi-organ dysfunction

**Low-dose IL-2**:
* **Rationale**: Potentially enhances regulatory T-cell function

**Interleukin-12 (IL-12)**:
* **Mechanism**: Promotes Th1 immune responses, enhances T-cell and NK cell function
* **Clinical development**: Limited by toxicity in early trials
* **Current status**: Investigation in combination approaches and modified delivery systems

**Interleukin-15 (IL-15)**:
* **Advantages**: Similar to IL-2 but potentially better safety profile
* **Mechanism**: T-cell and NK cell stimulation without preferential Treg activation
* **Clinical status**: Early-phase trials ongoing

## 25.6 Immune-Related Adverse Events

The activation of immune responses through cancer immunotherapy inevitably carries the risk of autoimmune toxicity. Understanding, monitoring, and managing immune-related adverse events (irAEs) is crucial for the safe implementation of immunotherapy.

### 25.6.1 Pathophysiology of Immune-Related Adverse Events

**Mechanism of irAEs**:
* **Loss of tolerance**: Immune activation against shared antigens between tumors and normal tissues
* **Bystander effects**: Non-specific immune activation affecting normal organs
* **Cross-reactivity**: Immune responses to tumor antigens that cross-react with normal tissue antigens
* **Enhanced autoimmunity**: Unmasking or exacerbation of pre-existing autoimmune tendencies

**Factors influencing irAE development**:
* Type and dose of immunotherapy
* Duration of treatment
* Combination therapies
* Individual patient susceptibility
* Pre-existing autoimmune conditions

### 25.6.2 Clinical Spectrum of Immune-Related Adverse Events

**Dermatologic irAEs**:
* **Manifestations**: Rash, pruritus, dermatitis, vitiligo
* **Frequency**: Most common irAE category
* **Severity**: Usually Grade 1-2, occasionally severe
* **Management**: Topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids for severe cases

**Neurologic irAEs**:
* **Manifestations**: Peripheral neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome
* **Frequency**: Less common but potentially severe
* **Management**: Corticosteroids, specialized neurologic care

### 25.6.3 Monitoring and Management Strategies

**Baseline Assessment**:
* Medical history including autoimmune disorders
* Complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel
* Liver function tests, thyroid function tests
* Pulmonary function if indicated

**Regular Monitoring**:
* Laboratory assessments every 2-4 weeks initially
* Symptom assessment at each visit
* Patient education on warning signs
* Prompt evaluation of new symptoms

**Management Principles**:

* Continue immunotherapy with increased monitoring
* Symptomatic treatment
* Close follow-up

*Grade 2 (Moderate)*:
* Consider treatment interruption
* Systemic corticosteroids (0.5-1 mg/kg prednisone equivalent)
* Organ-specific interventions

*Grade 3-4 (Severe/Life-threatening)*:
* Immediate treatment discontinuation
* High-dose corticosteroids (1-2 mg/kg prednisone equivalent)
* Consider additional immunosuppression if steroid-refractory
* Hospitalization may be required

**Treatment Resumption**:
* Complete or near-complete resolution of irAE
* Steroid taper to ≤10 mg daily prednisone equivalent
* Careful risk-benefit assessment
* Enhanced monitoring

### 25.6.4 Special Considerations

**Corticosteroid Use**:
* Does not appear to diminish anti-tumor efficacy
* Gradual taper essential to prevent rebound
* Monitoring for steroid-related complications

**Combination Therapy irAEs**:
* Higher frequency and severity with CTLA-4 plus PD-1 combinations
* 55.5% Grade 3-4 adverse events versus 16.3% (nivolumab) or 27.3% (ipilimumab) alone
* Requires experienced management teams

**Long-term Sequelae**:
* Some endocrine irAEs may be permanent (thyroid dysfunction, diabetes)
* Long-term monitoring and management required
* Impact on quality of life considerations

The successful implementation of cancer immunotherapy requires a comprehensive understanding of both therapeutic potential and toxicity management. The balance between efficacy and safety continues to evolve as clinical experience expands and new combination strategies are developed. Healthcare teams must be prepared to recognize, monitor, and manage the spectrum of immune-related adverse events while maximizing the therapeutic benefit of these revolutionary cancer treatments.
