# Chapter 12: Angiogenesis

## 12.1 Introduction and Basic Concepts

Angiogenesis, the growth of new capillary blood vessels, is central to the growth of cancer. An understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of tumor angiogenesis is therefore important for clinicians who diagnose and treat cancer by whatever modalities. Angiogenesis is the growth of blood vessels from the existing vasculature. It occurs throughout life in both health and disease, beginning in utero and continuing on through old age. No metabolically active tissue in the body is more than a few hundred micrometers from a blood capillary, which is formed by the process of angiogenesis.

### 12.1.1 The Angiogenic Switch

Consider a cancer cell that has progressed through a series of mutations so that by activation of certain oncogenes and by loss of specific suppressor genes, it has become self-sufficient in growth signals, insensitive to antigrowth signals, unresponsive to apoptotic signals, capable of limitless replicative potential, and tumorigenic. Are these neoplastic properties necessary and sufficient for such a cell to expand into a population that is clinically detectable, symptomatic, or lethal? Current evidence argues that these neoplastic properties may only be necessary but not sufficient for the cancer cell to become metastatic and lethal.

The reported studies suggest that the microvascular endothelial cell dictates to a cancer cell whether it can grow a tumor to a clinically detectable size, metastasize, or kill its host. For a tumor to develop a metastatic or a lethal phenotype, it must first recruit and sustain its own private blood supply, a process called tumor angiogenesis. Tumors unable to induce angiogenesis remain dormant at a microscopic in situ size.

### 12.1.2 Normal versus Pathological Angiogenesis

Angiogenesis is fundamental to reproduction, development, and repair. In the adult, repair and reproductive angiogenesis occur mainly as brief bursts of capillary blood vessel growth that usually last only days or weeks. Such physiologic angiogenesis, including neovascularization in exercised muscle, is tightly regulated.

Capillaries grow and regress in healthy tissues according to functional demands. Exercise stimulates angiogenesis in skeletal muscle and heart. A lack of exercise leads to capillary regression. Capillaries grow in adipose tissue during weight gain and regress during weight loss. Clearly, angiogenesis occurs throughout life.

A variety of circulating and sequestered inhibitors suppress proliferation of vascular endothelium under normal conditions. As a result, endothelial cells are among the most quiescent cells of the body. Turnover times of endothelial cells are measured in hundreds of days in contrast to bone marrow cells, which maintain an average turnover time of 5 days and proliferate at approximately 6 billion cell divisions per hour. During angiogenesis, microvascular endothelial cells can proliferate as rapidly as bone marrow cells.

A hallmark of pathologic angiogenesis is persistent growth of blood vessels (i.e., sustained neovascularization). Angiogenesis that continues for months or years supports the progression of many neoplastic and nonneoplastic diseases.

### 12.1.3 Tumor Size Limitations and the Angiogenic Switch

The size limits of experimental tumors when angiogenesis is blocked or absent are between approximately 0.2 mm diameter (e.g., for lung metastases in mice) and 2 mm (e.g., for vascular chondrosarcomas in rats, having a tumor population of 10⁵–10⁶ cells). The differences in size of avascular preangiogenic tumors may be due in part to the capacity of tumor cells to survive under differing degrees of hypoxia.

Angiogenesis is needed to support the growth of a tumor beyond the size of about a million cells, at which point new blood vessels are required to supply oxygen and nutrients to the proliferating tumor cells. Such blood vessels are formed in response to growth factors, secreted by the tumor cells, that stimulate proliferation of endothelial cells in the walls of capillaries.

## 12.2 Key Angiogenic Factors

### 12.2.1 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)

Most types of parenchymal cells (myocytes, hepatocytes, neurons, astrocytes, etc.) respond to a hypoxic environment by secreting a key proangiogenic growth factor called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). There does not appear to be redundant growth factor mechanisms that can replace the role of VEGF-A in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis.

#### VEGF Structure and Isoforms

The VEGF family molecules include VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and placental growth factor (PlGF). The VEGF family of receptors consists of three protein-tyrosine kinases: VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1, Flt-1), VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2, Flk-1/KDR), VEGFR-3, and two non-protein kinase co-receptors: neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2, respectively.

VEGF-B is widely expressed, most prominently in heart and skeletal muscle, but also in mouse and human brain. The highest levels of VEGF-B in the brain are detected in neuronal-like cells of the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. VEGF-B is implicated in angiogenesis by its role in the regulation of extracellular matrix degradation, cell adhesion and migration of endothelial cells.

VEGF-C is a ligand for both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. VEGF-C mRNA is found in several tissues including heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine, although it is undetectable in the normal brain. As VEGFR-3 is the main receptor for VEGF-C and is predominantly expressed on lymphatic endothelium, VEGF-C was therefore considered to be the prototypic lymphangiogenic factor. However, VEGF-C has also been shown to act on vascular endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo.

The secreted PlGF shows a strong structural homology to VEGF and exists as three isoforms, PlGF-1, PlGF-2 and PlGF-3, which result from alternative splicing from a single gene locus. PlGF is predominantly expressed in placenta and binds exclusively to VEGFR-1. PlGF induces both proliferation and chemotaxis of endothelial cells in vitro and is angiogenic in vivo.

#### VEGF Receptors and Signaling

The VEGF family and its receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) have long been implicated as a central figure in the regulation of angiogenesis. VEGF-A directly stimulates EC proliferation by engaging with the VEGFR-2 to activate tyrosine kinase and initiate the sprouting of new vessels from existing microvessels.

VEGF also diminishes the intensity of the endothelial cell–cell interactions in the angiogenic sprout by promoting the phosphorylation and internalization of VE-cadherin. The weakened cell–cell adhesion enables tip cells to depart from the endothelial lining and also accounts for the increased vascular permeability that is characteristic of proliferating blood vessels. While most of the angiogenic effects of VEGF are mediated through VEGFR-2, the hyperpermeability associated with this process requires the activation of both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2.

### 12.2.2 Angiopoietin-Tie System

#### Tie Receptors and Angiopoietin Ligands

The tyrosine kinase receptor Tie2 was initially identified as a specific vascular growth factor that governed several properties of endothelial cells under both physiological and pathological conditions. It was subsequently found that angiopoietins, the natural ligands of Tie2, modulate Tie2-dependent signaling, which in turn regulates the survival and apoptosis of endothelial cells, controls vascular permeability, and regulates the capillary sprouting that occurs during normal angiogenesis such as through development and ovarian remodeling.

The most extensively studied Tie2 ligands are Angiopoietin 1 and 2 (Ang1, Ang2). Ang1 plays a critical role in vessel maturation, endothelial cell migration, and survival. Ang2, depending on the context, may function to disrupt connections between the endothelial cells and perivascular cells, promoting vascular regression. However, in the presence of VEGF-A, Ang2 instead promotes angiogenesis.

#### Angiopoietin Functions in Angiogenesis

Angiopoietin (Ang) 1 is a ligand for endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine kinase Tie-2. In adult vasculature, Ang1/Tie2 signaling is thought to regulate both maintenance of vascular quiescence and promotion of angiogenesis. Ang1 assembles distinct Tie2 signaling complexes in either presence or absence of endothelial cell-cell adhesions. Ang1 induces trans-association of Tie2 at cell-cell contacts, whereas Tie2 is anchored to the extracellular matrix (ECM) by Ang1 at the cell-substratum interface.

Angiopoietin-2 (ANG2), a ligand of the TIE2 receptor, modulates endothelial cell biology and destabilizes blood vessels to facilitate angiogenesis. Recent reports have shown that ANG2 inhibition, for example, by monoclonal antibodies, peptibodies, or CovX-Bodies, may achieve substantial antiangiogenic and antitumor responses in a variety of mouse tumor models.

The angiopoietins Ang1 (ANGPT1) and Ang2 (ANGPT2) are secreted factors that bind to the endothelial cell-specific receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 (TEK) and regulate angiogenesis. Ang1 activates Tie2 to promote blood vessel maturation and stabilization. In contrast, Ang2, which is highly expressed by tumor-associated endothelium, can function as either an agonist or antagonist of Tie2 signaling, depending on the cellular context.

### 12.2.3 Other Angiogenic Factors

#### Fibroblast Growth Factors

Systemic administration of IFN-α reduces tumor cell growth in IFN-sensitive cells by directly regulating the expression of the angiogenic protein basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). IFN-α and IFN-β also downregulate bFGF in other human carcinomas. Interruption of the angiogenic signal by IFNs precedes the antiproliferative effect and is detectable between 24 to 48 h after tumor inoculation.

#### Placental Growth Factor

Transplantation of wild-type bone marrow rescued the impaired angiogenesis and collateral growth in PlGF −/− mice, indicating that PlGF might have contributed to vessel growth in the adult by mobilizing bone-marrow-derived cells. PlGF has been proposed to stimulate angiogenesis by displacing VEGF from the "VEGFR-1 sink," thereby increasing the fraction of VEGF available to activate VEGFR-2. Alternatively, PlGF might stimulate angiogenesis by transmitting intracellular signals through VEGFR-1.

## 12.3 Role of Hypoxia in Angiogenesis

### 12.3.1 Hypoxia as an Angiogenic Stimulus

Sprouting angiogenesis is initiated in poorly perfused tissues when oxygen sensing mechanisms detect a level of hypoxia that demands the formation of new blood vessels to satisfy the metabolic requirements of parenchymal cells.

VEGF is up-regulated by hypoxia and is often elevated near areas of tumor necrosis. Hypoxia activates a hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)-binding sequence in the VEGF promoter, which leads to VEGF mRNA transcription and stability.

### 12.3.2 Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs)

Hypoxia triggers a unique gene transcription program (specific set of genes) through the activation of multiple transcriptional factors known as the hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs exists as a heterodimeric complex containing one of three α subunits (HIF-1α, HIF-2α, or HIF-3α) associated with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), also known as HIF 1β. Although the hypoxic response requires HIF multiple subunits to be functional, hypoxia only leads to changes in both the accumulation and the activity of the HIF-1α subunit.

Following the prolyl hydroxylase inhibition, HIF-1α is stabilized, accumulates in the cells, where it dimerizes with ARNT and translocates into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the HIF-1α/ARNT complex binds to the hypoxia responsive element (HRE) present in the promoter region of target genes as well as transcriptional co-activator (p300) and initiates the transactivation of HIF-responsive genes, including the glucose transporter Glut1 and angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Under normal physiological conditions, oxygen inhibits neovascularization by promoting the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) proteins. However, this degradation is suppressed in hypoxic environments, allowing HIF proteins to bind to VEGF DNA and enhance protein translation. This dysregulation makes hypoxia a powerful stimulus for angiogenesis.

### 12.3.3 HIF-Mediated Effects on Tumor Biology

Mutations within cancer cells upregulate angiogenic factors, leading to a disorganized and defective vascular network that further exacerbates intratumor hypoxia. Additionally, the rapid proliferation of tumor cells and blood vessels disrupts the basement membrane, increasing the risk of invasion and metastasis. Tumor hypoxia is associated with more aggressive malignant behavior and reduced survival across multiple cancer types.

## 12.4 Angiogenic Process and Stages

### 12.4.1 Basic Steps of Angiogenesis

The basic steps of sprouting angiogenesis include enzymatic degradation of capillary basement membrane, endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, directed migration of ECs, tubulogenesis (EC tube formation), vessel fusion, vessel pruning, and pericyte stabilization.

ECs exposed to such stimuli first detach from each other through alterations in adherens junction complexes, and metalloproteinases are then released to degrade the underlying basement membrane and surrounding structural elements. Hence, the initiation of angiogenesis is often associated with an increased capillary permeability that serves to enrich the adjacent interstitial compartment with plasma components.

### 12.4.2 Endothelial Cell Sprouting

Upon destabilization of the endothelial cell monolayer, the cells then migrate (haptotaxis) toward the angiogenic stimulus within the extravascular space via integrin (αvβ3, αvβ5)-mediated adhesion to matrix proteins, with a concomitant proliferation. Sprouting requires the destabilization of existing microvessels, which includes pericyte dropout, diminished cell–cell adhesion, and dissolution of the basement membrane. This process begins with an endothelial ("tip") cell leaving the endothelial monolayer, penetrating the basement membrane, and invading the adjacent interstitial compartment.

### 12.4.3 Tip Cell and Stalk Cell Specification

The cellular actions of VEGF need to be coordinated to guide vascular patterning during sprouting angiogenesis. Individual endothelial tip cells lead and guide the blood vessel sprout, while neighbouring stalk cells proliferate and form the vascular lumen. Recent studies illustrate how endothelial DLL4/NOTCH signalling, stimulated by VEGF, regulates the sprouting response by limiting tip cell formation in the stalk.

Clearly both types of endothelial cells are stimulated by the same growth factor, VEGF, and both respond through KDR signaling, yet their behaviour is very different. One of the genes induced by VEGF is the NOTCH ligand DLL4. In situ hybridization suggested that Dll4 expression is restricted to developing arteries and the tips of vascular sprouts.

### 12.4.4 Types of Angiogenesis

Sprouting angiogenesis and intussusceptive angiogenesis both occur in utero and in adults. Sprouting angiogenesis is better understood having been discovered nearly 200 years ago: intussusceptive angiogenesis was discovered by Burri about two decades ago. As implied by its name, sprouting angiogenesis is characterized by sprouts composed of endothelial cells, which usually grow toward an angiogenic stimulus such as VEGF-A. Sprouting angiogenesis can therefore add blood vessels to portions of tissues previously devoid of blood vessels.

On the other hand, intussusceptive angiogenesis involves formation of blood vessels by a splitting process in which elements of interstitial tissues invade existing vessels, forming transvascular tissue pillars that expand. Both types of angiogenesis are thought to occur in virtually all tissues and organs.

Intussusceptive angiogenesis is also called splitting angiogenesis because the vessel wall extends into the lumen causing a single vessel to split in two. This type of angiogenesis is thought to be fast and efficient compared with sprouting angiogenesis because, initially, it only requires reorganization of existing endothelial cells and does not rely on immediate endothelial proliferation or migration.

## 12.5 Angiogenesis in Cancer

### 12.5.1 Historical Perspective

In 1971, Folkman proposed a new view of the role of blood vessels in tumor growth in the form of a hypothesis that tumor growth is angiogenesis dependent. This hypothesis suggested that tumor cells and vascular endothelial cells within a neoplasm may constitute a highly integrated ecosystem and that endothelial cells may be switched from a resting state to a rapid growth phase by a "diffusible" chemical signal from tumor cells. An additional speculation was that angiogenesis could be a relevant target for tumor therapy (i.e., antiangiogenic therapy).

### 12.5.2 Evidence for Angiogenesis Dependence

Genetic evidence that tumors are angiogenesis dependent began to be reported by the mid-1990s and provides the most compelling proof that tumors and their metastases cannot not grow beyond a microscopic in situ size without recruiting their own blood supply.

A 50% reduction of VEGF-A expression is lethal embryonically because of vascular defects, and excess VEGF-A in tumors induces overproduction of tip cells leading to a disorganized vasculature. This critical dependence on physiological concentrations of VEGF-A for construction of viable blood vessels might help explain why attempts to induce angiogenesis in poorly perfused tissues with VEGF-A administration and gene therapy have not been highly successful.

### 12.5.3 Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Angiogenesis

Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells are involved in crucial processes during tumor development. A subset of monocytes that express the angiopoietin receptor Tie2 play an important role in tumor angiogenesis. Selective depletion of these Tie2-expressing monocytes (TEMs) in tumor-bearing mice inhibits tumor angiogenesis and growth, suggesting that they might regulate angiogenic processes in tumors by providing paracrine support to nascent blood vessels.

Tie2-expressing macrophages play a critical role in both tumor angiogenesis and the dissemination of tumor cells from the primary tumor to secondary sites. Therefore, Ang-Tie2 signaling functions as an angiogenic switch during tumor progression and metastasis.

### 12.5.4 Tumor Angiogenesis in Specific Cancer Types

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a major contributor to the growth of malignant tumors of the central nervous system. It stimulates tumor angiogenesis and vascular proliferation characteristic of high grade gliomas. Elevated expression of VEGF is one the factors responsible for the virulent nature of these tumors.

The progression to high grade is characterized by increased vascularity and the presence of endothelial cell proliferation. Swollen endothelial cells become prominent, and abnormal vascular channels resembling glomerular structures develop in the most undifferentiated lesions. Neoangiogenesis in human glioma is driven by multiple molecules including VEGF, angiopoietins, fibroblast growth factors, platelet derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factors.

## 12.6 Anti-Angiogenic Therapy

### 12.6.1 Therapeutic Rationale

Recognition that control of angiogenesis could have therapeutic value has stimulated great interest during the past 40 years. Stimulation of angiogenesis can be therapeutic in ischemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and wound healing. Decreasing or inhibiting angiogenesis can be therapeutic in cancer, ophthalmic conditions, rheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases.

Angiogenic therapies provide a potential to conquer cancer, heart diseases, and more than 70 of life's most threatening medical conditions. The lives of at least 1 billion people worldwide could be improved with angiogenic therapy, according to the Angiogenesis Foundation.

### 12.6.2 Bevacizumab: Clinical Implementation

Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). It is used to treat several different cancers (cervical cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal cancer, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma). The administration of bevacizumab inhibits microvascular growth and angiogenesis and is used in cancer treatment to inhibit malignant cell growth and blood vessel formation.

Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to all known vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) isoforms. It blocks the interaction between VEGF-A and the VEGF receptors (VEGFR), primarily VEGFR-1 (fit-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDRflk-1), on the surface of endothelial cells. The binding of VEGF-A to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 leads to endothelial cell proliferation, the activation of survival pathways, and the formation of new blood vessels and angiogenesis.

### 12.6.3 Clinical Efficacy of Anti-Angiogenic Therapy

This review found that addition of bevacizumab improved progression-free overall survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who received first- or second-line fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, but at the expense of increased incidence of toxicity.

The authors concluded that, compared with other targeted drugs, bevacizumab plus chemotherapy significantly improved response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival in the treatment of chemotherapy naive patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

### 12.6.4 Toxicities of Anti-Angiogenic Therapy

Ovarian failure: VEGFA is assumed to play an essential role in regulating angiogenesis in the ovary. The incidence of ovarian failure increases in premenopausal women given bevacizumab. Bevacizumab induces ovarian damage; it is likely that this damage is temporary and disappears within the expected drug clearance in most cases.

Congestive heart failure: Bevacizumab treatment significantly increases cancer patients' risk of developing CHF. In a meta-analysis, increased risks of developing CHF were observed in patients with breast cancer, renal cell cancer, and glioblastoma.

This review found that addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapeutic regimens significantly increased the risk of high-grade proteinuria in patients with cancer. Risk of high-grade proteinuria varied according to tumour type. There were statistically significant increases in risk of high-grade proteinuria with all malignancy types except malignant mesothelioma.

This review assessed the overall risk for venous thromboembolism in cancer patients associated with the use of bevacizumab. The authors concluded that the use of bevacizumab was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism in cancer patients receiving this drug.

### 12.6.5 Endogenous Angiogenesis Inhibitors

Endogenous specific inhibitors of endothelial proliferation and of angiogenesis include: angiostatin, a 38 kDa internal fragment of plasminogen (generated by Lewis lung carcinoma), endostatin, a 20 kDa internal fragment of collagen XVIII (generated from a murine hemangioendothelioma), a 53 kDa conformationally changed fragment of antithrombin III (generated from human small cell lung cancer), and tumstatin, a 28 kDa internal fragment of collagen IV (α 3NC1 domain). They do not inhibit proliferation of resting confluent endothelial cells, epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, or tumor cells in vitro.

In SCID mice bearing human pancreatic cancer, human recombinant endostatin was injected into the peritoneal cavity once daily, or delivered continuously by an implanted micro-osmotic pump that released 1 microliter/hour. Continuous dosing inhibited tumor growth 10-fold more effectively than once a day bolus dosing and also induced tumor regression, whereas bolus dosing did not.

## 12.7 Clinical Implications and Future Directions

### 12.7.1 Prognostic Significance

While multiple growth factors influence angiogenesis in glioma, none is more crucial to the process than VEGF. Glial cell lines vary in their production of VEGF, and tumorigenicity correlates with VEGF production. Furthermore, cell lines of low virulence can be converted to a more aggressive phenotype by transfection with VEGF.

### 12.7.2 Combination Therapies

Anti-VEGF treatments should block this therapy-induced resistance and VEGF-induced tumor cell survival, as well as inhibiting angiogenesis. Anti-VEGF treatments used in combination with conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy should dramatically improve treatment for cancer patients, with some initial studies already providing promising results.

Given its vital role in tumor angiogenesis, specific targeting of VEGF signaling has been one of the key avenues in developing anti-angiogenic therapies. One such strategy has employed the development and use of a VEGF neutralising antibody termed Bevacizumab (also known as Avastin). This therapy has been approved for use in a variety of cancer types, such as non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer.

### 12.7.3 Emerging Targets

In summary, anti-angiogenesis and anti-lymphangiogenesis therapies hold great potential in combating the ongoing problem of cancer metastasis and the poor survival rates associated with cancer spread. Research and development of drugs in this area have so far begun to yield positive results with therapies such as Bevacizumab being implemented in the treatment of several cancer types. However, resistance to these anti-angiogenic strategies are possible and thus further research into new and multi target inhibitors of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis is essential in the ongoing fight against cancer spread.

## Conclusion

Angiogenesis represents a critical process in cancer development and progression. The understanding of key molecular mechanisms, particularly involving VEGF and angiopoietin signaling pathways, has led to the development of targeted therapies that have shown clinical benefit in multiple cancer types. However, the complexity of angiogenic networks and the development of resistance mechanisms highlight the need for continued research into novel therapeutic approaches. The integration of anti-angiogenic therapy with conventional treatments continues to evolve, offering hope for improved patient outcomes while requiring careful management of associated toxicities.
