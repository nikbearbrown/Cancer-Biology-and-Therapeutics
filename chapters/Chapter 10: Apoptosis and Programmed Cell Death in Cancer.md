# Chapter 10: Apoptosis and Programmed Cell Death in Cancer

Programmed cell death plays critical roles in a wide variety of physiologic processes during fetal development and in adult tissues. In most cases, physiologic cell death occurs by a process known as "apoptosis." Defects in apoptotic cell death contribute to neoplastic diseases, by preventing or delaying normal cell turnover, thus promoting cell accumulation. Defects in apoptosis also facilitate tumor progression, by rendering cancer cells resistant to death mechanisms relevant to metastasis, hypoxia, growth factor-deprivation, chemotherapy, and irradiation.

The cells of a multicellular organism are members of a highly organized community. The number of cells in this community is tightly regulated—not simply by controlling the rate of cell division, but also by controlling the rate of cell death. The ability of cancer cells to evade apoptosis represents one of the fundamental hallmarks of malignancy and constitutes a critical step in tumor development and therapeutic resistance.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis and their dysregulation in cancer provides essential insights into both the biology of malignant transformation and potential therapeutic interventions. This chapter examines the major apoptotic pathways, explores how cancer cells circumvent these death mechanisms, and discusses emerging therapeutic strategies that target apoptotic machinery.

## 10.1 Pathways of Apoptosis: Intrinsic and Extrinsic

Apoptosis is mediated by proteolytic enzymes called caspases, which trigger cell death by cleaving specific proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Caspases exist in all cells as inactive precursors, or procaspases, which are usually activated by cleavage by other caspases, producing a proteolytic caspase cascade. Two major pathways can initiate this cascade: the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway and the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway.

### 10.1.1 The Intrinsic Apoptotic Pathway

The intrinsic pathway, also known as the mitochondrial pathway, is activated in response to intracellular stress signals including DNA damage, oncogene activation, hypoxia, and withdrawal of survival factors. In the best understood pathway, mitochondria are induced to release the electron carrier protein cytochrome c into the cytosol, where it binds and activates an adaptor protein called Apaf-1.

**Key Components of the Intrinsic Pathway:**

1. **Bcl-2 Family Proteins**: The Bcl-2 family of intracellular proteins helps regulate the activation of procaspases. Some members of this family, like Bcl-2 itself or Bcl-XL, inhibit apoptosis, at least partly by blocking the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.

2. **Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members**: Other members of the Bcl-2 family are not death inhibitors, but instead promote procaspase activation and cell death. Some of these apoptosis promoters, such as Bad, function by binding to and inactivating the death-inhibiting members of the family, whereas others, like Bax and Bak, stimulate the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.

3. **Mitochondrial dysfunction**: If the genes encoding Bax and Bak are both inactivated, cells are remarkably resistant to most apoptosis-inducing stimuli, indicating the crucial importance of these proteins in apoptosis induction.

**Molecular Mechanism:**

The intrinsic pathway is initiated when cellular stress signals trigger the activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Upon apoptosis induction proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins with multidomains such as Bax or Bak translocate from the cytoplasm to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where they oligomerize to form a pore-like structure thereby promoting cytochrome c release.

Once released, cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 in the presence of ATP, forming a large protein complex called the apoptosome. The translocation to mitochondria can be triggered by so called "BH3-only" Bcl-2 family proteins. BH3-only proteins include Bid, which is activated by caspase-8-mediated cleavage, Bim, a microtubule-associated protein, or Noxa and PUMA, two p53-induced proteins. This apoptosome complex recruits and activates procaspase-9, which then cleaves and activates downstream executioner caspases-3 and -7.

### 10.1.2 The Extrinsic Apoptotic Pathway

The extrinsic pathway is initiated by the binding of death ligands to cell surface death receptors, providing a mechanism for external regulation of cell death. Procaspase activation can be triggered from outside the cell by the activation of death receptors on the cell surface. Killer lymphocytes, for example, can induce apoptosis by producing a protein called Fas ligand, which binds to the death receptor protein Fas on the surface of the target cell.

**Key Components of the Extrinsic Pathway:**

1. **Death Receptors**: Membrane death receptors belong to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily and include tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1 (TNF-R1/DR1), Fas (Apo-1/CD95/DR2), death receptor-4 (DR4) and -5 (DR5).

2. **Death Ligands**: These receptors are activated by specific ligands such as TNF-alpha, FasL and TNF-Related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL).

3. **Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC)**: Ligand binding leads to the recruitment of adapter proteins, activation of initiator caspases, and formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Stimulation of death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily such as CD95 (APO-1/Fas) or TRAIL receptors results in receptor aggregation and recruitment of the adaptor molecule Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase-8.

**Molecular Mechanism:**

The clustered Fas proteins then recruit intracellular adaptor proteins that bind and aggregate procaspase-8 molecules, which cleave and activate one another. The activated caspase-8 molecules then activate downstream procaspases to induce apoptosis. Upon recruitment caspase-8 becomes activated and initiates apoptosis by direct cleavage of downstream effector caspases.

### 10.1.3 Convergence and Cross-talk Between Pathways

The receptor and the mitochondrial pathway can be interconnected at different levels. Following death receptor stimulation activation of caspase-8 may result in cleavage of Bid, a BH3 domain containing protein of the Bcl-2 family which assumes cytochrome c-releasing activity upon cleavage thereby initiating a mitochondrial amplification loop.

Two main caspase cascades, one triggered by death receptor stimulation and the other one initiated at the mitochondria, have been identified in response to various inducers of cellular stress such as DNA damage. This cross-talk ensures robust apoptotic signaling and provides multiple checkpoints for regulation.

## 10.2 Evasion of Apoptosis by Cancer Cells

Defects in normal programmed cell death mechanisms play a major role in the pathogenesis of tumors, allowing neoplastic cells to survive beyond their normally intended lifespans, subverting the need for exogenous survival factors, providing protection from hypoxia and oxidative stress as tumor mass expands, and allowing time for accumulative genetic alterations that deregulate cell proliferation, interfere with differentiation, promote angiogenesis, and increase cell motility and invasiveness during tumor progression.

### 10.2.1 Dysregulation of Bcl-2 Family Proteins

Alterations in the amounts of these proteins have been associated with cancer, including excess expression of antiapoptotic and reduced expression of pro-apoptotic BCL-2-family genes. For example, the BCL-2 gene (antiapoptotic) is activated by chromosomal translocations in the majority of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and is also inappropriately over-expressed in many solid tumors, contributing to resistance to chemotherapy- and radiation-induced apoptosis.

**Mechanisms of Bcl-2 Dysregulation:**

1. **Chromosomal Translocations**: Bcl-2 was the first member to be discovered when the encoding gene was found to be translocated in human follicular lymphoma. In follicular lymphoma, a translocation event relocates the Bcl-2 gene from chromosome 18 to chromosome 14, leading to excessive transcription and increased levels of Bcl-2. Elevated Bcl-2 gene levels inhibit APAF-1, consequently inactivating caspases and intrinsic apoptosis, leading to follicular lymphoma.

2. **Gene Amplification and Overexpression**: Bcl-2 protects cells from growth factor deprivation or against exposure to cytotoxic drugs, taxol, cisplatin, glucocorticoids or ionising radiation.

3. **Loss of Pro-apoptotic Members**: Conversely, loss-of-function mutations have been identified in the BAX genes (pro-apoptotic) of human tumors and analysis of bax-/- knock-out mice indicates that bax is a tumor suppressor in vivo.

### 10.2.2 p53 Mutations and Apoptosis Evasion

Mutations or deletions of the p53 gene increase the risk of tumor formation by enabling cells with damaged DNA to divide uncontrollably. Factors such as exposure to chemicals, radiation, and viruses can damage the p53 gene.

**p53-Mediated Apoptosis:**

In perhaps other settings, p53 appears to exert control over the cell's decision to undergo apoptosis or programmed cell death. p53 activates transcription of a number of genes with roles in the control of the cell cycle, including WAF1/CIP1/p21, GADD45, MDM2, and 14-3-3σ, as well as various genes that likely function in apoptosis, including BAX, NOXA, and PUMA.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a key role in the regulation of the cell cycle and cell death. Wild-type (wt) p53 and intact signaling pathways are essential for the prevention of cancer, consistent with a high tumor incidence observed in p53 null mice and in p53-heterozygous Li-Fraumeni patients.

### 10.2.3 Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs)

Another important family of intracellular apoptosis regulators is the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) family. These proteins are thought to inhibit apoptosis in two ways: they bind to some procaspases to prevent their activation, and they bind to caspases to inhibit their activity.

Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) family includes X-linked IAP (XIAP), cIAP1, cIAP2, ILP2, Bruce, Survivin, Livin and NAIP. Overexpression of these proteins lead to chemoresistance and poor prognosis.

### 10.2.4 Death Receptor Pathway Resistance

Decreased expression of death receptors was associated with reduced sensitivity to apoptosis in several cancers. For instance, transcriptional downregulation of FAS/CD95, constitutive endocytosis of DR4 and DR5, and decoy receptors are the potential sources of the resistance mechanism.

## 10.3 Therapeutic Targeting of Apoptosis

Because apoptosis is the main cell death mechanism, targeting apoptotic pathways has a remarkable potential to overcome chemotherapy resistance. Different anticancer therapies including cytotoxic drugs, γ-irradiation, suicide gene therapy, or immunotherapy appear to induce tumor cell death by activating key elements of apoptosis, the cell's intrinsic death program.

### 10.3.1 BCL-2 Inhibitors and BH3 Mimetics

Proof-of-concept experiments performed with synthetic peptides representing the BH3 domain have suggested a path forward in terms of drug discovery. For example, BH3 peptides directed against antiapoptotic proteins over-expressed in cancers (eg, Bcl-2; Bcl-XL) can restore sensitivity to apoptosis, at least in vitro. Accordingly, small-molecule chemical compounds have been delineated that interact with the same BH3-binding pocket on Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, nullifying their cytoprotective actions, and promoting tumor cell apoptosis.

**Clinical Development:**

Pan-BCL-2 inhibitor (-)BI97D6 suppressed MCL-1 and abolished ABT-737 resistance in AML. MCL-1 inhibitor, VU661013, induced apoptosis in venetoclax-resistant AML cells and patient-derived xenografts. Another MCL-1 inhibitor, S63845, killed MCL-1 dependent cancer cells by activating the BAX/BAK dependent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

### 10.3.2 IAP Antagonists

Synthetic peptides that mimic SMAC and HtrA2 induce apoptosis or sensitize tumor cell lines to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic anticancer drugs. Structural information derived from high-field NMR and x-ray crystallography indicate that a tetra-peptide motif is sufficient to bind the BIRs of IAPs, suggesting a path to drug discovery where small-molecule chemical compounds that occupy the same tetra-peptidebinding motif on BIRs can be envisioned as new apoptosis-sensitizing agents for cancer.

Castration-resistant prostate cancer cells were sensitized to enzalutamide using AEG40995 which is an IAP antagonist. AEG40995 degrades cIAP1 protein and combination with enzalutamide increases apoptosis via activation of caspase-8.

### 10.3.3 TRAIL and Death Receptor Agonists

TRAIL and agonists for TRAIL specific receptors, DR4 (TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (TRAIL-R2), are extrinsic pathway inducers that selectively kill tumor cells while harmless to the normal cells. Although they are very advantageous in this regard, inefficient receptor multimerization, poor pharmacokinetic properties, and tumor intrinsic resistance limit their usage in the clinical practice.

Increasing the killing capabilities of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is desired in treating cancer, and a variety of anticancer drugs increase Fas receptor expression in some tumor cell lines. The TNFRSF member TRAIL has shown some promise in being able to selectively kill cancer cells through binding to multiple receptors (DR4 and DR5). Yet, unfortunately, cancer cells have demonstrated the ability to obtain resistance to death by TRAIL.

### 10.3.4 p53 Restoration Strategies

p53 is mutated or functionally inactivated in many types of human cancer, and pharmacological restoration of wild-type p53 conformation and functions by small molecules targeting mutant p53 proteins was suggested as a strategy for design of anti-cancer drugs.

**Therapeutic Approaches:**

1. **Small molecule p53 activators**: Compounds that can restore wild-type p53 function in mutant cells
2. **MDM2 antagonists**: The major negative regulator of p53 is the Mdm2 proto-oncogene. Mdm2 is transcriptionally induced by p53, thus p53 triggers its own destruction through a negative feedback loop. Inhibiting this interaction can reactivate p53 signaling.

### 10.3.5 Combination Therapies and Resistance

Different classes of anticancer drugs initiate their cytotoxicities through a variety of primary molecular targets. Increasingly, however, the view is held that most, if not all, cancer drugs ultimately effect cell death via common downstream signaling pathways associated with programmed cell death or apoptosis.

Failure to activate apoptotic pathways in response to drug treatment may lead to resistance of tumors cells to anticancer therapies. Therefore, factors affecting caspase activation might be important determinants of drug sensitivity.

**Clinical Significance:**

Negative Bcl-2 expression was associated with good chemotherapy response in breast cancer patients. The results suggest that Bcl-2 expression is a predictive factor for chemotherapy sensitivity in breast cancer patients. BCL2 family members have remarkable potential as molecular prognostic markers to predict chemotherapy response in myeloma, leukemia, breast cancer, and solid tumors.

## Summary

Apoptosis represents a fundamental cellular process whose dysregulation is central to cancer pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance. The intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are tightly regulated by multiple protein families, including Bcl-2 family members, IAPs, and caspases. Cancer cells employ various strategies to evade apoptosis, including overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins, loss of pro-apoptotic factors, and mutations in key regulators like p53.

Understanding these mechanisms has led to the development of targeted therapeutic approaches, including BH3 mimetics, IAP antagonists, and death receptor agonists. While significant progress has been made, cancer cell resistance to apoptosis-inducing therapies remains a major clinical challenge. Future therapeutic strategies will likely involve combination approaches that target multiple apoptotic pathways simultaneously, potentially overcoming the redundancy and plasticity that cancer cells exploit to survive.

The continued elucidation of apoptotic mechanisms and their dysregulation in cancer provides ongoing opportunities for therapeutic intervention, offering hope for more effective cancer treatments that can overcome the fundamental ability of cancer cells to evade programmed cell death.
