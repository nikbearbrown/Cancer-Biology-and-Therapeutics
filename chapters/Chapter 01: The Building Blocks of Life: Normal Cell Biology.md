# Chapter 1: The Building Blocks of Life: Normal Cell Biology

## 1.1 Introduction to Cells

Cells are the fundamental units of life, and understanding their molecular biology is an active area of research that is fundamental to all biological sciences. The human body is composed of more than 200 different kinds of cells, each specialized for distinctive functions such as memory, sight, movement, and digestion. All present-day cells, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, are descended from a single ancestor.

Cells are composed of water, inorganic ions, and carbon-containing (organic) molecules. Water is the most abundant molecule in cells, accounting for 70% or more of total cell mass. Each cell is enclosed by a delicate plasma membrane that separates its internal contents from the external environment. Within the cell, the protoplasm consists of both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

The fundamental similarities between different types of cells provide a unifying theme to cell biology, allowing the basic principles learned from experiments with one kind of cell to be extrapolated and generalized to other cell types. Although bacteria have been invaluable models for studies of many conserved properties of cells, they obviously cannot be used to study aspects of cell structure and function that are unique to eukaryotes.

Eukaryotic cells, which are larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells, contain a nucleus, cytoplasmic organelles, and a cytoskeleton. They are thought to have evolved from symbiotic associations of prokaryotes. Understanding normal cellular biology provides the essential foundation for comprehending the aberrant changes that occur in cancer.

## 1.2 Cellular Organelles and Their Functions

Just as the human body relies on specialized organs and tissues to function properly, cells contain distinct components called "organelles," each responsible for a specific function essential to cellular survival. Most cells are between 1 and 100 μm in diameter, and can be observed by light microscopy, as can some of the larger subcellular organelles, such as nuclei, chloroplasts, and mitochondria.

### 1.2.1 Nucleus

The nucleus is the most rigid and largest organelle in the cell, typically occupying its central portion. During cell division, DNA molecules condense into short, rod-like structures called "chromosomes." Human cells typically contain 46 chromosomes, except for mature sex cells, which have a haploid set of 23 chromosomes.

DNA carries the genetic code that directs enzyme production and other cellular proteins, ultimately determining both cell structure and function. Suspended within the nucleus is a nonstaining component called the "nuclear sap," which houses the nucleoli.

### 1.2.2 Ribosomes

Ribosomes measure approximately 15 nm in diameter and exist in both attached and free, unbound forms. Many are tethered to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), while others are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. When found individually, these organelles are referred to as "monosomes," whereas groups of ribosomes are called "polyribosomes." Each ribosome consists of subunits made of RNA, which may be ribosomal (rRNA), messenger (mRNA), or transfer (tRNA) RNA.

### 1.2.3 Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

The rER lumen is continuous with that of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the perinuclear space. This structure primarily modifies synthesized proteins used by the cell. The sER consists of membranes with a smooth outer surface and lacks ribosomes. This organelle is responsible for lipid production and further processing of membrane proteins synthesized by the rER. The sER also aids in drug detoxification.

Only properly folded proteins are delivered to the Golgi apparatus for further processing. If a protein is defective or incompletely folded, it undergoes degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum. An excessive accumulation of misfolded proteins can result in a condition known as endoplasmic reticulum stress, which occurs when protein production surpasses the organelle's capacity to manage and process them effectively.

### 1.2.4 Golgi Apparatus

The Golgi apparatus consists of irregular bodies located near the nucleus. This organelle serves as the cell's processing and distribution center, modifying and sorting proteins and lipids received from the ER and directing them to their appropriate destinations.

### 1.2.5 Mitochondria

Mitochondria are often called the "powerhouses" of the cell, responsible for generating most of the cell's adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria play important roles in cell signaling, both as steroid hormones and as messenger molecules that convey signals from cell surface receptors to targets within the cell.

## 1.3 The Cell Cycle: Growth, Division, and Regulation

The division cycle of most cells consists of four coordinated processes: cell growth, DNA replication, distribution of the duplicated chromosomes to daughter cells, and cell division. In eukaryotes, however, the cell cycle is more complex and consists of four discrete phases.

### 1.3.1 Phases of the Cell Cycle

As viewed in the microscope, the cell cycle is divided into two basic parts: mitosis and interphase. Mitosis (nuclear division) is the most dramatic stage of the cell cycle, corresponding to the separation of daughter chromosomes and usually ending with cell division (cytokinesis). However, mitosis and cytokinesis last only about an hour, so approximately 95% of the cell cycle is spent in interphase—the period between mitoses.

The timing of DNA synthesis divides the cycle of eukaryotic cells into four discrete phases. The M phase of the cycle corresponds to mitosis, which is usually followed by cytokinesis. This phase is followed by the G1 phase (gap 1), which corresponds to the interval (gap) between mitosis and initiation of DNA replication. During G1, the cell is metabolically active and continuously grows but does not replicate its DNA. G1 is followed by S phase (synthesis), during which DNA replication takes place. The completion of DNA synthesis is followed by the G2 phase (gap 2), during which cell growth continues and proteins are synthesized in preparation for mitosis.

For a typical rapidly proliferating human cell with a total cycle time of 24 hours, the G1 phase might last about 11 hours, S phase about 8 hours, G2 about 4 hours, and M about 1 hour.

### 1.3.2 Regulation of the Cell Cycle

Cyclins and Cyclin-dependent kinases, also known as CDK's, are the 2 major proteins that play a role in regulating the cell cycle. These CDK's are created throughout the cell cycle and are used to phosphorylate downstream proteins essential for healthy cell growth. On the other hand, cyclin is only created during specific times of the cell cycle and acts as a regulator.

An ordered sequence of cyclin-Cdk activities triggers most of the events of the cell cycle. During G1 phase, Cdk activity is reduced to a minimum by Cdk inhibitors (CKIs), cyclin proteolysis, and decreased cyclin gene transcription. When environmental conditions are favorable, G1- and G1/S-Cdks increase in concentration, overcoming these inhibitory barriers in late G1 and triggering the activation of S-Cdk.

The G1 checkpoint blocks progression into S phase by inhibiting the activation of G1/S-Cdk and S-Cdk complexes. In mammalian cells, for example, DNA damage leads to the activation of the gene regulatory protein p53, which stimulates the transcription of several genes. One of these genes encodes a CKI protein called p21, which binds to G1/S-Cdk and S-Cdk and inhibits their activities, thereby helping to block entry into S phase.

### 1.3.3 Cell Cycle Dysregulation in Cancer

When either of these proteins is not functioning correctly, downstream elements are not properly functioning, such as the INK4a/ARF, which encodes for tumor suppressor proteins. However, tumors may grow, leading to cancer in these specific cells.

The main tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in maintaining the cell cycle is p53, which is a transcription factor that plays a role in promoting growth arrest, DNA repair, and eventual apoptosis, or regulated death by the cell in damaging situations.

## 1.4 DNA, RNA, and Protein Synthesis

### 1.4.1 DNA Structure and Organization

Although the DNA helical diameter is only 2 nm, the entire DNA strand in a single cell will stretch roughly 2 meters when completely unwound. The entire DNA strand must fit within the nucleus of a cell, so it must be very tightly packaged to fit. This is accomplished by wrapping the DNA around structural histone proteins, which act as scaffolding for the DNA to be coiled around.

The entire structure is called a nucleosome, each of which includes an octamer of histone proteins and 146 to 147 base pairs of DNA. The millions of nucleosomes tightly coil the continuous DNA strand into chromatin which is further condensed into the chromosome classically visualized during cell division.

### 1.4.2 DNA Replication

The process of replication allows cells to generate new genetic material (DNA) using original DNA as a template. The cell cycle consists of four phases-G1, S, G2, and M. During the G1 phase, cells grow and produce material like nucleotide precursors as preparation for DNA replication in the S-phase. Replication occurs in the S-phase cell and new genetic material is synthesized as a preparation for the cell division.

The process is highly regulated and requires many different enzymes that include DNA polymerases. The replication process is highly accurate, due to the proofreading ability of DNA polymerase.

Replication occurs at many origins of replication throughout the DNA strand to accelerate the replication of the entire genome, with each origin separated by approximately 100,000 base pairs. The DNA does not interact with histones during this process to allow for the propagation of the polymerase enzymes.

### 1.4.3 Transcription: From DNA to RNA

All of the RNA in a cell is made by DNA transcription, a process that has certain similarities to the process of DNA replication. Transcription begins with the opening and unwinding of a small portion of the DNA double helix to expose the bases on each DNA strand. One of the two strands of the DNA double helix then acts as a template for the synthesis of an RNA molecule.

RNA polymerase catalyzes essentially the same chemical reaction as DNA polymerase, there are some important differences between the two enzymes. First, and most obvious, RNA polymerase catalyzes the linkage of ribonucleotides, not deoxyribonucleotides. Second, unlike the DNA polymerases involved in DNA replication, RNA polymerases can start an RNA chain without a primer.

RNA synthesis requires RNA polymerase I for ribosomal RNA, RNA polymerase II for mRNA and microRNA, and RNA polymerase III for tRNA and other small RNAs. Transcription is not as accurate as replication and produces more errors.

### 1.4.4 Translation: From RNA to Protein

Transcription and translation are the means by which cells read out, or express, the genetic instructions in their genes. Because many identical RNA copies can be made from the same gene, and each RNA molecule can direct the synthesis of many identical protein molecules, cells can synthesize a large amount of protein rapidly when necessary.

Translation is the process by which the genetic information encoded in mRNA is used to synthesize proteins. This process occurs on ribosomes and involves the sequential addition of amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain.

## 1.5 Cell Communication and Signaling Pathways

These observations increase the long list of signal-transduction components that are known to be altered in cancer, such as Ras, Myc, Src, and Erb B. Thus, it is clear that disruption of signal-transduction pathways is a commonly observed event in human cancer and provides a target for therapeutic intervention.

Cell signaling enables cells to respond to their environment, coordinate activities with neighboring cells, and maintain tissue homeostasis. Disruption of signaling pathways is a common feature of cancer, often resulting in uncontrolled proliferation, resistance to cell death, and other hallmark capabilities of malignant cells.

## 1.6 Tissue Organization and Organ Systems

Many organisms, such as bacteria, amoebas, and yeasts, consist of single cells that are capable of independent self-replication. More complex organisms are composed of collections of cells that function in a coordinated manner, with different cells specialized to perform particular tasks.

Cells in multicellular organisms are organized into tissues, which combine to form organs and organ systems. This hierarchical organization enables the specialization and coordination necessary for complex physiological functions.

## 1.7 Cell Death: Apoptosis and Necrosis

Apoptosis, first identified in the 1970s, was initially perceived as a process comparable to mitosis. Commonly referred to as programmed cell death, it plays an essential role in maintaining a balance with mitosis by regulating cell populations during development, preserving tissue homeostasis in adults, and contributing to various biological processes.

### 1.7.1 Apoptosis: Programmed Cell Death

The cells of a multicellular organism are members of a highly organized community. The number of cells in this community is tightly regulated—not simply by controlling the rate of cell division, but also by controlling the rate of cell death. If cells are no longer needed, they commit suicide by activating an intracellular death program. This process is therefore called programmed cell death, although it is more commonly called apoptosis.

The amount of apoptosis that occurs in developing and adult animal tissues can be astonishing. In the developing vertebrate nervous system, for example, up to half or more of the nerve cells normally die soon after they are formed. In a healthy adult human, billions of cells die in the bone marrow and intestine every hour.

Apoptosis comes from the Greek word for the natural processes of leaves falling from trees or petals from flowers. It is active and can be evolutionarily selected. The other type of cell death, necrosis, is a pathological death caused by external factors such as inflammation or toxic injury.

#### Molecular Mechanisms of Apoptosis

All the pathways involve the activation of caspases as the final step. The intrinsic pathway is activated when the cell experiences internal stress due to various factors such as DNA damage from x-ray or UV light exposure, chemotherapeutic agents, hypoxia, or the accumulation of misfolded proteins inside the cell.

The extrinsic pathway is triggered when the cell receives death signals from other cells. This pathway is receptor-linked, and the ligands from the other cells bind to these death receptors on the cell surface, activating apoptosis.

In the best understood pathway, mitochondria are induced to release the electron carrier protein cytochrome c into the cytosol, where it binds and activates an adaptor protein called Apaf-1. This mitochondrial pathway of procaspase activation is recruited in most forms of apoptosis to initiate or to accelerate and amplify the caspase cascade.

#### Regulation of Apoptosis

The Bcl-2 family of intracellular proteins helps regulate the activation of procaspases. Some members of this family, like Bcl-2 itself or Bcl-XL, inhibit apoptosis, at least partly by blocking the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Other members of the Bcl-2 family are not death inhibitors, but instead promote procaspase activation.

Regulation of programmed cell death is mediated by the integrated activity of a variety of signaling pathways, some acting to promote cell death and others acting to promote cell survival.

### 1.7.2 Necrosis: Uncontrolled Cell Death

Irreversible cell injury and eventual cell death due to pathological processes are termed necrosis. It is an uncontrolled cell death that results in swelling of the cell organelles, plasma membrane rupture and eventual lysis of the cell, and spillage of intracellular contents into the surrounding tissue leading to tissue damage.

Unlike programmed cell death known as apoptosis which generates from intrinsic signals, necrosis occurs due to overwhelming noxious stimulus from outside the cell and is almost always associated with inflammatory responses due to the release of heat shock proteins, uric acid, ATP, DNA, and nuclear proteins, which cause inflammasome activation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL1).

## 1.8 Cancer: Disruption of Normal Cell Biology

Cancer is a particularly appropriate topic because it results from a breakdown of the regulatory mechanisms that govern normal cell behavior. The proliferation, differentiation, and survival of individual cells in multicellular organisms are carefully regulated to meet the needs of the organism as a whole. This regulation is lost in cancer cells, which grow and divide in an uncontrolled manner, ultimately spreading throughout the body and interfering with the function of normal tissues and organs.

### 1.8.1 Cancer as a Microevolutionary Process

The body of an animal operates as a society or ecosystem whose individual members are cells, reproducing by cell division and organized into collaborative assemblies or tissues. Unlike free-living cells such as bacteria, which compete to survive, the cells of a multicellular organism are committed to collaboration.

Molecular disturbances that upset this harmony mean trouble for a multicellular society. In a human body with more than 10^14 cells, billions of cells experience mutations every day, potentially disrupting the social controls. Most dangerously, a mutation may give one cell a selective advantage, allowing it to divide more vigorously than its neighbors and to become a founder of a growing mutant clone.

These are the basic ingredients of cancer: it is a disease in which individual mutant clones of cells begin by prospering at the expense of their neighbors, but in the end destroy the whole cellular society.

### 1.8.2 Properties of Cancer Cells

Cancer cells are defined by two heritable properties: they and their progeny (1) reproduce in defiance of the normal restraints on cell division and (2) invade and colonize territories normally reserved for other cells. It is the combination of these actions that makes cancers peculiarly dangerous.

The fundamental abnormality resulting in the development of cancer is the continual unregulated proliferation of cancer cells. Rather than responding appropriately to the signals that control normal cell behavior, cancer cells grow and divide in an uncontrolled manner, invading normal tissues and organs and eventually spreading throughout the body.

### 1.8.3 Cancer Development

In simple terms, cancer is a group of more than 100 diseases that develop across time and involve the uncontrolled division of the body's cells. Although cancer can develop in virtually any of the body's tissues, and each type of cancer has its unique features, the basic processes that produce cancer are quite similar in all forms of the disease.

Cancer begins when a cell breaks free from the normal restraints on cell division and begins to follow its own agenda for proliferation. All of the cells produced by division of this first, ancestral cell and its progeny also display inappropriate proliferation.

An estimated 10^16 cell divisions take place in a normal human body in the course of a lifetime. Clearly, if a single mutation were enough to convert a typical healthy cell into a cancer cell that proliferates without restraint, we would not be viable organisms. Many types of evidence indicate that the genesis of a cancer typically requires that several independent, rare accidents occur in the lineage of one cell.

### 1.8.4 Genetic Instability in Cancer

The great majority of human cancers show signs of a dramatically enhanced mutation rate: the cells are said to be genetically unstable. This instability can take various forms. Some cancer cells are defective in the ability to repair local DNA damage or to correct replication errors that affect individual nucleotides.

Cancer cells can also use specific telomerase to create long repeated sequences of telomeres that prevent the cell from going through apoptosis even after many repeats. The maintenance of all cell functions is important to prevent cancer growth; even small changes in certain genes can cause the over division of cells.

## Summary

This chapter has provided a comprehensive overview of normal cell biology based on authoritative sources from the NCBI Bookshelf. Understanding cancer has been an objective of molecular and cellular biologists for many years. Importantly, studies of cancer cells have also illuminated the mechanisms that regulate normal cell behavior. In fact, many of the proteins that play key roles in cell signaling, regulation of the cell cycle, and control of programmed cell death were first identified because abnormalities in their activities led to the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells.

Key themes that emerge from this exploration include:

1. **Cellular Organization**: Cells contain distinct organelles, each responsible for specific functions essential to cellular survival.

2. **Cell Cycle Regulation**: An ordered sequence of cyclin-Cdk activities triggers most of the events of the cell cycle, with multiple checkpoints ensuring proper progression.

3. **Programmed Cell Death**: Apoptosis plays an essential role in maintaining a balance with mitosis by regulating cell populations during development and preserving tissue homeostasis in adults.

4. **Cancer as Disrupted Biology**: Cancer is a disease in which individual mutant clones of cells begin by prospering at the expense of their neighbors, but in the end destroy the whole cellular society.

Understanding these normal cellular processes provides the necessary context for exploring the molecular and cellular alterations that drive cancer development and progression, setting the foundation for subsequent chapters on cancer biology and therapeutics.
