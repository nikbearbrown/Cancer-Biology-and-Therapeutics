# Chapter 17: Cancer Prevention and Screening

Cancer prevention and screening represent fundamental pillars in the comprehensive strategy to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. These approaches operate through distinct mechanisms: primary prevention aims to prevent cancer from occurring altogether, while secondary prevention seeks to detect cancer or precancerous lesions at early, more treatable stages. This chapter examines evidence-based strategies across the prevention spectrum, from lifestyle modifications and vaccination to organized screening programs and chemoprevention.

## 17.1 Primary Prevention: Lifestyle Modifications, Vaccinations

Primary prevention represents the most desirable strategy for reducing cancer burden by keeping individuals from developing cancer in the first place. The most desirable strategy for the amelioration of suffering from cancer is primary prevention, a public health approach which keeps people from acquiring cancer in the first place. While the fundamental etiologies of cancer are not fully understood, substantial evidence supports the role of modifiable risk factors in cancer development.

### 17.1.1 Modifiable Risk Factors and Lifestyle Interventions

Much of the burden of cancer in the United States can be traced to modifiable health behaviors that increase one's risk of disease. The major lifestyle factors that contribute significantly to cancer incidence include tobacco use, physical inactivity, overweight and obesity, poor diet, and alcohol consumption. These factors not only increase cancer risk but also contribute to other chronic diseases, making their modification particularly beneficial for overall health.

#### Tobacco Control: The Single Most Important Prevention Strategy

Tobacco is the scourge of public health. In the United States alone, tobacco use, primarily in the form of cigarette smoking, causes more than 440,000 premature deaths from cancer and other causes each year and is responsible for approximately 30 percent of all cancer-related deaths. The causal relationship between tobacco use and multiple cancer types has been firmly established through decades of research.

**Key Evidence:**
- Tobacco accounts for approximately 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States
- Worldwide, tobacco-related deaths are expected to double by 2020, reaching approximately 8 million deaths annually
- Helping the 23.5 percent of adults who smoke cigarettes discontinue their habit and preventing youth from adopting the habit of tobacco use will save more lives than the sum of all the incremental benefits of improving cancer screening rates or cancer treatments.

**Intervention Strategies:**
- Comprehensive tobacco control programs combining policy, education, and clinical interventions
- Smoking cessation programs with behavioral counseling and pharmacological support
- Youth prevention programs targeting initiation
- Environmental policies including smoke-free laws and taxation

#### Nutrition and Physical Activity

One-third of cancer deaths are thought to be related to nutrition and other lifestyle factors including body weight, physical activity, and food choices. The evidence linking diet, physical activity, and body weight to cancer risk has grown substantially, leading to specific recommendations for cancer prevention.

**Dietary Factors:**
- Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables may reduce risk for several cancer types
- Limitation of processed and red meat consumption
- Reduction of alcohol intake
- Maintenance of adequate fiber intake
- Limitation of high-energy foods with excessive fat, sugar, and salt

**Physical Activity and Body Weight:**
- Regular physical activity reduces risk for multiple cancer types
- Maintenance of healthy body weight throughout life
- The WCRF/AICR recommendations... highlighting the importance of maintaining a healthy body weight through appropriate levels of physical activity and a balanced diet, predominantly based on plant foods, with no more than modest amounts of meat and dairy, and limiting the amounts of processed meat, salt, and alcohol.

#### Infectious Agent Prevention and Vaccination

Several cancers are directly linked to infectious agents, providing opportunities for prevention through vaccination and infection control measures.

**Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination:**
- Prevents cervical, anal, oropharyngeal, and other cancers
- Most effective when administered before sexual activity begins
- We have an opportunity through the development of cancer vaccines and the cervical cancer vaccine trials that are underway to be able to eliminate disease by a preventative interventional strategy.

**Hepatitis B Vaccination:**
- Prevents hepatocellular carcinoma
- Particularly important in endemic areas
- Part of routine childhood immunization schedules in many countries

**Other Infectious Disease Prevention:**
- Helicobacter pylori eradication to reduce gastric cancer risk
- Safe sexual practices to reduce transmission of oncogenic viruses
- Blood safety measures to prevent hepatitis and HIV transmission

### 17.1.2 Environmental and Occupational Exposures

Primary prevention also encompasses reducing exposure to environmental carcinogens and implementing workplace safety measures.

**Key Environmental Factors:**
- Ultraviolet radiation exposure and skin cancer prevention
- Radon exposure reduction in homes
- Air pollution reduction
- Occupational carcinogen exposure control
- Chemical safety in consumer products

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Regulatory policies limiting exposure to known carcinogens
- Personal protective measures (sunscreen, protective clothing)
- Environmental monitoring and remediation
- Occupational health and safety programs

## 17.2 Secondary Prevention: Early Detection and Screening Programs

A complementary strategy to preventing the occurrence of cancer (primary prevention) is early detection of cancer through screening (secondary prevention). The fundamental tenet of screening for cancer is that finding the disease before symptoms develop enables detection at a less advanced stage and that instituting treatment at that time leads ultimately to improved health outcomes.

### 17.2.1 Principles of Cancer Screening

**Definition and Goals:**
Cancer screening markers are defined as tests... When systematically applied to populations, they identify asymptomatic individuals at sufficient risk of cancer to justify use of additional markers or clinical intervention. The goal is to detect malignant disease or precancerous lesions at stages when existing clinical interventions are most effective.

**Essential Characteristics of Effective Screening:**
1. **High Sensitivity:** Ability to detect disease when present (high true-positive rate)
2. **High Specificity:** Ability to correctly identify those without disease (low false-positive rate)
3. **Positive Predictive Value:** Proportion of positive tests that are truly positive
4. **Accessibility:** Tests must be feasible for population-based application
5. **Cost-effectiveness:** Benefits must outweigh costs and potential harms

### 17.2.2 Evidence-Based Screening Programs

#### Breast Cancer Screening

Multiple randomized studies have established that routine screening mammography should be offered to women aged 50 to 69. Recent guidelines have expanded recommendations to include earlier screening initiation.

**Current Recommendations:**
- The latest guidelines from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) now advocate starting routine mammograms at age 40.
- Biennial screening is considered reasonable, particularly for women 55 and older
- Screening continuation until life expectancy is less than 10 years

**Impact:**
- From 1989 to 2015, breast cancer mortality dropped by 39%. The mortality rate among women aged 50 and older has continued to decline since 2007.
- Most breast cancers are now diagnosed at stage I, with 100% five-year survival rate

#### Cervical Cancer Screening

Cervical cancer screening represents one of the most successful cancer prevention programs, demonstrating the potential for dramatic impact on cancer mortality.

**Historical Impact:**
Cervical cancer mortality, which was a leading cause of cancer death of women in America (and is still the leading cause of cancer death in women in most other parts of the world), is now controlled for most women in this country, and could be eradicated if we could solve the access problem.

**Screening Methods:**
- Papanicolaou (Pap) cytology testing
- HPV DNA testing
- Co-testing strategies combining cytology and HPV testing

#### Colorectal Cancer Screening

The Minnesota trial demonstrated that annual and biennial screening by FOBT reduced the mortality rates by 33 percent and 21 percent, respectively... screening also reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, for the annually and biennially screened groups.

**Screening Modalities:**
- Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT)
- Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT)
- Colonoscopy
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy
- CT colonography

**Dual Benefits:**
This suggests that, in addition to secondary prevention (early detection of cancer), FOBT also achieves primary prevention (preventing the occurrence of cancer), presumably by leading those screened to colonoscopy, thus facilitating the detection (and removal) of premalignant polyps.

#### Lung Cancer Screening

Recent evidence supports lung cancer screening in high-risk populations, particularly heavy smokers.

**Target Population:**
- Adults aged 50-80 years with significant smoking history
- Current smokers or those who quit within the past 15 years
- Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening

**Considerations:**
- The impact the national lung screening trial could have through just one intervention such as a radiological technique.
- Balance between benefits and risks of radiation exposure
- Importance of smoking cessation counseling concurrent with screening

### 17.2.3 Emerging Technologies in Cancer Screening

#### Multi-Cancer Early Detection Tests

Multi-cancer early detection technologies aim to provide a new approach to complement traditional cancer screening programs. These tests examine genetic signals within blood samples with next-generation sequencing and computational algorithms to assess the presence and type of different cancers.

**Advantages:**
- Because multi-cancer early detection technologies rely on blood samples, their simplicity may offer several advantages for screening that could potentially improve accessibility, reduce test discomfort, and reach a greater number of people when complemented with traditional screening tests.
- Potential to detect cancers without established screening programs
- May help overcome barriers to traditional screening methods

**Current Status:**
- Several tests in development and clinical evaluation
- Need for large-scale validation studies to establish clinical utility
- Regulatory approval processes ongoing

### 17.2.4 Challenges and Limitations of Screening

#### Potential Harms of Screening

The benefits of early detection of cancer must be weighed not only against the harms of screening but also against the harms of treatment.

**Key Concerns:**
1. **False-positive results:** Leading to unnecessary anxiety and additional testing
2. **Overdiagnosis:** Detection of cancers that would never have caused symptoms
3. **False-negative results:** Missing cancers, providing false reassurance
4. **Opportunity costs:** The diversion of attention, time, and resources away from the primary prevention of cancer and other measures with greater health benefit to patients than screening.

#### Implementation Challenges

Screening programs can effectively reduce the burden of cancer if they ensure that people get the tests that they need and that tests are performed accurately, are not conducted too often, and are followed up in a timely and appropriate manner.

**System-Level Challenges:**
- Ensuring access to screening across diverse populations
- Maintaining quality control in screening programs
- Developing effective follow-up systems for abnormal results
- Addressing disparities in screening participation

## 17.3 Chemoprevention

Chemoprevention represents a distinct approach to cancer prevention through the use of natural or synthetic agents to prevent, delay, or reverse carcinogenesis.

### 17.3.1 Definition and Rationale

Chemoprevention is the use of substances to lower the risk of cancer, or keep it from recurring. The substances may be natural or made in the laboratory. This approach is based on the understanding that cancer develops through a multi-step process that can potentially be interrupted at various stages.

**Categories of Chemopreventive Agents:**
Agents for chemoprevention of cancer fall into two principal categories: (a) those that prevent the mutagenic initiation of the carcinogenic process ("blocking" agents) and (b) those that prevent the further promotion or progression of lesions that have already been established ("suppressing" agents).

### 17.3.2 Established Chemopreventive Agents

#### Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs)

**Tamoxifen:**
Strong, direct evidence shows that tamoxifen reduces by approximately half the incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer.

- FDA-approved for breast cancer risk reduction in high-risk women
- 49% reduction in invasive breast cancer incidence
- Benefits must be weighed against risks including endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events

**Raloxifene:**
Evidence from one study suggests that raloxifene reduces by the same amount the incidence of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at low to average risk for breast cancer.

- Approved for breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women
- Does not increase endometrial cancer risk
- Provides additional bone health benefits

#### 5α-Reductase Inhibitors

**Finasteride:**
We have established at least proof of principle that chemoprevention in an area such as prostate cancer is achievable, with a 25 percent reduction in incidence.

- 25% reduction in prostate cancer incidence in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial
- Concerns about potential increase in high-grade tumors
- Benefits and risks require careful consideration

#### Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

**Aspirin:**
Aspirin has been studied extensively as a chemopreventive agent. However, the evidence of benefit for the prevention of cancer or cancer deaths in the general population is mixed, but generally negative.

- Both case-control and cohort studies show a reduced risk for colorectal cancer after prolonged use of aspirin.
- Potential benefits for colorectal cancer prevention in specific populations
- Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding must be considered
- Before beginning long-term aspirin use, it is important to talk with your doctor about the related benefits and harms.

### 17.3.3 Investigational Approaches

#### Antioxidants and Vitamins

The results of large-scale trials testing antioxidant supplements have been largely disappointing:

None of the RCTs of primary chemoprevention showed the interventions tested to be effective in preventing lung cancer. In two trials in smokers, beta-carotene was associated with a statistically-significant increased incidence of lung cancer.

**Key Findings:**
- Beta-carotene supplements increased lung cancer risk in smokers
- Vitamin E and selenium trials showed no benefit for most cancers
- Complex interactions between nutrients and cancer risk

#### Novel Agents Under Investigation

If chemoprevention is truly to have a practical impact on the control of cancer, it will be necessary to develop a fundamentally pharmacologic approach to the problem.

**Promising Areas:**
- COX-2 inhibitors for colorectal cancer prevention
- Retinoids for skin and head/neck cancer prevention
- Calcium and vitamin D for colorectal cancer
- Metformin for multiple cancer types

### 17.3.4 Challenges in Chemoprevention

#### Risk-Benefit Considerations

Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduce the incidence of breast cancer in women over a wide range of ages and levels of breast cancer risk. Both drugs may also have other benefits, but they may cause harm in otherwise healthy women who take them for prophylaxis.

**Key Challenges:**
- Administering active agents to healthy individuals
- Long-term safety considerations
- Individual risk assessment and counseling
- Cost-effectiveness of intervention

#### Target Population Selection

Some chemopreventive agents are tested in people who are at high risk for a certain type of cancer. The risk may be because of a precancerous condition, family history, or lifestyle factors.

**Considerations for Target Selection:**
- Genetic predisposition (BRCA mutations, Lynch syndrome)
- Precancerous lesions (colonic polyps, ductal carcinoma in situ)
- Environmental exposures
- Age and life expectancy

## 17.4 Integration of Prevention Strategies

### 17.4.1 Multilevel Prevention Approaches

The benefits of intervention are far greater when reductions in the incidence of other chronic diseases add to reductions in the incidence of cancer achieved through lifestyle changes.

**Individual Level:**
- Personal behavior modification
- Risk assessment and counseling
- Adherence to screening guidelines

**Healthcare System Level:**
- Provider education and training
- Clinical decision support systems
- Quality improvement initiatives

**Population Level:**
- Public health policies
- Environmental regulations
- Community-based interventions

### 17.4.2 Future Directions

#### Precision Prevention

Advances in genomics and molecular biology are enabling more personalized approaches to cancer prevention:

- Genetic risk assessment and counseling
- Biomarker-guided screening strategies
- Targeted chemoprevention based on individual risk profiles

#### Technology Integration

Our opportunities in genomics and proteomics, in terms of our ability to detect cancer early in its course and predict its biologic behavior, are rapidly unfolding advantages from our proteomics initiative.

**Emerging Technologies:**
- Artificial intelligence in screening programs
- Liquid biopsy technologies
- Mobile health applications for prevention support

### 17.4.3 Implementation and Policy Considerations

#### Healthcare Policy

Effective cancer prevention requires supportive healthcare policies:

- Insurance coverage for preventive services
- Quality metrics for prevention programs
- Resource allocation for prevention research

#### Public Health Infrastructure

Federal departments and agencies were directed to establish a policy that provides up to 4 hours of excused absence each year, without a loss of pay or a charge to leave, for participation in preventive health screenings.

**Essential Components:**
- Surveillance systems for monitoring cancer trends
- Prevention program evaluation
- Health disparities reduction efforts
- International collaboration on prevention strategies

## Conclusion

Cancer prevention and screening represent critical components of comprehensive cancer control. The evidence clearly demonstrates that substantial reductions in cancer incidence and mortality are achievable through implementation of evidence-based prevention strategies. Scientists estimate that as many as one-half of the deaths from cancer in the United States and Europe... could theoretically be prevented.

The integration of primary prevention through lifestyle modification and vaccination, secondary prevention through organized screening programs, and tertiary prevention through chemoprevention offers multiple opportunities to reduce cancer burden. However, successful implementation requires coordinated efforts across multiple levels of intervention, from individual behavior change to population-wide policy initiatives.

As our understanding of cancer biology continues to advance, precision approaches to prevention will become increasingly important. The challenge for healthcare professionals and public health officials is to translate this growing knowledge into effective, equitable, and sustainable prevention programs that can achieve the ultimate goal of cancer elimination as a major public health problem.

**Key Clinical Takeaways:**
1. Tobacco cessation remains the single most important cancer prevention intervention
2. Evidence-based screening programs can dramatically reduce cancer mortality when properly implemented
3. Chemoprevention offers promise for high-risk individuals but requires careful risk-benefit assessment
4. Successful cancer prevention requires coordinated efforts at individual, healthcare system, and population levels
5. Emerging technologies offer new opportunities for early detection and prevention, but require rigorous evaluation before widespread implementation
