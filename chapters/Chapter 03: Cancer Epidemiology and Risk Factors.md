# Chapter 3: Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## 3.1 Global Cancer Incidence and Mortality

### 3.1.1 Current Global Cancer Burden

Cancer has emerged as a leading cause of death worldwide, with NCDs accounting for 72% of all deaths globally in 2016. Of the 15.2 million premature deaths from NCDs, 4.5 million (29.8%) were due to cancer. Each year, 5 million people in low- and middle-income countries die from cancer, representing about 10 percent of the 50 million deaths in those countries.

The most common cancer worldwide is lung cancer with 2.1 million new cases in 2018, followed by 1.8 million deaths. The global cancer burden continues to demonstrate significant variation by development level and geographic region.

**Leading Cancer Types Globally**

In 2018, 45% of the estimated new cancer cases occurred in countries with very high HDI, compared with 36%, 16%, and 4% in countries with high, medium, and low HDI, respectively. The distribution of cancer types varies significantly by development level:

In countries with low HDI, there is a high residual burden of infection- and poverty-related cancers, where cancers of the cervix, liver, and oesophagus are leading cancers, compared with countries with high or very high HDI, where the most frequent cancers are those of the prostate, breast, colorectum, and lung.

**Cancer Mortality Patterns**

The greatest number of cancer deaths occurred in countries with high HDI, driven by the 2.9 million cancer deaths that occurred in China. However, mortality-to-incidence ratios vary substantially by development level, with lower-resource countries experiencing poorer outcomes despite lower incidence rates.

### 3.1.2 Regional Variations in Cancer Burden

**High-Income Countries (HICs)**

In the USA and other high-income countries, declines in smoking prevalence have resulted in substantial decreases in incidence rates of lung cancer and laryngeal cancer. Elsewhere, and especially in low- and middle-income countries, the cancer burden from smoking continues to increase as a result of population growth and the ageing of smokers.

**Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)**

The majority of cancer cases globally now occur in LMIC, and 65% of cancer deaths worldwide occur in these countries. These countries face a distinct cancer profile characterized by:

In countries with medium HDI, there is still a large burden of infection-related cancers, including cancers of the stomach, liver, and oesophagus. In 2012, the proportion of new cancer cases attributable to infectious agents was 25.3%, 21.5%, 13.2%, and 7.6% in countries with low, medium, high, and very high HDI, respectively.

**Regional Cancer Patterns**

The incidence of colon and rectal cancers varies about 25-fold from the high-income and high incidence areas (North America, Australia and New Zealand, Western Europe, and Japan) to Africa and Asia, where incidence is lowest. Specific regional patterns include:

- **Colorectal cancer**: Where rates historically have been low (particularly in Asia), they seem to be rising
- **Breast cancer**: Breast cancer is increasing in incidence everywhere, but more so where rates historically have been low. In China, annual increases of 3 to 4 percent are reported
- **Liver cancer**: Although it is sixth in incidence worldwide, it is third in mortality, after lung and stomach cancers. With 5-year survival at 5 percent or less even in developed countries

### 3.1.3 Temporal Trends in Cancer Incidence and Mortality

**Changing Cancer Patterns**

The ongoing cancer transition includes a reduction in infection-related cancers (for example, stomach and cervical cancer) that is offset by increases in cancers linked to a Westernization of lifestyle (for example, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer).

**Stomach Cancer Trends**

A key epidemiological finding is the steady decline in incidence and mortality rates of stomach cancer (predominantly the non-cardia type of stomach cancer) that has consistently been observed over more than five decades across all world regions. In contrast to the overall decline in rates of non-cardia stomach cancer, studies have indicated an increasing incidence of cardia stomach cancer in several populations.

### 3.1.4 Cancer Surveillance and Monitoring Systems

**Population-Based Cancer Registries**

The central purpose of state cancer registries is cancer surveillance, monitoring the burden of cancer for a given population. When registration activities are organized to obtain complete counts of cancer for a given population, the system is said to be "population-based".

The need of accurate data of cancer cases in a country is imperative to develop cancer control programs and screening guidelines. Unless the burden of each cancer type and subtype is known, it is hard to allocate appropriate resources for prevention or treatment of the specific types of cancer.

**International Collaborative Efforts**

IARC is responsible for the compilation, estimation, and reporting of cancer statistics generated through flagship projects and databases, including Cancer Incidence in Five Continents and GLOBOCAN, for which the resulting statistics are disseminated on the Global Cancer Observatory.

IARC gathers data on incidence, mortality, and survival for hundreds of countries. The data are available electronically and in published reports. Most prominently, the 8th edition of its report, Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, includes information on more than 200 countries. IARC also estimates cancer incidence and mortality for every country in the world in its GLOBOCAN electronic database.

**Data Quality Challenges**

About 18 percent of low-income countries have recorded mortality data any time since 1950, and about 35 percent have published some population-based incidence data, although fewer than half of them are represented in the most recent edition of IARC's Cancer Incidence in Five Continents.

With a greater number of governments adopting national cancer control plans, attention is increasingly turning to population-based cancer surveillance data as a central component in prioritizing and evaluating interventions. For many LMICs, national vital statistics are unavailable, partial, or inaccurate.

## 3.2 Genetic vs. Environmental Contributions

### 3.2.1 Frameworks for Understanding Cancer Causation

**Multifactorial Models of Disease**

The second approach to studying how variations in genes contribute to variations in disease risk focuses on understanding the genetic susceptibility to diseases as the consequence of the joint effects of many genes, each with small to moderate effects and often interacting among themselves and with the environment to give rise to the distribution of disease risk seen in a population.

In most cases, the combined effects of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors determine a person's likelihood of being affected with a condition, such as cancer. Clustering of cancer among relatives is common. However, determining the underlying causes of this is difficult when there is not a clear pattern of cancer in the family.

**Gene-Environment Interactions**

The interactions of multiple modifier genes with various environmental factors—that is, gene–environment interactions—explain why cancer rates vary across populations, among exposed groups, and even within families.

Multiple genes can interaction with a number of environments in the development of cancer. The macroenvironment—our lifestyle, the air we breathe, the food we eat, the chemicals we are exposed to, as well as viruses, radiation, and physical agents we come in contact with—combines with the microenvironment of our cells to either prevent or enhance carcinogenesis.

### 3.2.2 Evidence for Genetic Contributions

**Family Studies and Hereditary Risk**

Family history is often one of the strongest risk factors for common disease complexes such as cancer. A person inherits a complete set of genes from each parent, as well as a vast array of cultural and socioeconomic experiences from his/her family. Family history is thought to be a good predictor of an individual's disease risk because family members most closely represent the unique genomic and environmental interactions that an individual experiences.

Shared environmental risk factors may contribute heavily to the familial occurrence of cancer, e.g., a familial habit of heavy smoking to the clustering of lung cancer, and they should be ascertained. A negative family history of cancer does not exclude a familial cancer syndrome for several reasons. Virtually none of the germline mutations involved in hereditary cancer have a 100% penetrance.

**High-Penetrance Cancer Susceptibility Genes**

Pathogenic variants in high-penetrance genes have been identified as the cause of inherited cancer risk in some colon cancer–prone families; these are estimated to account for only 5% to 6% of CRC cases overall. In addition, pathogenic variants in lower-penetrance genes may contribute to familial colon cancer risk.

Major genes are typically considered those that are involved in single-gene disorders, and the diseases caused by major genes are often relatively rare. Most pathogenic variants in major genes lead to a very high risk of disease, and environmental contributions are often difficult to recognize.

**Moderate and Low-Penetrance Variants**

The polymorphic susceptibility genes or genetic variants are generally associated with low penetrance and low relative and absolute risks, but they are very common in the population (more than 1 percent) and may be involved in a high proportion of cancers through biologic interactions with environmental or endogenous exposures.

### 3.2.3 Evidence for Environmental Contributions

**Migration Studies**

A growing body of knowledge dramatically illustrates the influence of the environment, genes, and their interactions in the international variation reported in cancer incidence. A variety of linkages clearly exist between environmental exposures, diet, lifestyle factors, and cancer.

**Population Attributable Fractions**

The population attributable fraction (PAF) is a standard measure used to quantify the proportion of disease burden attributable to a risk factor. It is calculated using information on the prevalence of a risk factor in a population and the relative risk that the risk factor poses for development of disease.

**Environmental Carcinogen Evidence**

The available epidemiologic evidence indicates that while environmental exposures drive the demographic patterns for most cancers, there are growing indications that gene variants may have a sizable impact on cancer development by modifying the effects of exogenous or endogenous risk factors.

### 3.2.4 Integrating Genetic and Environmental Factors

**Gene-Environment Interaction Research**

The study of gene-environment and gene-gene interactions represents a broad class of genetic association studies focused on understanding how human genetic variability is associated with differential responses to environmental exposures and with differential effects depending on variations in other genes.

Much of the work on identifying functional polymorphisms that influence an individual's cancer risk has focused on gene products involved in the activation and detoxification of carcinogens and, more recently, on DNA repair.

**Molecular Epidemiology Approaches**

Recent progress in identifying and characterizing highly penetrant susceptibility genes in familial cancer has revolutionized our understanding of the critical genetic mechanisms in cancer etiology. Studies that combine genetic analysis with assessment of exposures and diet can explain why not everyone exposed to a particular cancer-causing chemical will develop cancer.

## 3.3 Lifestyle-Associated Cancers

### 3.3.1 Tobacco Use

**Epidemiological Evidence**

Smoking accounts for at least 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 80 percent of lung cancer deaths. Lung cancer, for which smoking is the primary risk factor, is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. However, smoking heightens the risk of up to 18 types of cancers, including head and neck cancers, leukemia, and cancers of the esophagus, bladder, pancreas, kidney, liver, stomach, colorectum, cervix, uterus, and ovaries.

Tobacco, through its various forms of exposure, constitutes the main cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide among men, and increasingly among women. Forms of exposure include active smoking, breathing secondhand tobacco smoke (passive or involuntary smoking) and smokeless tobacco. The total death toll in 2005 from tobacco use was estimated at 5.4 million people, including about 1.5 million cancer deaths.

**Carcinogenic Mechanisms**

Cigarette smoke contains more than 7,000 compounds, at least 60 of which are known carcinogens. Inhaling this mix of chemicals through smoke induces tissue injury and changes in the cellular environment that foster proliferation and transformation into cancer cells.

There are more than 7,000 chemicals in combustible tobacco cigarette smoke, and more than 70 are established human carcinogens. In addition to combustible tobacco cigarette smoking, pipe and cigar smoking are established causes of lung cancer. Furthermore, even exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke, which results in much lower levels of smoke exposure than active smoking, is causally associated with lung cancer.

**Secondhand Smoke**

The risk of lung cancer in cigarette smokers is directly related to the number of cigarettes smoked. Among smokers, an increase in exposure leads to an increase in risk, as long as the additional tobacco smoke, whether through active or passive smoking, reaches the bronchial epithelium.

One meta-analysis of 5 cohort and 34 case-control studies found that nonsmoking women who lived with a smoker had an approximately 25 percent greater risk of developing lung cancer than non-smoking women who lived with a nonsmoker.

### 3.3.2 Physical Activity and Obesity

**Physical Activity and Cancer Risk**

Obesity increases the risk of breast, endometrial, colorectal, kidney, and esophageal cancer. Physical inactivity, dietary factors, obesity and being overweight play an important role as causes of cancer. Overweight and obesity are causally associated with several common cancer types, including cancers of the oesophagus, colorectum, breast in postmenopausal women, endometrium and kidney.

**Mechanisms**

Physical inactivity is a major contributor to the rise in rates of overweight and obesity in many parts of the world, and independently increases the risk of some cancers. Because all these factors are intimately interconnected at the individual and contextual levels, estimating the specific contribution of each of these risk factors is difficult and might underestimate the cumulative potential risk.

### 3.3.3 Diet and Nutrition

**Dietary Risk Factors**

Consumption of red meat and processed meat increases the risk of colorectal cancer by an estimated 43 percent. Another major dietary risk factor is high salt intake, which increases the risk of stomach cancer. Globally, salt intake has declined, and the associated cancer burden has declined as a result.

The global network of World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) International comprises registered charities in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands as well as the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) in the USA. The WCRF International network was the first organization to focus exclusively on the links between cancer and nutrition, and more recently physical activity.

**Nutritional Epidemiology**

Discoveries that both essential and nonessential dietary nutrients can markedly influence several key biological events—including cell cycle regulation, processes involved in replication or transcription, immunocompetence, and factors involved with apoptosis, or programmed cell death—have strengthened convictions that specific foods or components may markedly influence cancer risk.

## 3.4 Environmental and Occupational Cancer Risks

### 3.4.1 Environmental Carcinogens

**Environmental Pollution**

Environmental pollution of air, water and soil with carcinogenic chemicals accounts for 1–4% of all cancers. Exposure to carcinogenic chemicals in the environment can occur through drinking water or pollution of indoor and ambient air. In Bangladesh, 5–10% of all cancer deaths in an arsenic-contaminated region were attributable to arsenic exposure.

**Indoor Air Pollution**

Indoor air pollution from coal fires doubles the risk of lung cancer, particularly among non-smoking women. Worldwide, indoor air pollution from domestic coal fires is responsible for approximately 1.5% of all lung cancer deaths. Coal use in households is particularly widespread in Asia.

### 3.4.2 Occupational Carcinogens

**Occupational Exposures**

More than 40 agents, mixtures and exposure circumstances in the working environment are carcinogenic to humans and are classified as occupational carcinogens. That occupational carcinogens are causally related to cancer of the lung, bladder, larynx and skin, leukaemia and nasopharyngeal cancer is well documented. Mesothelioma (cancer of the outer lining of the lung or chest cavity) is to a large extent caused by work-related exposure to asbestos.

**High-Risk Occupations**

Examples of exposures that increase risk for hematologic malignancies include benzene (and other organic solvents), pesticides, radiation, and chemotherapy. The latency period between initial exposure and diagnosis of a secondary HM is 2 to 3 years for patients who were exposed to topoisomerase II inhibitors and 5 to 7 years for those who were exposed to alkylating agents or radiation therapy.

## 3.5 Cancer Health Disparities and Social Determinants

### 3.5.1 Conceptualizing Cancer Disparities

**Human Development and Cancer**

Human development plays a critical role in understanding the shifting scale and profile of cancer globally. The Human Development Index (HDI), with a four-tier categorization of countries as having low, medium, high, or very high HDI, provides a useful framework for assessing the global cancer burden geographically and over time.

**Epidemiological Transition**

Omran's theory of epidemiological transition focused on how changing health and disease patterns interact with societal, economic, and demographic factors. In the third stage of the transition, the model describes how chronic diseases increase as life expectancy rises beyond age 70 years and mortality from degenerative diseases is postponed to older ages.

### 3.5.2 Global Cancer Disparities

**Development Level Disparities**

When assessed by specific types of cancers, YLL was observed to be the main contributor to DALYs overall. In general, individuals in countries with higher HDI were observed to live a greater number of years with disability, whereas individuals in countries with lower HDI were observed to have a greater burden of premature mortality.

**Resource Disparities**

The developed countries are barely able to cope up with the exponential increase in the cancer-related services, and the current situation in developing countries, that is, low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) is much worse.

### 3.5.3 Healthcare Access and Cancer Disparities

**Healthcare System Factors**

Cancer genetics risk assessment and genetic counseling includes family history, psychosocial assessments, and education on hereditary cancer syndromes, testing, and risk. Individuals are considered to be candidates for cancer risk assessment if they have a personal and/or family history or clinical characteristics with features suggestive of hereditary cancer.

**Data and Surveillance Disparities**

Data on the medically underserved population are not usually included in cancer statistics reports. The information could be obtained by revision of the source documents to include the necessary data or by special studies. Implementation of the required changes will take time, but the revision of source documents would have a more permanent effect.

## Conclusion

The global cancer burden continues to evolve in response to demographic transitions, changing risk factor patterns, and varying levels of healthcare infrastructure. Changing fertility patterns and increasing life expectancy are leading to major changes in the scale of the cancer problem worldwide for populations at all levels of human development. A cancer transition is clearly underway in countries transiting to high levels of income and development whereby reductions in infection-related cancers are offset by concomitant increases in cancers linked to a "Westernization" of lifestyle.

Adequate surveillance mechanisms at the country level are needed to monitor progress. With a greater number of governments adopting national cancer control plans, attention is increasingly turning to population-based cancer surveillance data as a central component in prioritizing and evaluating interventions.

The evidence demonstrates that cancer remains a complex disease influenced by both genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, with the relative contributions varying by cancer type and population. The big challenge for epidemiology now is to develop strategies to ensure that the advances in human genomics are incorporated appropriately into population studies, as well as family-based, and hybrid studies. Understanding these patterns is crucial for developing effective, evidence-based cancer prevention and control strategies that address the diverse needs of populations worldwide.
