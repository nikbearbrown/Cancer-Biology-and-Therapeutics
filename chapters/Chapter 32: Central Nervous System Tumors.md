# Chapter 32: Central Nervous System Tumors

Central nervous system (CNS) tumors represent a diverse group of neoplasms that originate within the brain and spinal cord. These tumors present unique challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to their location within the anatomically complex and functionally critical nervous system. In 2018, cancer of the brain and central nervous system was the 17th most common cancer type, with an estimated 297,000 new cases worldwide. Understanding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical management of CNS tumors is essential for healthcare providers, as these conditions significantly impact patient quality of life and require specialized multidisciplinary care.

About 68% of all brain and central nervous system tumours are non-malignant; about half of these tumours are meningiomas, followed by pituitary tumours and nerve sheath tumours. Among the malignant tumours, heterogeneity is also substantial; almost half of these are glioblastomas, followed by other gliomas. This chapter focuses on the two most clinically significant CNS tumors: glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive primary brain tumor, and meningiomas, the most common non-malignant brain tumor.

## 32.1 Glioblastoma Multiforme

### 32.1.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) comprises glioma's most malignant and pervasive subtype. GBM is the most common primary brain tumor in adults, accounting for 45.2% of primary malignant brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors. There are an estimated 80,000 to 90,000 newly diagnosed cases of primary brain tumors each year in the United States, with approximately 25% being gliomas. The total number of glioblastoma cases diagnosed each year is about 12,000 (approximately 15% of the total of newly diagnosed brain tumors and roughly 50% of all malignant brain tumors).

**Age and Gender Distribution**:
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor. With an incidence rate of 3.19 per 100,000 persons in the United States and a median age of 64 years, it is uncommon in children. The incidence is 1.6 times higher in males compared to females and 2.0 times higher in Caucasians compared to Africans and Afro-Americans, with lower incidence in Asians and American Indians.

**Anatomical Distribution**:
GBM is commonly located in the supratentorial region (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes) and is rarely located in cerebellum. Overall, the incidence of GBM is higher in males than in females (3.97 vs. 2.53 in the United States).

**Risk Factors**:
The only well-established causative factor is exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation. Results from some epidemiological studies suggest that ionizing radiation can increase the chance of developing gliomas. Gliomas most often present in patients without any relevant history; however, some patients may have tumor-predisposition syndromes. The phacomatoses such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2 predispose patients to astrocytomas and ependymomas, respectively.

### 32.1.2 Pathophysiology and Molecular Biology

**Cellular Origin and Classification**:
Due to different triggering mutations and critical mutations in the GBM stem cells, GBM is classified into primary tumors arising from neural stem cell precursors and secondary tumors arising from mutations in mature neural cells like astrocytes. Glioblastoma is an extremely aggressive form of cancer most commonly derived from neural stem cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes that occurs in the brain and has a 5-year survival rate of 6.7%.

**Molecular Subtyping**:
The classification of GBM based on gene expression distinguishes between four subtypes: proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal. Aberrations and gene expression of EGFR, NF1, and PDGFRA/IDH1 define classical, mesenchymal, and proneural GBMs, respectively. Genes of normal brain cell types show a strong relationship between subtypes and different neural lineages and the response to aggressive treatment differs by subtype, with prominent benefits in the classical and little or no benefit in the proneural subtype.

**IDH Mutations**:
Interestingly, IDH1 mutations are also found in 80% of diffuse astrocytoma and anaplastic astrocytoma, the precursors of secondary GBM, and in less than 5% of primary GBM. According to the WHO 2021 recommendations for central nervous system tumors, astrocytomas are now diagnosed solely by IDH mutations. New to the 2021 recommendations, glioblastomas are now only IDH-wildtype tumors and no longer classified as IDH-mutant.

**Tumor Heterogeneity**:
Alteration in genetic information, causing expression and suppression of genes compared to their physiological levels in healthy brain cells, leads to cellular and extracellular matrix changes, resulting in a multiform number of biochemical forms. Hence, the name multiforme is due to the extent of genotypic diversity. Glioblastomas are complex heterogeneous tumors that have the ability to adapt and build resistance against existing treatments.

### 32.1.3 Clinical Presentation

**Symptom Categories**:
A thorough history of patients with astrocytoma is a critical component of the diagnostic process, providing valuable insights into symptoms' onset, progression, and nature. Symptoms can be divided into 2 categories: general and focal. General symptoms include headache (usually early morning), nausea, vomiting, cognitive difficulties, personality changes, and gait disorders. Localizing symptoms include seizures, aphasia, or visual field defects.

**Specific Manifestations**:
The most common symptoms of glioblastomas are loss of vision, numbness, and headaches, usually accompanied by nausea or vomiting. These symptoms may be overlooked or mistaken for another disease, which is why glioblastomas are commonly detected in later stages when they begin their widespread infiltration of the brain.

**Seizures and Neurological Deficits**:
About 50% of patients with supratentorial brain tumors may present with seizures. A visual field defect is often unnoticed by the patient and may be revealed after it leads to injury, such as motor vehicle accidents. Once the tumors have developed, 60% of patients experience short seizures, between 2–3 minutes of duration, and suffer from fatigue, confusion, and numbness once the seizure has concluded.

### 32.1.4 Diagnostic Approaches

**Imaging Characteristics**:
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows poorly circumscribed marginal enhancement. Central hypointensity in T1 due to necrosis and peripheral hyperintensities in T2/FLAIR sequences due to edema are salient MRI features. MR spectroscopy has a choline peak.

**Histopathological Diagnosis**:
The definitive diagnosis is made through a histopathological examination that reveals poorly differentiated pleomorphic cells. The differential diagnosis of GBM poses a significant challenge due to its overlapping clinical and radiological features with other brain tumors and non-neoplastic conditions.

**Multidisciplinary Evaluation**:
The urgency of neurosurgical evaluation depends on whether the patient is clinically stable, the symptoms' severity, and the tumor's size and location. Preoperative evaluation includes MRI and diffusion tensor imaging.

### 32.1.5 Treatment Strategies

**Surgical Management**:
The goal of surgery is the maximum safe resection to preserve neurological function with improved survival. Since GBM infiltrates surrounding structures, GTR is not always possible. Data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) suggest GTR and STR are associated with improved survival compared to biopsy alone or no surgical intervention.

In a multicenter trial including 314 patients who underwent resection of a newly diagnosed glioblastoma, the complete resection rate was similar for intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) or 5-aminolevulinic acid (81% and 78%, respectively). In a trial of iMRI versus conventional neuronavigation, iMRI use led to better PFS.

**Adjuvant Treatment**:
Current approved therapies include surgical resection followed by a combination of radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide, and more recently tumor-treating (TT) fields. GBM's gold-standard treatment comprises surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiochemotherapy.

**Chemotherapy**:
Temozolomide is an oral alkylating agent converted to 3-methyl-(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC) at physiologic pH. This agent is 100% bioavailable, and approximately 35% crosses the blood-brain barrier. Based on the CATNON trial, adjuvant treatment consists of 12 monthly cycles, beginning 1 month after radiotherapy completion.

**Treatment Challenges**:
However, there are many limitations with the current treatment strategies due to several resistance mechanisms varying from low concentrations of chemotherapeutics crossing the blood brain barrier to increased risk of temozolomide resistance in a sub-set of patients.

### 32.1.6 Prognosis and Complications

**Survival Outcomes**:
It remains an incurable disease with a median survival of 15 months and has been classified into wild-type and mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) subtypes. The average survival for patients is approximately 12–15 months, and relative survival is extremely low, with less than 5% of all patients surviving 5 years post-diagnosis, with this value decreasing to 2% among patients aged 65 years or older.

**Recurrence Patterns**:
Recurrence after GTR and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy mainly occurs within the peritumoral brain zone (PBZ) bearing the malignant microenvironment containing tumor cells, angiogenesis-related endothelial cells, reactive astrocytes, glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and glioma-associated stromal cells (GASCs). High local recurrence rates (80% to 90%) are observed within 2 cm of the original tumor.

**Treatment-Related Complications**:
GBM is usually associated with pseudoprogression or radionecrosis, which is a subacute worsening of MRI findings that occur within 3 months after the completion of chemoradiotherapy. It is a treatment-related effect. The risk of surgical site infection increases with irradiation and multiple surgeries.

### 32.1.7 Pediatric Considerations

**Epidemiology in Children**:
Glioblastoma in children, when compared with adults, is relatively rare. In contrast, GBM accounts for no more than 3–15% of primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors in children. This is despite the fact that CNS tumors are the most common solid tumors of childhood, and 40–50% of these tumors are constituted by the astrocytomas.

**Prognosis in Children**:
The reported median survival in p-GBM ranges from 13 to 73 months with a 5-year survival of less than 20%. A few reports, however, reveal a relatively better prognosis and long-term survival figures in p-GBM as compared with adults.

## 32.2 Meningiomas

### 32.2.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors

**Incidence and Demographics**:
Meningioma is a known benign central nervous system tumor commonly arising from the meninges of the brain and spinal cord. About 68% of all brain and central nervous system tumours are non-malignant; about half of these tumours are meningiomas, followed by pituitary tumours and nerve sheath tumours.

**Risk Factors**:
Although obesity has not been consistently associated with risk of glioma, there is a consensus that obesity is associated with risk of meningioma. Various genetic susceptibility loci have been identified for gliomas, and two distinct susceptibility loci have been associated with meningiomas.

**Ionizing Radiation**:
Ionizing radiation and the risk of brain and central nervous system tumors represents a well-established risk factor for meningioma development.

### 32.2.2 Pathophysiology and Classification

**Cellular Origin**:
Intraventricular meningiomas show similar characteristics to those found in the extra-axial space. Their cells of origin are the same; however, extra-axial meningiomas are derived from the arachnoid cap cells, naturally occurring near venous sinuses and dural edges. Intraventricular meningiomas originate from the choroid plexus' stroma and arise at the tela choroidea.

**WHO Grading System**:
Meningioma is classified into three grades, according to the World Health Organization. Most meningiomas are considered to be benign World Health Organization (WHO) grade I, slow-growing lesions.

**Grade I (Benign)**:
The majority of meningiomas are WHO Grade I tumors, characterized by slow growth and favorable prognosis with complete surgical resection.

**Grade II (Atypical)**:
Grade 2 are atypical lesions characterized by three or more of the following: necrosis, sheet-like growth, prominent nuclei, increased cellularity, or high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio. An increased mitotic activity (4-19 mitoses per 10 high-power fields) will also indicate an atypical tumor. A meningioma with brain invasion is now considered a grade 2 tumor.

**Grade III (Anaplastic)**:
Grade 3 are anaplastic, malignant lesions that can be similar to high-grade sarcomas, carcinoma, or melanomas with a high rate of distant metastases. A high mitotic activity (20 or more mitoses per 10 high-power fields) will also indicate a grade 3 lesion.

**Cystic Variants**:
Cystic meningioma represents a meningioma with intratumoral or peritumoral cysts. The classification system includes four types based on cyst location and characteristics.

### 32.2.3 Clinical Presentation

**Symptom Presentation**:
Since most patients with meningioma are asymptomatic, the management is usually done with close observation and follow-up with serial imaging. However, symptomatic patients usually require surgery to lower the risk of recurrence and severity of the disease.

**Location-Specific Symptoms**:
The clinical presentation of meningiomas depends significantly on their location within the CNS. Symptoms may include headaches, seizures, focal neurological deficits, or cognitive changes, depending on the anatomical structures affected.

**Optic Nerve Sheath Meningiomas**:
The natural history of ONSM is characterized by slowly painless and progressive visual loss in the affected eye. If left untreated, this tumor can lead to complete blindness. Visual loss, optic atrophy, and optociliary shunt vessels is the classic triad in patients with an ONSM but most patients do not present the three components.

### 32.2.4 Diagnostic Approaches

**Imaging Characteristics**:
Advanced neuroimaging plays a crucial role in meningioma diagnosis and surgical planning. MRI with gadolinium enhancement typically shows characteristic features that help distinguish meningiomas from other CNS tumors.

**Histopathological Confirmation**:
Prompt diagnosis, as well as understanding the severity of the tumor, would aid in the better future management of the patient. Tissue diagnosis through biopsy or surgical resection provides definitive histopathological classification.

**Molecular Markers**:
Pathology and molecular genetics of meningioma: recent advances have improved our understanding of meningioma biology and may influence treatment decisions.

### 32.2.5 Treatment Strategies

**Surgical Management**:
For most people, complete surgical resection (Simpson grade 1 or 2 resection) of a meningioma is considered optimal treatment. However for many people their tumour is inoperable due to location (an attempt at resection would result in significant neurological deficit) or in such a position that resection would be incomplete to avoid neurological sequelae.

**Observation Strategy**:
Active surveillance is appropriate in some circumstances. With the increasing use of sensitive neuroimaging tools, detection of asymptomatic low-grade meningiomas has increased; most appear to show minimal growth and can often be safely observed, with therapy deferred until the detection of tumor growth or the development of symptoms.

**Intraventricular Meningiomas**:
Small asymptomatic lesions <3cm are closely followed with brain MRI every six months for 1-2 years, and then once per year. For large asymptomatic lesions >3cm in young good surgical candidates, gross total resection is recommended as it is curative in most cases.

**Radiation Therapy**:
For these people the optimal timing of radiotherapy is unclear. In addition it is unclear if patients who have residual disease after surgical resection should have immediate adjuvant radiotherapy or wait until progressive growth occurs.

The committee therefore recommended that the radiotherapy technique selected should be the one which provides the least dose of radiation to the normal brain and the rest of the body, to reduce the risk of side effects of treatment, subject to that technique being appropriate in all other ways.

**Higher-Grade Meningiomas**:
The committee described how for higher-grade meningiomas the effectiveness of treatment decreased and they can regrow rapidly. The involvement of a comprehensive oncology team is necessary for malignant meningiomas to provide essential and amenable chemotherapies and radiation treatments.

### 32.2.6 Prognosis and Follow-up

**Recurrence Risk**:
The rate of recurrence and the risk of transformation to malignancy is dependent on the histopathological type of meningioma. Grade I meningiomas have excellent prognosis with complete resection, while higher-grade tumors carry increased risk of recurrence and malignant transformation.

**Surgical Outcomes**:
The recurrence and mortality are lower for intraventricular meningiomas than in other localizations. A higher complete surgical resection rate is achieved than in other localizations. Gross total resection is the gold standard for the treatment of intraventricular meningiomas.

**Complications**:
Many patients can present with deficits due to the tumor location. Postoperative reevaluation is needed as the surgical approach can cause new deficits. Some patients develop neurologic deficits primarily in visual fields.

## 32.3 Multidisciplinary Management

### 32.3.1 Team-Based Approach

**Neurosurgical Team**:
Formulating a treatment plan requires a multidisciplinary team, including surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists. This activity highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in the management of patients suffering from meningiomas.

**Specialized Expertise**:
Meningiomas involving the paranasal sinuses or the temporal bone may require an otorhinolaryngologist or a craniomaxillofacial surgeon. Moreover, since temporal bone meningiomas can cause hearing deficits, it is crucial to evaluate auditory function.

**Supportive Care**:
Dexamethasone, mannitol, and furosemide are used to treat the peritumoral edema associated with brain tumors. The use of anticonvulsants is mandatory for patients with seizures.

### 32.3.2 Advanced Techniques

**Surgical Technology**:
The use of functional brain mapping, diffusion tensor imaging, and tractography of white matter fiber tracts can help to select the best appropriate approach. Neuronavigation can be used to plan and verify the exact trajectory of the surgery.

**Adjuvant Interventions**:
Sometimes, complete resection can prove difficult due to vascular control being deep to the tumor, and pre-operative endovascular embolization should be attempted.

### 32.3.3 Patient Education and Counseling

**Informed Decision-Making**:
Clarifying patients' goals of care is essential as soon as the diagnosis is made, given the poor prognosis even with complete treatment. The patient should be educated about the management and prognosis of ONSMs as they are slowly progressive. Patients need to have clear information so they can make informed decisions about their tumors.

**Genetic Counseling**:
Offer genetic counseling for patients with a family history of brain tumors to assess potential hereditary risks.

## 32.4 Future Directions and Research

### 32.4.1 Molecular Therapeutics

**Targeted Therapy Development**:
In recent years, novel therapies and delivery systems have been developed to overcome these limitations. This therefore prompts the need for new therapies that have the capacity to target various pathways so that they remain effective against all subpopulations in the tumor.

**Immunotherapy**:
GBM shows features of immune escape and high tumor heterogeneity. Moreover, the relative immune privileged milieu owing to the lack of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and lymphatics within the CNS further contributes to the poor prognosis among cohorts with GBM.

### 32.4.2 Precision Medicine

**Molecular Classification**:
For decades, histologic diagnosis of these tumors provided a valuable foundation for assessing prognosis and guiding therapeutic management. The integration of molecular markers with traditional histopathological classification is revolutionizing CNS tumor diagnosis and treatment.

**Personalized Treatment**:
Molecular diagnosis will contribute to a better understanding and classification of brain tumors. Future therapeutic approaches will increasingly rely on molecular profiling to guide treatment decisions.

### 32.4.3 Prevention and Risk Reduction

**Lifestyle Modifications**:
Encourage healthy lifestyle choices, including proper nutrition and exercise, and avoid known risk factors like ionizing radiation exposure.

**Environmental Factors**:
Many potential risk factors have been studied, but most remain classified as "probably not risk factors". These include head injuries, occupational exposures, residential power-frequency electromagnetic fields, dental X-rays, tobacco smoke, and alcohol consumption.

## 32.5 Clinical Implications for Healthcare Providers

### 32.5.1 Early Recognition

**Symptom Awareness**:
Healthcare providers must maintain high clinical suspicion for CNS tumors in patients presenting with persistent headaches, new-onset seizures, focal neurological deficits, or cognitive changes. Early recognition and prompt referral are crucial for optimal outcomes.

**Imaging Considerations**:
Advanced neuroimaging plays a central role in CNS tumor diagnosis. Understanding the characteristic imaging features of different tumor types aids in differential diagnosis and treatment planning.

### 32.5.2 Prognostic Communication

**Glioblastoma Prognosis**:
This course aims to provide healthcare professionals with comprehensive insights into the current understanding of GBM, including its epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic approaches, and evolving therapeutic strategies.

**Meningioma Outcomes**:
Some patients demonstrate clinical stability despite tumor growth, and some patients have rapid vision loss even without an increase in tumor size. All patients should be encouraged to have clinical follow-up evaluations.

### 32.5.3 Interprofessional Collaboration

**Coordinated Care**:
Effectively managing astrocytoma cases requires an interprofessional approach involving physicians, advanced care practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, and other health professionals.

**Continuous Education**:
Physicians and advanced care practitioners must utilize advanced diagnostic skills and keep abreast of the latest treatment protocols, integrating evidence-based practices.

## Summary

Central nervous system tumors, particularly glioblastoma multiforme and meningiomas, represent significant challenges in modern oncology. Glioblastoma, as the most aggressive primary brain tumor, carries a devastating prognosis despite maximal therapeutic intervention, while meningiomas, though predominantly benign, can cause substantial morbidity due to their location and mass effect.

The management of CNS tumors requires a sophisticated understanding of neuroanatomy, tumor biology, and advanced treatment modalities. Multidisciplinary care involving neurosurgeons, oncologists, radiologists, and specialized nursing staff is essential for optimal patient outcomes. As our understanding of molecular mechanisms continues to evolve, personalized treatment approaches hold promise for improving outcomes in these challenging conditions.

Healthcare providers must remain vigilant for early signs of CNS tumors and understand the importance of prompt diagnosis and referral. The integration of advanced imaging techniques, molecular diagnostics, and novel therapeutic approaches continues to shape the future of CNS tumor management. Despite the challenges posed by these tumors, continued research and clinical innovation offer hope for improved outcomes and quality of life for patients affected by these conditions.
