# Chapter 20: Surgical Oncology

Surgery remains the cornerstone of cancer treatment and the most effective single modality for achieving cure in solid tumors. From its historical origins as the only available cancer treatment to its current role as a key component of multidisciplinary care, surgical oncology has undergone tremendous evolution in techniques, philosophy, and integration with other therapeutic modalities. Understanding the principles and practice of surgical oncology is essential for all healthcare professionals involved in cancer care.

## 20.1 Principles of Cancer Surgery

The principles underlying cancer surgery have evolved significantly over the past century, transitioning from radical ablative procedures to more conservative, function-preserving approaches while maintaining oncologic effectiveness.

### 20.1.1 Historical Evolution and Current Philosophy

**Historical Perspective:**
Over the years, the practice of surgical oncology has come full circle. Originally, surgeons attempted to treat cancer conservatively by removing only the gross lesion. Unfortunately, this led to extremely high rates of local recurrence and subsequent patient mortality. In the late nineteenth century, surgeons began to undertake complete en bloc resections and amputations to treat patients with malignant lesions. These techniques yielded improved results, but the procedures were ablative and mutilating.

**Modern Conservative Approach:**
With the advent of complementary and effective treatment modalities, notably radiation therapy in the 1920s and chemotherapy after the 1940s, the orientation of surgical resection is once again becoming conservative. Adjuvant chemotherapy, alone or in combination with radiation therapy, has improved disease-free survival and prolonged quality life for patients who have been rendered free of gross disease by surgery.

**Contemporary Role:**
Surgery is the oldest modality of cancer therapy and still forms the mainstay of treatment in solid tumors. It remains a paradigm that more patients are cured by surgery when it is used as a single treatment in comparison with any other individual form of cancer therapy.

### 20.1.2 Fundamental Principles of Surgical Oncology

#### Tissue Diagnosis Priority

**Essential Requirement:**
Surgical pathologists have the definitive role in tumor diagnosis. No matter how high the index of clinical suspicion, the diagnosis of cancer is not conclusively established nor safely assumed in the absence of a tissue diagnosis. With very few exceptions, definitive therapy for cancer should not be undertaken in the absence of a tissue diagnosis.

**Biopsy Considerations:**
The therapeutic approach in surgical mechanics is based on several principles: all lesions suspected to be neoplastic will be histologically examined. The pathologic interpretation of the tumor mass, regardless of the method used for biopsy, will provide essential information for treatment planning.

#### En Bloc Resection Principles

**Anatomical Considerations:**
Surgery is most effective in the treatment of localized primary tumor and associated regional lymphatics. This is accomplished by en bloc surgical procedures that attempt to encompass gross and microscopic tumor in all contiguous and adjacent anatomic locations.

**Margin Assessment:**
The basic surgical principles are removal of the major vascular pedicle feeding the tumor along with its lymphatics, obtaining a tumor-free margin, and en bloc resection of any organs or structures attached to the tumor. Excision margins should be identified and marked with ink prior to any dissection, thus permitting accurate measurement of these distances microscopically.

#### Multidisciplinary Integration

**Team Approach:**
To be maximally effective, the cancer surgeon must function as a member of the oncology team, and is frequently the first oncology specialist that a patient will consult. Because surgery is increasingly combined with other treatment modalities, it is essential that most patients with solid neoplasms have their treatment planned by a multidisciplinary team.

**Coordinated Care:**
The successful surgical oncologist must be able to coordinate and integrate the efforts of the entire oncologic team if the oncologist is to retain a primary role in the management of the cancer patient.

### 20.1.3 Role of the Surgical Oncologist

#### Scope of Practice

**Comprehensive Expertise:**
Surgical oncologists are surgeons who devote most of their time to the study and treatment of malignant neoplastic disease. They must possess the necessary knowledge, skills, and clinical experience to perform both the standard as well as extraordinary surgical procedures required for patients with cancer.

**Diagnostic Responsibilities:**
The cancer surgeon is commonly charged with the responsibility to establish a tissue diagnosis for a suspicious lesion, where it will be the surgeon's decision whether an operative procedure is needed versus an image-directed or other biopsy approach.

**Multidisciplinary Knowledge:**
Surgical oncologists must be able to diagnose tumors accurately and to differentiate aggressive neoplastic lesions from benign reactive processes. In addition, surgical oncologists should have a firm understanding of radiation oncology, medical oncology, and hematology.

#### Leadership Role

**Primary Care Function:**
Surgical oncologists have a shared role with medical oncologists as the "primary care physicians" of cancer treatment. The cancer surgeon will usually bear the responsibility for communicating the biopsy findings to the patient, completing the procedures needed to stage the patient's disease, and planning and executing the definitive surgical treatment.

**Educational Role:**
As part of the larger surgical community, the surgical oncologist is a critical conduit of cancer information to colleagues in general surgery and other surgical specialties. Because of their leading role in the initial diagnosis of cancer, surgical oncologists are also frequently in leadership roles in cancer prevention and screening programs.

### 20.1.4 Quality and Safety Considerations

#### Surgical Standards

**Quality Metrics:**
Wide variations exist globally in the quality and safety of surgical care. Quality issues are particularly concerning in the context of surgical treatment for cancer, where achieving adequate resection is fundamental to the success of the procedure.

**Incomplete Resection Impact:**
Inadequate surgical resection of tumors can significantly undermine the effectiveness of these procedures. Incomplete or inadequate breast cancer resection following lumpectomy or mastectomy has been reported at rates as high as 15â€“45 percent in some settings.

#### Risk Assessment

**Patient Selection:**
The mechanics of surgical intervention influences the cancer recovery rate much less than other factors, such as the tumor type, location, growth type, biological behavior, as well as the patient's general condition.

**Perioperative Considerations:**
Because of their high-risk nature, decisions about the indications for palliative surgical procedures are particularly difficult. For example, palliative surgery in the contexts of florid metastatic disease has a 20% to 30% perioperative mortality.

## 20.2 Types of Surgical Procedures

Surgical procedures in oncology serve different therapeutic goals depending on the stage of disease, patient condition, and treatment intent. Understanding these various approaches is essential for appropriate surgical planning.

### 20.2.1 Curative Resection

**Definition and Goals:**
Curative resection can only be used in the case of the absence of metastases, and the tumor is circumscribed, with the possibility of total excision. Surgery is more effective, less complex, and less costly when performed for early-stage or locally advanced cancer.

**Technical Principles:**
For right-sided tumors, the basic surgical principles include obtaining a tumor-free margin of at least 5 cm of normal bowel on either side of the tumor to minimize the possibility of an anastomotic recurrence. En bloc removal of involved structures may offer the only chance for cure.

**Lymph Node Management:**
The routine dissection of regional nodes in close proximity to the primary malignancy is recommended for most cancer types even when these structures are not clinically involved with tumor. At the present time, it is generally agreed that en bloc regional lymph node dissection is indicated for clinically demonstrable nodal involvement with metastatic tumor.

#### Examples of Curative Procedures

**Breast Cancer Surgery:**
Multiple landmark studies published in the last several decades have led to the transition from more radical options, such as radical mastectomy, towards breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Surgery is an essential component in the management of treatable breast cancer... evidence-based management of breast cancer has evolved to limit treatments to what is necessary but sufficient to allow tissue preservation and control of treatment-specific morbidity.

**Colorectal Cancer Surgery:**
Radical surgery with curative intent is the treatment of choice in the majority of colon cancers. True colonic mucosal recurrences are rare. More common are para-anastomotic recurrences reflecting possibly an inadequate lymphadenectomy.

### 20.2.2 Debulking Surgery (Cytoreductive Surgery)

**Definition and Rationale:**
Cytoreductive surgery results in a reduction of tumor cell pressure, so that other simultaneous therapeutic methods can be more effective. Thus, surgery improves the efficacy of adjuvant therapy by the mechanical reduction in the number of cells that will be treated.

**Clinical Applications:**
Surgery for residual disease is a special application of palliative surgery. Cytoreductive surgery may be of benefit provided that (1) other forms of effective treatment are available for use after surgery, and (2) that reduction of tumor bulk will enhance the effectiveness of these other treatment modalities.

#### Ovarian Cancer Cytoreduction

**Primary Debulking:**
Generally, surgical therapy is the initial treatment performed in most patients with epithelial ovarian cancer for histologic confirmation, staging, and tumor debulking, which will help guide adjunct treatments. The move towards extensive surgery has been coupled with a greater stringency as to what constitutes optimal cytoreduction; this is increasingly being defined as removal of all macroscopic disease.

**Interval Debulking Surgery:**
Interval debulking surgery (IDS) is usually performed after 2 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy so as to prevent the development of chemo-resistance. A number of studies have reported optimal cytoreduction rates comparable to best results achieved at primary surgery.

**Neoadjuvant Approach:**
Some patients with advanced-stage disease that is unlikely to be completely resected or unresectable may benefit from undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgical cytoreduction.

#### Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Management

**HIPEC Procedures:**
Treatment should be multimodal and include preoperative systemic chemotherapy, complete cytoreductive surgery, and intraabdominal hyperthermia combined with intraoperative chemotherapy. The complete surgical cytoreduction possible is decisive for the prognosis, which requires multiple organ resections in addition to a partial to subtotal parietal peritonectomy.

**Selection Criteria:**
To quantify the extent of peritoneal metastases and determine the feasibility of tumor reduction, a surgical variable is used (index of peritoneal carcinomatosis: PCI). Depending on the pathologies, there is a threshold value beyond which the procedure does not improve survival.

### 20.2.3 Palliative Surgery

**Definition and Goals:**
Palliative surgery aims to treat and prevent symptoms, to prolong the patient's comfortable life. Palliative surgery can significantly enhance the quality of life and allow patients to return home for end-of-life care.

**Treatment Philosophy:**
Palliative treatment should be provided within delivery platforms as close to patients' homes as possible. It should be made clear that the procedure is being done to improve the quality of life, rather than to extend it.

#### Common Palliative Procedures

**Obstruction Relief:**
Examples of indicated palliative surgical procedures include (1) colostomy, enteroenterostomy, or gastrojejunostomy to relieve obstruction... Palliative surgical procedures commonly required include mastectomy for bulky, fungating, or bleeding tumors and formation of a colostomy for obstructing colorectal tumors.

**Pain Management:**
Additional palliative procedures include (2) cordotomy to control pain; (4) amputation for intractably painful tumors of the extremities; (5) simple mastectomy for carcinoma of the breast, when the tumor is infected, large, ulcerated, and locally resectable, (even in the presence of distant metastases).

**Hemorrhage Control:**
Other procedures include (3) cystectomy to control hemorrhagic tumors of the bladder; (7) destruction of liver metastases by using radiofrequency ablation.

#### Risk-Benefit Considerations

**Patient Selection:**
Advanced disease has higher operative and postoperative risks; the risks and benefits of the procedure must be weighed carefully by providers and patients. The risk:benefit ratio and ultimate surgical objectives must be defined as clearly as possible and accepted by patient, family, and surgeon.

**Quality vs. Quantity:**
In other situations, when recovery is unlikely, palliative surgery can bring improvements for a time period and/or the prolongation of life. The procedure of tumor fighting can be successfully applied to tumors with slow development and low metastatic rate.

### 20.2.4 Prophylactic Surgery

**Indications:**
Preventive surgery can be applied by the excision of the benign, premalignant or in situ tumor, which prevents the possible onset of invasive malignancy. The old adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure certainly applies in solid-tumor oncology.

**Genetic Considerations:**
As the role of genetic mutations that predispose to subsequent cancer development expands, one can anticipate that prophylactic surgery will be extended to encompass these conditions. It is imperative that the surgical oncologist become intimately knowledgeable about the indications, limitations, and ethical considerations regarding genetic counseling.

**Risk-Reducing Procedures:**
Preventive surgery can be performed by the removal of tissues or organs that can contribute to the possible appearance of neoplasms or present a higher predictable malignization rate than normal.

## 20.3 Minimally Invasive Surgery

The development of minimally invasive surgical techniques has revolutionized cancer surgery by reducing morbidity while maintaining oncologic outcomes.

### 20.3.1 Principles of Minimally Invasive Surgery

**Definition:**
Minimally invasive (MI) surgery has been described as a discipline that involves a novel way to perform operative procedures with the main goal of decreasing the sequelae of traditional surgery.

**Benefits:**
The primary reasons for adopting this minimally invasive technique are to reduce surgical trauma, facilitate quicker postoperative recovery, and lower the risk of surgical wounds and other hospital-acquired infections.

**Implementation:**
Such procedures can now be frequently performed on an outpatient basis by using minimally invasive technology such as laparoscopic surgical approaches.

### 20.3.2 Laparoscopic Oncology

#### Colorectal Applications

**Clinical Evidence:**
In earlier trials, there was no difference in outcome, staging, number of lymph nodes resected, and survival between open versus laparoscopic colectomy. In a prospective randomized single-institution study, at a median followup of 43 months, investigators reported an improved cancer-related survival in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.

**Technical Considerations:**
The principles of surgical management of both colon and rectal adenocarcinoma are basically the same whether performed open or laparoscopically. However, the surgical management for colon and rectal cancer require special considerations for each approach.

#### Gynecologic Applications

**Endometrial Cancer:**
Twenty-two studies involving a total of 4420 patients showed that robotic surgery is generally safer and more reliable than laparoscopy and laparotomy for patients with endometrial cancer. The estimated blood loss and number of conversions were significantly lower in robotic surgery than in laparoscopy.

**Ovarian Cancer:**
Comparison of efficacy of robotic surgery, laparoscopy, and laparotomy in the treatment of ovarian cancer showed varying results depending on the specific outcomes measured, with each approach having distinct advantages.

### 20.3.3 Robotic Surgery

#### Technical Advantages

**Enhanced Precision:**
Robotic surgery provides several potential advantages including enhanced dexterity, improved visualization, and reduced surgeon fatigue. The robotic approach may be particularly beneficial for complex reconstructive procedures.

**Learning Curve:**
The definition of the robotic approach was heterogeneous since the technique was defined as robotic, robotic-assisted, robot-assisted laparoscopic, combining sequentially different approaches.

#### Clinical Outcomes

**Pancreatic Surgery:**
A systematic review on robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy showed increasing utilization over time. The overall procedure failure (rates of conversion to open surgery) was 14%. The overall morbidity rate was 58% and the reoperation rate was 7.3%.

**Comparative Effectiveness:**
Robotic surgery is associated with significantly lower estimated blood loss than both laparoscopy and laparotomy; fewer conversions but more complications than laparoscopy; and shorter length of hospital stay, fewer complications, and fewer transfusions but a longer operative time than laparotomy.

### 20.3.4 Specialized Minimally Invasive Techniques

#### Transanal Microsurgery

**Applications:**
Rectal microsurgery is a form of minimally invasive surgery used in the treatment of early rectal cancers, defined as an adenocarcinoma invading the rectal wall up to the submucosa. For malignant lesions, local excision using transanal microsurgery is accepted for T1N0 rectal cancers.

**Advantages:**
Transanal microsurgery offers an oncologic cure without compromising bowel function. This technique addresses the limitations of traditional transanal excision by providing better exposure and visibility.

#### Image-Guided Procedures

**Biopsy Techniques:**
Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are all useful techniques for localizing lesions at the time of invasive biopsy. However, while image-directed needle biopsy may be useful in some patients, exploratory surgery is often required to obtain a definitive biopsy.

**Intraoperative Navigation:**
The surgical treatment of breast cancer requires precise localization. Non-radioactive devices include the SCOUT RADAR device, MAGSEED, and RFIL, which allow for deployment up to thirty days before surgery.

## 20.4 Reconstructive Surgery

Reconstructive surgery plays an increasingly important role in cancer care, allowing for restoration of form and function while maintaining oncologic principles.

### 20.4.1 Principles of Oncoplastic Surgery

**Integration with Cancer Treatment:**
The role of reconstructive surgery as a part of the multimodality care of the oncology patient has become increasingly important. During the operation, enhanced awareness of tumor extent may indicate that an alteration is needed in the initial operative plan.

**Timing Considerations:**
Surgical treatment may occur after pretreatment with systemic agents (neoadjuvant) or as part of reconstruction (oncoplastic resection). Primary reconstruction of the breast is often performed at the time of mastectomy.

### 20.4.2 Breast Reconstruction

#### Immediate vs. Delayed Reconstruction

**Immediate Reconstruction:**
Primary reconstruction of the breast is often performed at the time of mastectomy. The specific treatment regimens for breast cancer are currently directed by multidisciplinary teams involving integration of surgical oncologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, plastic surgeons, and rehabilitation specialists.

**Patient Selection:**
In younger patients with stage I and low-grade ovarian cancers who desire fertility-sparing surgery, surgical staging with uterine preservation may be considered, highlighting the importance of individualized approaches to reconstruction.

#### Reconstructive Techniques

**Autologous Reconstruction:**
Various techniques are available for breast reconstruction using the patient's own tissue, providing natural results but requiring more extensive surgery.

**Implant-Based Reconstruction:**
Prosthetic reconstruction offers a less invasive option but may require multiple stages and has different considerations for patients receiving radiation therapy.

### 20.4.3 Head and Neck Reconstruction

**Complex Defects:**
Head and neck cancer surgery often results in significant functional and aesthetic deficits requiring sophisticated reconstructive techniques to restore speech, swallowing, and appearance.

**Microvascular Reconstruction:**
Free tissue transfer has revolutionized reconstruction of complex head and neck defects, allowing for restoration of both form and function.

### 20.4.4 Functional Restoration

#### Lymphatic Reconstruction

**Lymphedema Prevention:**
For patients requiring lymph node dissection, lymphatic reconstruction procedures may be part of the initial operation (lymph-venous reconstruction), addressing the long-term complications of cancer treatment.

**Rehabilitation Integration:**
Post-surgical morbidity has become an increasing focus of concern as more patients survive breast cancer with modern therapy. Cancer rehabilitation can be broadly defined as the maximum restoration of physical, psychologic, social, vocational, recreational, and economic functions within the limits imposed by the malignancy and its treatment.

#### Prosthetic Integration

**Limb Salvage:**
For example, breast-preserving surgery has become an alternative to mastectomy in patients with breast carcinoma; limb salvage is often possible in patients with bone and soft-tissue sarcomas; and sexual potency/urinary continence can frequently be preserved for patients with prostate cancer.

**Quality of Life Considerations:**
The prosthetic candidacy may be affected by numerous factors, including associated medical conditions, other physical disabilities, life expectancy, muscle strength and coordination, stamina, various psychological factors, and individual lifestyle factors.

### 20.4.5 Innovation in Reconstructive Techniques

#### Advanced Materials

**Biocompatible Materials:**
Development of new prosthetic materials and techniques continues to improve outcomes for patients requiring reconstruction after cancer surgery.

**Tissue Engineering:**
Emerging technologies in tissue engineering offer promise for more natural reconstruction options in the future.

#### Multidisciplinary Coordination

**Team Approach:**
The surgical treatment requires the contribution of a comprehensive interprofessional care team. Some surgeons also elect to have pathology verify margins intra-operatively, ensuring oncologic adequacy while planning reconstruction.

**Coordinated Care:**
A radiologist must be available in coordination with the surgeon's schedule to verify the specimen contains any biopsy clip, seed, or complete intact wire. This approach ensures the removal of the target lesion before the completion of surgery and reconstruction.

## Conclusion

Surgical oncology continues to evolve as a sophisticated discipline that balances oncologic effectiveness with functional preservation and quality of life. The integration of minimally invasive techniques, precision medicine approaches, and advanced reconstructive methods has transformed the field while maintaining its fundamental goal of curing cancer.
