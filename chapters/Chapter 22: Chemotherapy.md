# Chapter 22: Chemotherapy

## 22.1 Principles of Chemotherapy: Mechanism of Action

### 22.1.1 Historical Development and Basic Principles

The term "chemotherapy" was coined by German chemist Paul Ehrlich, who investigated the use of drugs to treat infectious diseases and was the first scientist to study animal models to screen chemicals for potential activity against diseases. The development of cancer chemotherapy began with three pivotal events in the last century: the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen, the use of transplantable animal-tumor models in cancer research, and the first surgical procedure developed by Halsted (radical mastectomy).

Historical documents suggest the use of arsenicals started in the 1900s, with radiotherapy and surgery being the mainstays of cancer management in the 1960s. As micrometastases and the recurrence of cancer after surgery and radiation therapy became evident, combination chemotherapy started gaining significance. The publication of the Lindskog article suggesting nitrogen mustard's success in treating lymphoma had a considerable initial effect on the development of cancer chemotherapy, including oral derivatives like chlorambucil and, ultimately, cyclophosphamide.

### 22.1.2 Fundamental Mechanisms of Cytotoxicity

Chemotherapy aims to inhibit cell proliferation and tumor multiplication, thus avoiding invasion and metastasis. Traditional chemotherapy agents primarily affect either macromolecular synthesis and function of neoplastic cells by interfering with DNA, RNA, or protein synthesis or affecting the appropriate functioning of preformed molecules.

**Direct Cytotoxic Effects:**
When interference in macromolecular synthesis or function is sufficient, it leads to cell death due to the chemotherapeutic agent's direct effect or by triggering apoptosis. With traditional agents, cell death may be delayed as many cells die due to a given treatment, requiring repeated administration to achieve a response.

**Cell Cycle Specificity:**
The toxicity of cytotoxic drugs is most significant during the S phase, as it is the DNA synthetic phase of the cell cycle. Vinca alkaloids and Taxanes act in the M phase and block mitotic spindle formation. The concept of cell cycle specificity has led to the classification of drugs based on their preferential destruction effect in different phases of the cell cycle.

### 22.1.3 Combination Chemotherapy Principles

Combination chemotherapy is based on three fundamental principles that guide treatment design:

**Fraction Kill Hypothesis:**
A uniform drug dose kills a constant fraction of tumor cells rather than a constant number regardless of tumor burden. This concept suggests that multiple cycles of treatment are necessary to achieve maximal tumor cell kill.

**Linear Dose-Response Relationship:**
Neoplastic tumor cells have a linear response between the dose and efficacy, indicating that higher doses (within tolerable limits) may provide greater therapeutic benefit.

**Goldie-Coldman Hypothesis:**
Cancer cells acquire spontaneous mutations that cause drug resistance. Therefore, multitargeted or combination therapy is superior to single-agent therapy in most cancer treatments. Additionally, combination chemotherapy agents with different mechanisms of action and nonoverlapping toxicities can be chosen to decrease resistance and toxicities.

### 22.1.4 Cellular Targets and Mechanisms

Inhibition of tumor growth can occur at several levels within the cell and its environment. The mechanisms of cell kill of several antineoplastic drugs involve interactions between the drug and essential intracellular enzymes, resulting in alteration or inhibition of normal functions. These cellular mechanisms that promote or suppress cell proliferation and differentiation are intricate, involving several genes, receptors, and signal transduction pathways.

**DNA as Primary Target:**
Most chemotherapeutic agents ultimately target DNA replication, transcription, or repair processes. The drugs can cause direct DNA damage, interfere with DNA synthesis, or disrupt the cellular machinery responsible for DNA maintenance.

**Apoptosis Induction:**
Many chemotherapeutic agents trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis) through various pathways, including p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. The ability to induce apoptosis is crucial for the therapeutic efficacy of many anticancer drugs.

## 22.2 Classes of Chemotherapeutic Agents

### 22.2.1 Alkylating Agents

Alkylating agents were the first nonhormonal drugs to be used effectively in the treatment of cancer. The development of these agents began with the observation that troops and civilians exposed to sulfur mustard during World War I developed bone marrow suppression and lymphoid aplasia, leading to the evaluation of related nitrogen mustards as antitumor agents.

**Mechanism of Action:**
These drugs yield an unstable alkyl group (R-CH2+) that reacts with nucleophilic centers on proteins and nucleic acids. Alkylating agents substitute alkyl groups for hydrogen atoms on DNA, resulting in the formation of cross-links within the DNA chain and thereby causing cytotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic effects. This action occurs in all cells, but alkylating agents have their primary effect on rapidly dividing cells which do not have time for DNA repair.

**Classification and Examples:**
- **Nitrogen mustards:** bendamustine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide
- **Nitrosoureas:** carmustine, lomustine  
- **Platinum analogs:** carboplatin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin
- **Triazenes:** dacarbazine, procarbazine, temozolomide
- **Alkyl sulfonates:** busulfan
- **Ethyleneimines:** thiotepa

**Clinical Applications:**
The alkylating agents are used across a wide spectrum of malignancies. Cisplatin, for example, is FDA approved for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, testicular cancer, and bladder carcinoma, and is frequently used off-label for numerous other malignancies.

### 22.2.2 Antimetabolites

Antimetabolites are structural analogs of naturally occurring metabolites involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. The development of pyrimidine and purine analogs as potential antineoplastic agents evolved from the early presumption that nucleic acids are involved in growth control.

**Mechanism of Action:**
Antimetabolites inhibit DNA replication by interfering with nucleotide synthesis or by being incorporated into DNA or RNA, causing chain termination or miscoding. They act as "false" substrates for enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism.

**Major Subclasses:**

**A) Folate Antagonists:**
- **Examples:** methotrexate, pemetrexed
- **Mechanism:** Inhibit dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of dihydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate, the active form of folic acid. Tetrahydrofolate is necessary to synthesize nucleotides of both DNA and RNA.
- **Clinical Use:** Methotrexate for ALL, NHL, CNS tumors, sarcoma; pemetrexed for malignant pleural mesothelioma, NSCLC (non-squamous)

**B) Purine Analogs:**
- **Examples:** cladribine, clofarabine, fludarabine, nelarabine, pentostatin
- **Mechanism:** Structural analogs of guanine and adenine that act as false metabolites
- **Clinical Use:** Cladribine for hairy cell leukemia; fludarabine for CLL; nelarabine for T-ALL

**C) Pyrimidine Analogs:**
- **Examples:** fluorouracil (5-FU), capecitabine, cytarabine, gemcitabine
- **Mechanism:** Cytarabine is converted into the triphosphate form within the cell and competes with cytidine to incorporate itself into DNA, causing DNA replication to cease. 5-FU's active metabolite forms a stable covalent complex with thymidine synthetase.
- **Clinical Use:** 5-FU for colorectal, anal, pancreatic, gastric cancers; cytarabine for AML; gemcitabine for pancreatic, lung, breast, ovarian cancers

### 22.2.3 Topoisomerase Inhibitors

Topoisomerase I and II are normal host enzymes found in the nucleus of mammalian cells and are required for normal DNA replication and cellular division. These enzymes create and then repair single-stranded nicks in cellular DNA, allowing for the untangling and relaxation of supercoiled double-stranded DNA so that replication can proceed.

**Topoisomerase I Inhibitors:**
- **Examples:** irinotecan, topotecan
- **Mechanism:** Prevent relegation by blocking the release of topoisomerase I from the cleavable complex, forming a ternary complex that prevents resealing of DNA breaks
- **Clinical Use:** Irinotecan for colorectal, cervical, esophageal, pancreatic, lung cancers; topotecan for cervical, ovarian, small cell lung cancer
- **Derivation:** Derived from camptothecins, cytotoxic compounds initially isolated from the bark of the Chinese tree, Camptotheca acuminata

**Topoisomerase II Inhibitors:**
- **Examples:** etoposide, teniposide (epipodophyllotoxins); doxorubicin, daunorubicin (anthracyclines)
- **Mechanism:** Bind to topoisomerase II and DNA, preventing the resealing of DNA breaks and thus causing inhibition of DNA replication and cell death
- **Clinical Use:** Etoposide for testicular cancer, small cell lung cancer, lymphomas; anthracyclines for leukemias, lymphomas, breast cancer, sarcomas
- **Derivation:** Epipodophyllotoxins are semisynthetic derivatives of podophyllotoxin, an extract from the American mandrake plant

### 22.2.4 Antimicrotubule Agents

These agents target the microtubule system, which is essential for cell division, intracellular transport, and maintenance of cell shape.

**Taxanes:**
- **Examples:** paclitaxel, docetaxel, cabazitaxel
- **Mechanism:** Disrupt the equilibrium of polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules, causing abnormal cellular function and disruption of replication leading to apoptosis. They stabilize microtubules and inhibit their disassembly.
- **Clinical Use:** Paclitaxel for breast, lung, ovarian cancers; docetaxel for breast, lung, prostate, ovarian cancers

**Vinca Alkaloids:**
- **Examples:** vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine
- **Mechanism:** Bind to tubulin, inhibit microtubule formation, and arrest cells in metaphase (M-phase specific)
- **Clinical Use:** Vincristine for ALL, Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL, neuroblastoma; vinblastine for lymphomas, testicular cancer

### 22.2.5 Antitumor Antibiotics

These naturally occurring compounds were originally isolated from various microorganisms and have been found to have significant antineoplastic activity.

**Examples:** actinomycin D, bleomycin, daunomycin, doxorubicin, mitomycin
**Mechanism:** Inhibit RNA and DNA synthesis through various mechanisms including DNA intercalation, generation of free radicals, and DNA strand breaks
**Clinical Applications:** Bleomycin for testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck cancers; doxorubicin for various solid tumors and hematologic malignancies

## 22.3 Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics

### 22.3.1 Drug Administration and Absorption

Chemotherapy agents can be administered orally, intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intrathecally. Most chemotherapy agents are administered intravenously because of their 100% absorption rate. Some compounds, like paclitaxel, are poorly soluble and need to be mixed with solvents like cremophor for better absorption.

**Factors Affecting Absorption:**
- Surgical procedures and gastric motility, especially important in cancer patients using opioids
- First-pass metabolism (significant for oral agents like cytarabine)
- Drug formulation and delivery systems

### 22.3.2 Distribution and Metabolism

Most chemotherapy agents are metabolized and excreted by the liver or kidneys. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system metabolizes various chemotherapeutic drugs. Drugs like bortezomib, docetaxel, etoposide, imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, and vinca alkaloids are metabolized by CYP3A4/5.

**Dosing Considerations:**
Chemotherapy agents are generally administered using body surface area dosing, which accounts for individual patient variations in size and metabolic capacity. Dose adjustments are essential for patients with organ dysfunction, particularly hepatic or renal impairment.

### 22.3.3 Drug-Drug Interactions

Drug-drug interactions are common and clinically significant in chemotherapy. It is imperative to be aware of common drugs that are strong inducers (like phenobarbital and phenytoin) and inhibitors of CYP enzymes (like grapefruit juice and ketoconazole), since these can alter drug levels and either decrease efficacy or increase toxicity.

**Transport Mechanisms:**
Many chemotherapeutic agents rely on specific transport systems for cellular uptake. For example, methotrexate utilizes folate transport systems, and resistance can develop through downregulation of these uptake mechanisms.

### 22.3.4 Pharmacokinetic Principles

**Tissue Pharmacology:**
For anticancer drugs, tissue pharmacology is much more relevant than plasma studies, and blood studies cannot be easily extrapolated to what occurs at the tissue level. The critical factor is the concentration × time (C×T) of the active drug at the level of tumor cells, not necessarily plasma C×T.

**Elimination Pathways:**
Different chemotherapeutic agents have varying elimination pathways:
- Renal elimination: requires dose adjustment in kidney disease (e.g., cisplatin, methotrexate)
- Hepatic metabolism: requires dose adjustment in liver disease (e.g., doxorubicin, paclitaxel)
- Biliary excretion: important for some agents like irinotecan

## 22.4 Drug Resistance

### 22.4.1 Types of Drug Resistance

Drug resistance represents one of the major challenges in cancer chemotherapy and can be classified into several categories:

**Intrinsic vs. Acquired Resistance:**
- **Intrinsic resistance:** Natural resistance of tumor cells against chemotherapeutic drugs at the onset of treatment
- **Acquired resistance:** Development of resistance during cancer treatment, where tumor cells initially sensitive to the drug develop resistance

**Primary vs. Secondary Resistance:**
- **Primary resistance:** Resistance before drug exposure
- **Secondary resistance:** Resistance after exposure to a drug

### 22.4.2 Mechanisms of Drug Resistance

Multiple mechanisms contribute to chemotherapy resistance, often operating simultaneously within the same tumor:

**Altered Drug Transport:**
- **Decreased uptake:** Downregulation of drug influx mechanisms, such as the reduced folate carrier for methotrexate
- **Increased efflux:** Overexpression of drug efflux pumps, particularly P-glycoprotein (MDR1), which belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily

**Drug Metabolism Alterations:**
- **Decreased activation:** Reduced conversion of prodrugs to active metabolites
- **Increased inactivation:** Enhanced drug detoxification through enzymes like glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)

**Target Alterations:**
- **Quantitative changes:** Altered expression levels of drug targets (e.g., increased dihydrofolate reductase in methotrexate resistance)
- **Qualitative changes:** Mutations in drug targets that reduce drug binding affinity

**DNA Repair Enhancement:**
Enhanced DNA repair mechanisms can counteract drug-induced DNA damage. Elevated expressions of repair system genes are often associated with chemotherapy resistance and represent potential molecular targets for overcoming resistance.

**Apoptosis Inhibition:**
- **Anti-apoptotic proteins:** Overexpression of proteins like Bcl-2 that prevent programmed cell death
- **Cell death pathway disruption:** Alterations in p53 and other apoptosis-regulating pathways

### 22.4.3 Multidrug Resistance (MDR)

Multidrug resistance refers to the simultaneous resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action. This phenomenon is particularly problematic in cancer treatment as it can render multiple therapeutic options ineffective.

**Classic MDR:**
Mediated primarily by P-glycoprotein overexpression, which pumps various structurally unrelated drugs out of the cell, including anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, and taxanes.

**Atypical MDR:**
Involving other transport proteins such as multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which have different substrate specificities.

### 22.4.4 Clinical Implications and Strategies

**Tumor Heterogeneity:**
The Goldie-Coldman hypothesis states that every tumor cell has a variable degree of resistance directly proportional to the tumor size. This concept explains why combination chemotherapy is often more effective than single-agent therapy.

**Resistance Prevention Strategies:**
- Use of combination chemotherapy with different mechanisms of action
- Alternating or sequential treatment regimens
- Dose intensification within tolerable limits
- Development of resistance modulators or chemosensitizers

## 22.5 Side Effects and Supportive Care

### 22.5.1 General Principles of Chemotherapy Toxicity

Chemotherapeutic agents are commonly associated with side effects that usually reflect their mechanism of action. Cytotoxic chemotherapy targets DNA and protein expression in both cancer and normal host cells, resulting in a very narrow therapeutic index. Most chemotherapy drugs show activity in rapidly multiplying cells, affecting bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, and hair follicles.

**Classification of Toxicities:**
- **Acute toxicities:** Occur within days to weeks of treatment

## 22.6 Conclusion and Clinical Significance

### 22.6.1 Evolution of Cancer Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy has transformed cancer from a terminal and catastrophic disease to a treatable and sometimes curable illness through the right approach. The field has evolved from empirical use of cytotoxic agents to sophisticated understanding of molecular mechanisms, leading to more targeted and effective treatments.

### 22.6.2 Principles of Rational Drug Design

The success of chemotherapy depends on several fundamental principles:

**Selective Toxicity:**
The goal is to achieve maximum tumor cell kill while minimizing damage to normal tissues. This requires understanding the differences between cancer cells and normal cells in terms of growth rate, metabolic pathways, and DNA repair capacity.

**Combination Therapy:**
The use of multiple agents with different mechanisms of action and non-overlapping toxicities has proven superior to single-agent therapy in most settings. This approach helps prevent the development of resistance and allows for dose optimization.

**Optimal Scheduling:**
The timing and sequence of drug administration can significantly impact efficacy and toxicity. Concepts such as synchronization, recruitment, and protection of normal tissues guide treatment scheduling.

### 22.6.3 Contemporary Clinical Applications

**Neoadjuvant Therapy:**
Treatment given before primary therapy to reduce tumor size and improve surgical outcomes or to assess treatment response.

**Adjuvant Therapy:**
Treatment given after primary therapy to eliminate micrometastatic disease and prevent recurrence. This approach is now standard for breast, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancers.

**Combined Modality Therapy:**
Integration of chemotherapy with surgery and radiation therapy has improved outcomes in many tumor types, including head and neck cancers, lung cancer, and anal cancer.

### 22.6.4 Future Directions

**Personalized Medicine:**
The identification of predictive biomarkers and genetic signatures will allow for more individualized treatment selection, optimizing efficacy while minimizing toxicity.

**Resistance Mechanisms:**
Continued research into mechanisms of drug resistance will lead to the development of novel strategies to overcome or prevent resistance, including combination approaches and resistance modulators.

**Drug Delivery Systems:**
Advances in nanotechnology and targeted delivery systems promise to improve the therapeutic index of chemotherapy by increasing drug concentration at tumor sites while reducing systemic exposure.

### 22.6.5 Multidisciplinary Care

The complexity of modern chemotherapy requires a multidisciplinary approach involving:

- **Medical oncologists:** Treatment planning and administration
- **Pharmacists:** Drug preparation and interaction monitoring
- **Nurses:** Patient education, monitoring, and supportive care
- **Supportive care specialists:** Management of treatment-related complications

### 22.6.6 Quality and Safety Considerations

Given the narrow therapeutic index of most chemotherapeutic agents, quality assurance and safety protocols are essential:

- **Standardized protocols:** To reduce errors in dosing and administration
- **Double-checking procedures:** For dose calculations and drug preparation
- **Monitoring systems:** For early detection of adverse effects
- **Education programs:** For all healthcare providers involved in chemotherapy administration

The field of chemotherapy continues to evolve rapidly, with new agents and treatment strategies being developed based on improved understanding of cancer biology and drug mechanisms. Success in chemotherapy depends on the careful balance between maximizing antitumor efficacy and minimizing treatment-related toxicity, requiring ongoing collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and supportive care teams to optimize outcomes for cancer patients.
