# Chapter 37: Cancer Survivorship

## Introduction

Cancer survivorship represents one of the most significant healthcare achievements of the 21st century, with the number of cancer survivors continuing to increase worldwide due to improvements in early detection, treatment advances, and an aging population. More than 16.9 million Americans (8.1 million males and 8.8 million females) with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2019; this number is projected to reach more than 22.1 million by January 1, 2030 based on the growth and aging of the population alone. Globally, there are currently 33 million cancer survivors worldwide. With improvements in early cancer detection and treatments, patients are living longer - and it is well-recognized that many survivors develop short- and long-term physical, psychosocial and spiritual effects as a result of their diagnoses and treatments.

The Institute of Medicine's landmark 2006 report "From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition" fundamentally changed how healthcare providers and policymakers view cancer survivorship, recognizing that survivors face significant risks for physical, psychosocial, and financial consequences from cancer and its treatment. This growing recognition has led to the development of survivorship as a distinct phase of the cancer care continuum.

The definition of survivorship itself remains complex and multifaceted. As defined by the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship (NCCS), survivorship begins at the time of diagnosis and continues throughout the life of a person with cancer. This broad definition acknowledges that the challenges and needs of cancer survivors begin immediately upon diagnosis and evolve throughout their cancer journey.

## Long-Term Side Effects of Treatment

Cancer survivors face an extensive array of potential long-term and late effects from their treatment, affecting virtually every organ system. Based on longitudinal and cross-sectional evidence, cancer survivors can experience symptoms for more than 10 years following treatment. These symptoms were present in survivors of all four cancer types who underwent a wide variety of treatment. Research demonstrates that as many as two-thirds of survivors will experience a late effect of chemotherapy or radiation, defined as any chronic or late occurring outcome—physical or psychosocial—that persists or develops beyond five years from the diagnosis of the cancer.

### Physical Late Effects

The spectrum of physical late effects is extensive and multifaceted, affecting multiple physiological systems. Research shows that other physical problems in addition to a patient's primary cancer also contribute to the mortality risk of long-term cancer survivors: An analysis of late mortality in approximately 700 patients diagnosed as adults with Hodgkin's lymphoma indicated that by about 23 years after a cancer diagnosis, the risk of death from the original cancer was exceeded by deaths due to cardiac disease, second cancers, and other problems.

#### Cardiovascular Complications

Cardiovascular effects represent one of the most significant concerns for long-term survivors, particularly those treated with cardiotoxic therapies. Studies show a marked elevation in risk of coronary artery disease among both men and women treated with mediastinal radiotherapy. The risk for women aged 35, 45, and 50 is as high as for men of the same age, and there is a one in five chance of having symptomatic coronary artery disease by 20 years following moderate dose radiation to the mediastinal area.

For breast cancer survivors, cardiovascular comorbidities are particularly prevalent. Among women aged 50 and older with estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer, the probability of dying from breast cancer is relatively low and the risk of dying from other causes increases over time. These deaths are largely attributable to aging and often a common insulin-resistance pathway that leads to both cardiovascular disease and breast cancer.

#### Second Primary Cancers

The development of subsequent malignancies represents a major long-term concern for cancer survivors. One out of every five new cancers diagnosed in the United States is a second, third, or fourth cancer for the patient. The factors contributing to a subsequent primary cancer include unhealthy behaviors (e.g., tobacco use, sedentary lifestyle, obesity), aging (patients 65 and older account for two-thirds of cancers), genetic factors, treatment exposures from the first cancer, and interactions among these factors.

#### Fatigue and Sleep Disorders

Cancer-related fatigue remains one of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms experienced by survivors. Fatigue and disturbed sleep were the most common symptoms reported out of 13 possible symptoms in one survey of more than 2,800 patients with breast, colorectal, prostate, or lung cancer, with approximately 33 percent of patients who had completed primary cancer therapy reporting three or more moderate to severe symptoms.

The underlying mechanisms of persistent fatigue are complex and multifactorial. One of the best studied biological explanations for persistent fatigue is inappropriate activation of the cytokine network, either because of the disease or the treatment. Risk factors for posttreatment fatigue include the presence of pretreatment fatigue, greater body mass index, and the type of cancer treatment.

#### Cancer-Related Cognitive Impairment

Cognitive dysfunction, often referred to as "chemobrain" or "cancer-related cognitive impairment" (CRCI), affects a significant proportion of cancer survivors. Cognitive rehabilitation appear beneficial for cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). Differential effects on specific cognitive domains (eg, processing speed) and subjective cognition may exist between intervention types.

CRCI is multifactorial and affected individuals frequently experience high levels of fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression and are most likely to benefit from holistic approaches that include cognition, physical activity, relaxation, psychoeducation, group support and/or psychological counselling.

### Special Considerations for Pediatric Survivors

Childhood cancer survivors face unique challenges due to their young age at treatment and the potential for treatment to interfere with normal development. Most survivors will experience at least one and often multiple cancer- and treatment-related late effects throughout their lives, including endocrine complications. The European survivor population of 300,000-500,000 continues to expand, highlighting the growing need for specialized long-term follow-up care.

More than 40 percent of pediatric cancer survivors develop a severe or life-threatening chronic health condition within 30 years of diagnosis. Overall, childhood cancer survivors have about a five- to six-fold increased risk of developing a secondary cancer.

## Psychosocial Challenges for Survivors

The psychological and social impact of cancer extends well beyond the completion of treatment, creating complex challenges that can persist for years or even decades. People with cancer face the risk of substantial and permanent physical impairment, disability, and inability to perform routine activities of daily living, as well as the psychological and social problems that can result from the diagnosis and its sequelae.

### Mental Health Complications

Cancer survivors experience significantly higher rates of mental health issues compared to the general population. The prevalence of depression and anxiety among cancer patients is significantly greater than that seen in the general population. Research demonstrates that cancer patients who are most at risk of psychological and/or behavioral difficulties include those with a prior history of anxiety or mood disorders; men; the aged (risk rises at age 55 and older); those who are alone, either actually or functionally; individuals who are unemployed or are of low socioeconomic status; patients receiving the most toxic therapies; and individuals with progressive disease or recurrence.

The impact of untreated mental health issues extends beyond psychological well-being. A meta-analysis of 50 studies showed a significantly heightened risk (hazard ratio of 1.34) for premature mortality among patients with breast, lung, stomach, or colorectal cancer who were also diagnosed with depression.

### Psychosocial Effects in Childhood Cancer Survivors

Adult survivors of childhood cancer face particularly complex psychosocial challenges. Adult survivors are twice as likely as sibling controls to report significant psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety and depression. They are almost twice as likely to report suicide ideation and impaired mental health, and they are nearly four times more likely to be diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms compared with their siblings.

The social and functional impacts are equally significant. Compared with siblings, adult survivors of childhood cancers are approximately five times more likely to report functional impairment in health-related quality of life; about three times more likely to report using special education services; less likely to attend college; six times more likely to report unemployment related to health; and more likely to be unmarried.

### Long-term Appraisal and Coping

The way cancer survivors perceive their experience evolves over time. Cancer survivorship is best viewed as a process that continues across the life span. Appraisals of cancer change over time and may not be explicit until long after treatment completion. Understanding these changing perceptions is crucial for providing appropriate support throughout the survivorship journey.

### Evidence-Based Psychosocial Interventions

Research has identified several effective interventions for addressing psychosocial challenges in cancer survivors. Effective psychosocial interventions that reduce emotional distress and improve quality of life in high-risk patients typically include some sort of stress reduction strategy (e.g., relaxation training), information, behavioral and cognitive coping strategies (e.g., dealing with fatigue), social support, and focused interventions.

Meta-analyses have demonstrated positive outcomes with various approaches. Positive outcomes were found with psycho-education, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation, and mindfulness-based stress reduction. Six meta-analyses found moderate to very large effect sizes, particularly for depression.

## Rehabilitation and Reintegration

Rehabilitation plays a crucial role in optimizing functional outcomes and quality of life for cancer survivors. Cancer rehabilitation can be broadly defined as the maximum restoration of physical, psychologic, social, vocational, recreational, and economic functions within the limits imposed by the malignancy and its treatment.

### Physical Rehabilitation

The need for rehabilitation services among cancer survivors is substantial yet often unmet. In one study, 163 women with metastatic breast cancer reported a total of 530 physical impairments that were not detected during hospitalization, but which required physical therapy and/or occupational therapy. In another study of 529 older adults with cancer, 341 (approximately 64 percent) had potentially modifiable functional deficits and needed physical or occupational therapy, but only 9 percent of the patients with these impairments received such therapy.

#### Systematic Evidence for Rehabilitation

A systematic review of prospective, controlled trials investigating rehabilitative interventions for cancer survivors found evidence supporting the efficacy of rehabilitative interventions for individuals with a cancer history across a range of functional domains. These findings provide strong evidence for integrating rehabilitation services into standard survivorship care.

Studies published so far report statistically significant benefits for multidimensional interventions over usual care, most notably for the outcomes fatigue, quality of life, and physical functioning. However, multidimensional rehabilitation programs were found to be effective, but not more effective than monodimensional interventions, and not on all outcome measures.

#### Exercise and Physical Activity

Exercise interventions have demonstrated particular promise in cancer rehabilitation. Existing interventions are effective in achieving modest increases in physical activity at least 3 months post-intervention completion. Small improvements were also evident in control groups suggesting low-intensity interventions may be sufficient in promoting small changes in behaviour that last beyond intervention completion.

Initial evidence indicates that exercise is feasible and may provide physiological and psychological benefits for cancer survivors during the rehabilitation period. The evidence strongly supports the integration of exercise programs into comprehensive survivorship care.

#### Cognitive Rehabilitation

For survivors experiencing cognitive difficulties, specialized rehabilitation approaches have shown promise. The available evidence supports clinical implementation of cognitive rehabilitation to improve CRCD (cancer-related cognitive dysfunction), with further work in program development, dissemination, and feasibility recommended.

All studies found improvements on at least one cognitive measure (performance-based or self-reported). By cognitive domain, objective improvements in memory were most commonly reported, followed by executive functions and processing speed.

### Prehabilitation

An emerging concept in cancer care is prehabilitation, designed to optimize patient function before treatment begins. Prehabilitation is defined as a process on the cancer continuum of care that occurs between the time of diagnosis and the beginning of acute treatment and includes physical and psychological assessments that establish a baseline functional level, identify impairments, and provide targeted interventions that promote physical and psychological health to reduce the incidence and/or severity of future impairments.

### Return to Work and Employment

Employment represents a critical aspect of rehabilitation for working-age cancer survivors. Research shows that among the approximately 15.5 million survivors in the United States, about 7 million are of working age. Employment represents a key element of quality of life, and survivors are very motivated to keep working to retain their health insurance and to combat financial toxicity, as well as to maintain a sense of normalcy, self-worth, and accomplishment.

About half of women with breast cancer reported that cancer treatment interfered with their physical efforts at work. These women also reported difficulty with concentration (31 percent), the ability to do analysis (28 percent), keeping the pace set by others (39 percent), and learning new things (20 percent).

### Guidelines and Standards

Guidelines promote high quality cancer care. Rehabilitation recommendations in oncology guidelines have not been characterized and may provide insight to improve integration of rehabilitation into oncology care. Findings identify guidelines that recommend rehabilitation services across many cancer types and for various consequences of cancer treatment signifying that rehabilitation is a recognized component of oncology care.

Despite these recommendations, these findings are at odds with clinical reports of low rehabilitation utilization rates suggesting that guideline recommendations may be overlooked. Considering that functional morbidity negatively affects a majority of cancer survivors, improving guideline concordant rehabilitative care could have substantial impact on function and quality of life among cancer survivors.

## Quality of Life after Cancer

Quality of life encompasses multiple dimensions of well-being, including physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects. For cancer survivors, quality of life is influenced by treatment-related effects, psychosocial adjustment, social support, and economic factors.

### Comprehensive Quality of Life Assessment

There is increasing awareness of the importance of using patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to accurately assess these effects in cancer survivors. Multiple studies have demonstrated that PROs more accurately capture patient symptoms than physician assessment.

### Long-term Symptom Burden

Symptom burden associated with cancer survivorship was consistent among the four most common types of cancer (breast, gynecological, prostate, and rectal/colon), despite various types of treatment exposure. The symptoms include physical limitations, cognitive limitations, depression/anxiety, sleep problems, fatigue, pain, and sexual dysfunctions.

### Family and Caregiver Impact

Cancer's impact extends beyond the patient to family members and caregivers, affecting their quality of life and well-being. There were approximately 43.5 million adults in the United States providing care to an adult or child in the preceding 12 months, and cancer was identified as the fourth main reason for which people needed a family caregiver. The vast majority (88 percent) of cancer caregivers provide care to a relative.

The emotional toll on caregivers is significant. Emotional distress such as anxiety and depression are high (approximately 38 percent) among caregivers at 2 years postdiagnosis and persist at 5 years (approximately 21 percent). The rates of anxiety and depression were higher among caregivers of cancer patients than they were for caregivers of other types of patients.

### Financial Toxicity and Quality of Life

Financial concerns represent a significant factor affecting quality of life for many cancer survivors, with the emergence of "financial toxicity" as a recognized clinical syndrome.

#### Prevalence and Impact

A substantial proportion of cancer survivors experience financial hardship irrespective of how it is measured. The most commonly reported factors associated with FT were: being female, younger age, low income at baseline, adjuvant therapies and more recent diagnosis. A total of 28-48% of patients reported FT using monetary measures and 16-73% using subjective measures.

Cancer survivors often face income loss and additional expenses, leading to ongoing financial difficulties that affect their psychological well-being. Despite this significant impact, there is a lack of guidance and support to help them manage these financial challenges.

#### Understanding Financial Toxicity

Financial toxicity is more than costs of care: it includes the topics "Coping with cancer and employment," "Coping with limited economic resources," and "Maintaining care resources while facing economic pressure." The results highlight the importance of screening for the risk of financial toxicity in the clinical context and individual risk and resource assessment.

Cancer survivors incur FT; however, their awareness of FT is limited. Cancer-related FT has multiple impacts on survivors' lives. Although cancer survivors try to cope with FT through adjustments, they still have unmet needs for the management of FT.

#### Interventions for Financial Toxicity

Research has begun to identify effective interventions to address financial toxicity. The primary strategy to intervene on FT at the patient level is financial navigation. Financial navigation uses comprehensive assessment of patients' risk factors for FT, guidance toward support resources, and referrals to assist patient financial needs during cancer care.

A variety of interventions have been tested to mitigate financial hardship. Financial navigation can mitigate financial worry among high-risk patients. However, more research is needed to identify the most effective approaches for different populations and care settings.

### Survivorship Care Plans

Survivorship care plans have emerged as an important tool for addressing quality of life concerns, though their effectiveness remains under investigation. Several organizations recommend that cancer survivors receive a survivorship care plan (SCP) comprising a treatment summary and follow-up care plans. However, the impact of SCPs on cancer survivors and health care professionals is unclear.

Meta-analysis results showed no significant differences between SCP recipients and controls at 6 months postintervention on self-reported cancer and survivorship knowledge, physical functioning, satisfaction with information provision, or self-efficacy or at 12 months on anxiety, cancer-specific distress, depression, or satisfaction with follow-up care. SCPs appear to be acceptable and potentially improve survivors' adherence to medical recommendations and health care professionals' knowledge of survivorship care and late effects.

### Models of Survivorship Care

Various models of care have been developed to optimize quality of life outcomes for cancer survivors. Cancer survivor risk stratification will affect timing of support needs, and survivorship care programs need to provide repeated assessments over time of their key outcomes to explore how (or whether) outcomes change with additional followup interactions or increased duration of followup.

The development of risk-stratified approaches represents a promising direction for improving care efficiency and effectiveness while optimizing resource utilization.

## Conclusion

Cancer survivorship represents a complex and evolving field that addresses the multifaceted needs of the growing population of individuals living with and beyond cancer. The evidence clearly demonstrates that cancer survivors experience significant long-term and late effects from their treatment, including physical complications, psychological distress, social challenges, and financial hardship. However, research also shows that many of these effects can be effectively managed through appropriate screening, early intervention, evidence-based rehabilitation services, and comprehensive supportive care.

As the number of individuals living years beyond a cancer diagnosis can be expected to continue to increase, both length and quality of survival are important end points. Many cancer survivors are at risk for and develop physiologic and psychosocial late and long-term effects of cancer treatment that may lead to premature mortality and morbidity.

The field has made significant progress since the 2006 Institute of Medicine report, with increased awareness, improved models of care, and growing evidence base for effective interventions. However, substantial challenges remain in translating research findings into clinical practice, ensuring equitable access to survivorship services, and addressing the financial toxicity associated with cancer care.

Moving forward, the field of cancer survivorship will benefit from:

1. **Enhanced Integration**: Better integration of survivorship care into the broader cancer care continuum, with improved coordination between oncology and primary care providers.

2. **Evidence-Based Practice**: Continued development and implementation of evidence-based interventions for managing late effects, with particular attention to multidisciplinary approaches that address the whole person.

3. **Risk Stratification**: Implementation of risk-stratified models of care that match the intensity of follow-up to individual survivor needs and risk factors.

4. **Technology Integration**: Utilization of technology, including patient-reported outcome measures, telehealth, and electronic health records, to improve care coordination and patient engagement.

5. **Addressing Disparities**: Focused efforts to address disparities in survivorship care access and outcomes, particularly for underserved populations.

6. **Financial Advocacy**: Development and implementation of comprehensive financial navigation programs to address the growing burden of financial toxicity.

The ultimate goal remains ensuring that all cancer survivors receive high-quality, patient-centered care that enables them to achieve optimal health, function, and quality of life after cancer treatment. As the evidence base continues to evolve, healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers must work collaboratively to translate these findings into improved outcomes for the growing population of cancer survivors worldwide.
