# Chapter 4: Genetics and Genomic Instability in Cancer

## 4.1 DNA Structure and Replication

The relationship between DNA and cancer is fundamental, as cancer is ultimately a disease of altered genetic information. Understanding DNA structure and the replication process provides critical insights into how genetic alterations arise and contribute to carcinogenesis.

### 4.1.1 DNA Structure and Organization

DNA serves as the repository of genetic information in all living organisms. The structure consists of two polynucleotide strands coiled around each other in a double helix, where each strand acts as a template for synthesis of a new complementary daughter strand.

**Nucleotides and Base Pairing**

The building blocks of DNA are nucleotides, each composed of a deoxyribose sugar, phosphate group, and nitrogenous base. The four nitrogenous bases in DNA are adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs: adenine pairs with thymine through two hydrogen bonds, and guanine pairs with cytosine through three hydrogen bonds.

**DNA Packaging in Chromosomes**

The entire DNA strand must fit within the nucleus of a cell, so it must be very tightly packaged. This is accomplished by wrapping the DNA around structural histone proteins, which act as scaffolding for the DNA to be coiled around. The entire structure is called a nucleosome, each of which includes an octamer of histone proteins and 146 to 147 base pairs of DNA. The millions of nucleosomes tightly coil the continuous DNA strand into chromatin which is further condensed into the chromosome classically visualized during cell division.

**Chromatin Organization**

In addition to the need for systematic compaction of DNA for replication and cell division, it is important for the interphase cell to have its DNA organized within the nucleus. This organization helps to section the DNA into different areas of cell expression, among other functions. Eukaryotic DNA is organized into loops, which can vary from 25 to 200 base pairs long.

### 4.1.2 DNA Replication Process

DNA replication is a semiconservative process in which each parental strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary daughter strand. The central enzyme involved is DNA polymerase, which catalyzes the joining of deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphates (dNTPs) to form the growing DNA chain.

**Replication Initiation**

The replication of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNAs starts at a unique sequence called the origin of replication, which serves as a specific binding site for proteins that initiate the replication process. Eukaryotes have multiple origins of replication whereas prokaryotes have one. Replication begins when origin-binding proteins bind to the origin of replication on the DNA.

**The Replication Fork**

An active zone of DNA replication moves progressively along a replicating DNA molecule, creating a Y-shaped DNA structure known as a replication fork. Then the unwinding of the double helix proceeds by way of the enzyme, helicase, creating a replication fork. Single-stranded binding proteins (SSBs) stabilize the unwound DNA, preventing it from forming into secondary structures.

**Leading and Lagging Strands**

The DNA daughter strand that is synthesized continuously is known as the leading strand. Its synthesis slightly precedes the synthesis of the daughter strand that is synthesized discontinuously, known as the lagging strand. For the lagging strand, the direction of nucleotide polymerization is opposite to the overall direction of DNA chain growth. The synthesis of the lagging strand by a discontinuous "backstitching" mechanism means that only the 5′-to-3′ type of DNA polymerase is needed for DNA replication.

**Okazaki Fragments**

Researchers added highly radioactive ³H-thymidine to dividing bacteria for a few seconds, revealing the transient existence of pieces of DNA that were 1000–2000 nucleotides long, now commonly known as Okazaki fragments, at the growing replication fork. (Similar replication intermediates were later found in eucaryotes, where they are only 100–200 nucleotides long.) The Okazaki fragments were shown to be polymerized only in the 5′-to-3′chain direction and to be joined together after their synthesis to create long DNA chains.

### 4.1.3 Accuracy of DNA Replication

The accuracy of DNA replication is critical to cell reproduction, and estimates of mutation rates for a variety of genes indicate that the frequency of errors during replication corresponds to only one incorrect base per 10⁹ to 10¹⁰ nucleotides incorporated. This error frequency is much lower than would be predicted simply on the basis of complementary base pairing.

**Proofreading Mechanisms**

Most of these errors are corrected by DNA polymerase during replication with its inherent proofreading mechanism via its 3′-exonuclease activity. This mechanism allows for the polymerase to read the most recently placed base before adding the next one. If the base does not pair correctly with the base on the template strand, then the exonuclease mechanism cuts the phosphodiester bond and releases the nucleotide.

Combined with the ability to discriminate against the insertion of mismatched bases, the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases is sufficient to reduce the error frequency of replication to about one mismatched base per 10⁹. Additional mechanisms act to remove mismatched bases that have been incorporated into newly synthesized DNA, further ensuring correct replication of the genetic information.

### 4.1.4 DNA Replication and Cancer

Cancers can arise from errors or mutations in DNA replication. The function of DNA replication is multifold and essential to life as we know it. This biological process allows for the genetic blueprints of a cell to be passed on to daughter cells in cell division without loss of genetic information.

Most cells in the body go through a cycle of life in which their genetic information is retained, fixed, and passed down to daughter cells through a highly coordinated and regulated process. However, during this cell cycle, there are many situations where mistakes are made by the cycle or by a regulating system that causes the cell to proliferate uncontrollably, leading to cancer.

## 4.2 Mutations: Types and Consequences

A mutation is a change in the nucleotide sequence of a short region of a genome. Many mutations are point mutations that replace one nucleotide with another; others involve insertion or deletion of one or a few nucleotides. Mutations result either from errors in DNA replication or from the damaging effects of mutagens, such as chemicals and radiation, which react with DNA and change the structures of individual nucleotides.

### 4.2.1 Types of Mutations

**Point Mutations**

One must first make the distinction between large-scale mutations, where a whole chunk of a chromosome is lost, relocated, or rearranged, vs. point mutation. A point mutation is typically a change in just one base pair in a DNA molecule, and a difference of even only one nucleotide can be enough to cause significant problems in the body.

For example, sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that results because of a difference in a single nucleotide in the DNA of a carrier when compared to the DNA of a non-carrier. This difference occurs in the gene that codes for one of the subunits of hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen through the bloodstream.

**Spontaneous Mutations**

Some mutations are spontaneous errors in replication that evade the proofreading function of the DNA polymerases that synthesize new polynucleotides at the replication fork. These mutations are called mismatches because they are positions where the nucleotide that is inserted into the daughter polynucleotide does not match, by base-pairing, the nucleotide at the corresponding position in the template DNA.

**Induced Mutations**

One such mutagen is radiation. Photons of light from the ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum are high-energy particles, and if they collide with DNA in specific locations, they can cause pyrimidine dimers, which is when two adjacent thymine or cytosine bases become covalently linked, which distorts DNA, making normal genetic activity impossible.

### 4.2.2 Functional Consequences of Mutations

**Gain-of-Function vs Loss-of-Function**

Gain-of-function mutations are much less common. The mutation must be one that confers an abnormal activity on a protein. Many gain-of-function mutations are in regulatory sequences rather than in coding regions. For example, a mutation might lead to one or more genes being expressed in the wrong tissues, or could lead to overexpression of one or more genes involved in control of the cell cycle, thus leading to uncontrolled cell division and hence to cancer. Because of their nature, gain-of-function mutations are usually dominant. A loss-of-function mutation is usually recessive because a functional version of the gene is present on the second chromosome copy.

### 4.2.3 Somatic Mutations in Cancer

A somatic mutation describes any alteration at the cellular level in somatic tissues occurring after fertilization. These mutations do not involve the germline and consequently do not pass on to offspring. Somatic mutations are a normal part of aging and occur throughout an organism's life cycle either spontaneously as a result of errors in DNA repair mechanisms or a direct response to stress.

**Accumulation of Somatic Mutations**

As a result of defects in tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, and genes required for genome stability, the individual inherits an increased risk for cancer in corresponding genes as somatic mutations continue to accumulate within already unstable genes. The mutations can build up faster than repair mechanisms can repair, rendering DNA repair ineffective, resulting in loss of function in the respective gene.

**Cancer Development Through Mutations**

The somatic mutation theory became widely accepted as the primary cause of cancer. The carcinogenesis process involves multiple events of genetic DNA damage (mutations) and epigenetic modifications in gene expression that accumulate sequentially. These changes contribute to the gradual acquisition of the hallmarks of cancer, ultimately resulting in fully developed, metastatic cancer.

### 4.2.4 Mutation Rates and Cancer Risk

Recent studies estimate the rate of mutation accumulation to range from 13 to 44 mutations per genome per year. This rate increases with exposure to environmental factors that induce DNA abnormalities, such as radiation, smoking, pollutants, and alcohol.

The density of single-nucleotide mutations across a genome differs by nearly 4 orders of magnitude (> 10 000-fold) between cancer types with strong environmental factors and tumours with little such evidence, such as paediatric cancers.

## 4.3 Chromosomal Abnormalities

Chromosomal abnormalities are hallmarks of cancer cells and play crucial roles in cancer initiation, progression, and evolution. These abnormalities range from numerical changes affecting entire chromosomes to structural rearrangements.

### 4.3.1 Types of Chromosomal Abnormalities

**Numerical Abnormalities**

Many cancer cells contain large quantities of mutant p53 protein, suggesting that the genetic accidents they undergo have created signals that normally call p53 into play. The loss of p53 activity leads to the genetic instability characteristic of cancer cells, allowing further cancer-promoting mutations to accumulate as they divide. A common consequence is that chromosomes become fragmented and incorrectly rejoined, creating, through further rounds of cell division, an increasingly disrupted genome.

**Structural Abnormalities**

Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), named after the city where it was first described, was described for the first time by Nowell and Hungerford in 1960, in two patients who had lost the long arm of chromosome 22. As the Giemsa staining improved over the decade, Rowley showed that this truncated chromosome was generated as a result of the translocation of the long arm of chromosomes 9 and 22.

Philadelphia chromosome is the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) along with some other leukemias including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL), and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL).

### 4.3.2 Chromosomal Instability Syndromes

Chromosomal instability syndromes are a group of inherited disorders associated with chromosomal instability and breakage spontaneously or in response to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging agents. Most of these syndromes are significant because they are associated with variable degrees of immunodeficiency, infectious disease, and the risk of developing certain malignancies.

**Specific Syndromes**

Bloom syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a lack of BLM helicase enzyme, resulting from a mutation in the BLM gene. Fanconi anemia is a DNA repair disorder where cells cannot repair DNA damage caused by interstrand cross-links. This defect eventually leads to chromosomal instability, particularly upon exposure to cytotoxic therapies, and a general predisposition to certain cancers.

### 4.3.3 Detection Methods

Chromosomes from a breast tumor displaying abnormalities in structure and number. Chromosomes were prepared from a breast tumor cell in metaphase, spread on a glass slide, and stained with a general DNA stain or a combination of fluorescent stains. Different tumors—even from the same tissues—can show different kinds of genetic instability, caused by mutations in one or another of a very specific set of genes whose products are needed to protect the genome from alteration.

### 4.3.4 Clinical Significance

In some cases, a specific gross chromosomal abnormality, visible under the microscope, is repeatedly associated with a particular type of cancer. This can give a clue to the location of either an oncogene that is activated as a result of the chromosomal rearrangement or a tumor suppressor gene that is deleted.

## 4.4 DNA Repair Mechanisms and Their Failure in Cancer

Most spontaneous changes in DNA are temporary because they are immediately corrected by a set of processes that are collectively called DNA repair. Of the thousands of random changes created every day in the DNA of a human cell by heat, metabolic accidents, radiation of various sorts, maintaining genetic stability requires not only an extremely accurate mechanism for replicating DNA, but also mechanisms for repairing the many accidental lesions that occur continually in DNA.

### 4.4.1 Overview of DNA Damage

DNA is the template from which everything inside the human body is built, so it is incredibly important that nothing happens to this code. Unfortunately, the DNA is at constant risk of mutation, which means a change to the genetic information in a cell, and this can happen due to a variety of factors.

### 4.4.2 Major DNA Repair Pathways

**Base Excision Repair**

Base excision repair works by excising a single damaged base or nucleotide; this is under the mediation of DNA glycosylases cutting the bond between the nitrogenous base and the deoxyribose sugars. When the glycosylases remove the base, it creates an apurinic site if the removed base was a purine (adenine, guanine), or an apyrimidinic site if the excised base was a pyrimidine (cytosine, thymine).

As an example of the general mechanism of base excision repair, the removal of a deaminated C by uracil DNA glycosylase is shown. A key step is an enzyme-mediated "flipping-out" of the altered nucleotide from the helix, which allows the enzyme to probe all faces of the base for damage. It is thought that DNA glycosylases travel along DNA using base-flipping to evaluate the status of each base pair.

**Nucleotide Excision Repair**

Nucleotide excision repair is most common when exposure to UV radiation has caused the formation of pyrimidine dimers. A nuclease enzyme can spot the problem and snip out a section of the DNA strand containing the lesion. Then polymerase puts new bases in the gap, and ligase seals it up, correcting the error.

The second major repair pathway is called nucleotide excision repair. This mechanism can repair the damage caused by almost any large change in the structure of the DNA double helix. Such "bulky lesions" include those created by the covalent reaction of DNA bases with large hydrocarbons, as well as the various pyrimidine dimers caused by sunlight.

**Mismatch Repair**

Mismatch repair is a type of correcting mechanism that fixes mistakes in DNA after replication or transcription that remain uncorrected by the exonuclease function of DNA polymerase, specifically bases that incorrectly match with the wrong base on the complementary strand. This strand-directed mismatch repair system detects the potential for distortion in the DNA helix that results from the misfit between noncomplementary base pairs.

The importance of this system is indicated by the fact that individuals who inherit one defective copy of a mismatch repair gene have a marked predisposition for certain types of cancers.

### 4.4.3 Double-Strand Break Repair

A chromosomal double-strand break (DSB) can arise from multiple sources including ionizing radiation and DNA replication itself. The ATM kinase plays an early, pivotal role in the signaling process by detecting DSBs and relaying this information to numerous downstream transducer and effector proteins.

A potentially dangerous type of DNA damage occurs when both strands of the double helix are broken, leaving no intact template strand for repair. Breaks of this type are caused by ionizing radiation, oxidizing agents, replication errors, and certain metabolic products in the cell. If these lesions were left unrepaired, they would quickly lead to the breakdown of chromosomes into smaller fragments.

### 4.4.4 DNA Repair Defects and Cancer

**Hereditary Cancer Syndromes**

Mutations in at least 30 DNA-repair-associated genes have been linked to increased cancer susceptibility or premature aging. This is the mutator phenotype.

Mutations in genes for proteins responsible for mismatch repairs such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 can result in certain cancers such as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (also known as Lynch Syndrome) and ovarian cancers.

**Xeroderma Pigmentosum**

One of the best characterized of these is xeroderma pigmentosum, which results from a mutation in any one of several genes for proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair. Nucleotide excision is the only way in which human cells can repair cyclobutyl dimers and other photoproducts, so it is no surprise that the symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum include hypersensitivity to UV radiation, patients suffering more mutations than normal on exposure to sunlight, which often leads to skin cancer.

**Clinical Significance**

The 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Tomas Lindahl and Aziz Sancar for their groundbreaking research on fundamental DNA repair mechanisms, including mismatch repair, base excision repair, and nucleotide excision repair. If DNA damage is irreparable, the affected cells undergo programmed cell death, also known as apoptosis.

### 4.4.5 DNA Repair Surveillance

There are over 100 different types of DNA repair enzymes in every cell in our body, keeping constant vigil over the sacred genetic code.

All cells possess DNA-repair enzymes that attempt to minimize the number of mutations that occur. These enzymes work in two ways. Some are pre-replicative and search the DNA for nucleotides with unusual structures, these being replaced before replication occurs; others are post-replicative and check newly synthesized DNA for errors, correcting any errors that they find.

## 4.5 Genomic Instability

From an evolutionary perspective this is not a surprise: one might expect that genetic instability would promote the formation of cancer, as it increases the probability that cells will experience a mutation that will lead toward malignancy. In fact, it seems that some degree of genetic instability may be essential for the development of cancer; at the very least it appears to make a powerful contribution to cancer progression.

### 4.5.1 Cancer as an Evolutionary Process

The body of an animal operates as a society or ecosystem whose individual members are cells, reproducing by cell division and organized into collaborative assemblies or tissues. The one ecological topic conspicuously absent was that of natural selection: we said nothing of competition or mutation among somatic cells. The reason is that a healthy body is in this respect a very peculiar society, where self-sacrifice—as opposed to survival of the fittest—is the rule.

**Evidence for Somatic Evolution**

First, cells of a variety of cancers can be shown to have a shared abnormality in their DNA sequence that distinguishes them from the normal cells surrounding the tumor. Second, many of the agents known to give rise to cancer also cause genetic changes. Thus carcinogenesis (the generation of cancer) appears to be linked with mutagenesis (the production of a change in the DNA sequence).

### 4.5.2 Types of Genomic Instability

**Chromosomal Instability**

Some have argued that mutations causing chromosomal instability likely arise early in progression in many tumors. Such chromosomal instability could explain the accumulation of numerous genetic changes in a cell lineage, ultimately leading to malignant disease.

**Microsatellite Instability**

In patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, or HNPCC, the cancer cells in the tumors that develop are unusual, examination of their chromosomes reveals a normal (or almost normal) karyotype. In contrast, the vast majority of colorectal tumors in non-HNPCC patients have gross chromosomal abnormalities, with multiple translocations, deletions, and other aberrations, and a total of 55 to 70 or more chromosomes instead of the normal 46.

### 4.5.3 Mechanisms Driving Genomic Instability

**p53 Loss and Chromosomal Instability**

The loss of p53 activity can be trebly dangerous in relation to cancer. First, it allows faulty mutant cells to continue through the cell cycle. Second, it allows them to escape apoptosis. Third, it leads to the genetic instability characteristic of cancer cells, allowing further cancer-promoting mutations to accumulate as they divide.

**Telomere Dysfunction**

An important part of the answer may lie in the behavior of telomeres and the relationship between telomere shortening, replicative cell senescence, and genetic instability. Most human cells seem to have a built-in limit to their proliferation: they show replicative senescence. Replicative cell senescence in humans is thought to be caused by changes in the structure of telomeres—the repetitive DNA sequences and associated proteins that cap the ends of each chromosome.

### 4.5.4 Genomic Landscape of Cancer

The development of a cancer represents a new, distinct cell population characterized by a range of genetic events, some of which drive the cancer. Landscape analyses of events across entire cancer genomes have revealed a wide range of types of somatic genetic events (from single base mutations to the shattering of entire chromosomes), many involving driver genes, and even more mutations that appear to be passengers.

**Driver vs Passenger Mutations**

Some mutations inactivate genes that protect the cell from abnormal growth, known as tumour suppressor genes, whereas other mutations activate genes that accelerate abnormal growth, known as oncogenes. Characterization of cancer genomes has revealed that the origins of cancer are complex. The list of recurrently mutated cancer genes is relatively short, but there are many rarely mutated genes.

### 4.5.5 Clinical Implications of Genomic Instability

**Cancer Progression**

Two process may accelerate the accumulation of genomic change. First, changes early in progression may accelerate the production of subsequent changes. Second, competition and selection between cell lineages that harbor various genomic changes would favor clonal expansion of more aggressive lines.

**Therapeutic Considerations**

In addition to the leukemogenic effect, evidence suggests that BCR/ABL1 oncogene independently leads to genomic instability. Studies have shown that primary or acquired resistance to treatment as well as relapse, can be attributed to different mutations. Rearrangements in the BCR gene can help in the prediction of response to therapy.

## Conclusion

The genetics and genomic instability underlying cancer represent a complex interplay of normal cellular processes gone awry. The ability of cells to maintain a high degree of order in a chaotic universe depends upon the accurate duplication of vast quantities of genetic information carried in chemical form as DNA. Maintaining order also requires the continued surveillance and repair of this genetic information because DNA inside cells is repeatedly damaged by chemicals and radiation from the environment, as well as by thermal accidents and reactive molecules.

Understanding these fundamental processes—DNA replication, mutation, chromosomal aberrations, DNA repair, and genomic instability—provides the foundation for comprehending cancer biology and developing targeted therapeutic approaches. While the short-term survival of a cell can depend on preventing changes in its DNA, the long-term survival of a species requires that DNA sequences be changeable. In cancer, this balance is disrupted, leading to the progressive accumulation of genetic alterations that drive malignant transformation and tumor progression.

The evidence from authoritative medical literature demonstrates that cancer fundamentally represents a genetic disease, where the normal fidelity of DNA replication and repair systems becomes compromised, allowing the accumulation of mutations that ultimately transform normal cells into malignant ones. This understanding continues to inform the development of precision medicine approaches that target the specific genetic alterations driving each patient's cancer.
