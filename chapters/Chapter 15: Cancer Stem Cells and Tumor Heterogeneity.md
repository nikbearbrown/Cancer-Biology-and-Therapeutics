# Chapter 15: Cancer Stem Cells and Tumor Heterogeneity

## 15.1 Concept and Characteristics of Cancer Stem Cells

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a revolutionary concept in cancer biology that has fundamentally changed our understanding of tumor initiation, progression, and treatment resistance. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are defined as cells with self-renewal ability, tumor-initiating capacity, and the ability to give rise to more differentiated progeny. Though the frequency of these cells may vary among various kinds of tumors, they often represent a minor subset of tumor cells endowed exclusively with tumor-initiating ability.

### 15.1.1 Historical Context and Conceptual Foundation

The concept of cancer stem cells emerged from observations that only a small fraction of cells within a tumor could initiate new tumors when transplanted. Recent research has uncovered that tissue patterning of normal organ development requires normal tissue stem cells to give rise to a wide variety of cells. These normal tissue stem cells are capable of self-renewal while providing progenitor cells for asymmetrical division.

The CSC concept was established as a counterpart to normal tissue stem cells. As shown in figure 1, normal tissue stem cells give rise to various types of cells. In contrast, CSC has self-renewal capacity and manifests several characteristics such as initiation of metastasis, chemoresistance, and hierarchical reconstitution of the entire tumor.

**Terminology and Definitions**

Critics argue that since the origin of CSCs is not clearly understood and CSCs do not always seem to be originating from normal stem cells, the usage of the term CSC leads to ambiguity and confusion. Instead, the term tumor-initiating cell (TIC) has been suggested since seeding the growth of a tumor is one of the defining properties of CSCs.

However, originally the term 'cancer stem cell' was not coined based on the cancerous cell-of-origin, but rather due to similarities between stem cells and CSCs in terms of their ability to self renew, regenerate organs/tumors and give rise to more differentiated progeny. Hence, here onwards, the terms cancer stem cell (CSC) and tumor-initiating cell (TIC) will be used interchangeably.

### 15.1.2 Defining Characteristics of Cancer Stem Cells

**Self-Renewal and Differentiation Capacity**

Cancer stem cells possess the fundamental stem cell properties of self-renewal and multipotent differentiation. Unlike normal stem cells that contribute to tissue homeostasis, CSCs drive tumor growth and progression through dysregulated self-renewal mechanisms that favor expansion over differentiation.

**Tumor-Initiating Capacity**

According to the original definition of CSC, a cell can be classified as a CSC only when it is prospectively isolated and implanted into an immunocompromised mouse to show that the cell can induce serially transplantable tumors. This functional definition emphasizes the unique ability of CSCs to initiate tumor formation with relatively few cells compared to the bulk tumor population.

**Hierarchical Organization**

Currently the CSC phenotype can be summarized by its tumorigenicity, chemoresistance, metastatic ability and reconstruction of hierarchy. These characteristics were based on the resultant cancer cell behavior after the isolation of specific population from entire cancer cells.

A small number of CSCs can reconstruct the entire cancer tissue, leading to the recurrence after surgery. The hierarchical model suggests that CSCs sit at the apex of a cellular hierarchy, giving rise to various differentiated cancer cell types that constitute the bulk of the tumor.

### 15.1.3 Molecular Markers for Cancer Stem Cell Identification

**Marker-Based Identification Strategies**

CSCs in various cancers are mainly identified using cell-surface markers expressed on corresponding normal stem cells. Several methods have been proposed to identify, isolate and characterize CSCs. The two main strategies that are employed for the detection and characterization of CSCs include marker-dependent (or marker-based) and marker-independent strategies.

**Specific Markers in Different Cancer Types**

**Hematopoietic Malignancies:**
In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the CD34+CD38− marker combination was used to identify AML CSC, and the same combination also identifies normal HSCs. Genetic studies performed over 20 years ago demonstrated that the malignant clone in CML is a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell, capable of differentiating into myeloid cells, monocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets.

**Breast Cancer:**
In solid tumors, CSCs were initially identified in breast cancer (BCa) using a CD44+CD24− marker combination; these CD44+CD24− cells were purified from BCa samples using FACS and shown to possess stem cell properties. Al-Hajj et al. reported that CD24−/low/CD44+ fractions from metastatic pleural effusions and a primary invasive breast tumor had higher tumorigenic potential when injected into the mammary fat pad of female NOD/SCID mice than CD24+/CD44+/− cell fractions.

**Pancreatic Cancer:**
In pancreatic cancer, several CSC markers such as CD24/CD44/ESA triple positive or CD133 are identified and these CSC fractions revealed higher tumorigenicity, metastatic capability. The CD24/CD44/ESA triple positive cell population isolated from the surgical specimen also depicted the increased tumorigenicity in another study. The CD133/Prominin positive cell population revealed the capability to reconstruct the hierarchical population of tumor cells in an orthotopic implantation model.

**Hepatocellular Carcinoma:**
CSC markers of HCC include epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), CD133, CD90, CD44, CD24, CD13, deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22), and oval cell marker OV6. Some of these markers have been reported to confer chemoresistance to HCC.

### 15.1.4 Marker-Independent Identification Methods

**Side Population Analysis**

Side population (SP), a marker-independent strategy, was originally used to enrich normal HSC and leukemia SC but was later used extensively to enrich CSCs in several solid tumors. SP technique is based on the ability of stem cells to exclude Hoechst dye 33342 and appear as a side population compared with the normal differentiated cells, which take up the dye and appear as the main population.

For example, side population cell is defined by the ability to excrete Hoechst dye from cell and identified as a hematopoietic stem cell marker. Side population cells from pancreatic cancer cell lines also contain CSC fraction evidenced by increased tumorigenicity and chemoresistance.

**ABC Transporter Expression**

The ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family proteins such as MDR1 and ABCG2 are responsible for dye exclusion and the side population phenotypic profile. These markers are highly expressed on normal as well as CSCs and usually SP population overlaps with CSCs in several cancers.

For example, LAPC9, a prostate cancer (PCa) xenograft tumor, was found to have 0.1% SP cells; when these cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice, they were found to be highly tumorigenic (100-1000 times higher) compared with non-SP cells.

## 15.2 Tumor Heterogeneity and Clonal Evolution

Tumor heterogeneity represents one of the most significant challenges in cancer treatment and represents a fundamental characteristic that distinguishes malignant from benign neoplasms. Simply put, what makes cancer one of the deadliest diseases is its ability to change and adapt. Cancer cells' rapid evolution, coupled with their irrepressible ability to divide, gives most of them the advantage over our immune systems.

### 15.2.1 Types of Tumor Heterogeneity

**Intertumoral Heterogeneity**

Intertumoral heterogeneity refers to the differences observed between tumors of the same histological type arising in different patients. This type of heterogeneity explains why patients with seemingly identical cancers can have dramatically different responses to the same treatment regimen.

Genomic profiling of clinical samples across cancers has detailed the genomic underpinnings, suggested new cancer subtypes, and identified therapeutic targets that can be treated with available therapies or used to develop new drugs and therapies. Additionally, it has revealed high levels of intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity.

**Intratumoral Heterogeneity**

Intratumoral heterogeneity, referring to the variations among different tumor lesions and/or tumor cells within a single patient, is largely driven by genomic instability. Unstable genome in tumor cells leads to the occurrence of a wide range of mutations and, as such, fosters genetic diversity and the generation of genetically different cancer cell clones.

A recent study noted the coexistence of various genetically different subclones in advanced tumors, challenging the previously held notion that a dominant subclone usually appears in a given tumor. Furthermore, based on the expression of 110 genes, another study showed that different subpopulations in one clear cell carcinoma could be classified as either clear cell A (associated with good prognosis) or B (associated with poor prognosis).

**Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneity**

Additionally, it is worthy of note that intratumoral heterogeneity is not only limited to the uneven distribution of tumor clones across various lesions but also includes the dynamic changes of a given lesion (also termed as temporal heterogeneity).

Using whole-genome sequencing to analyze 43 tumor lesions from 10 HCC patients, Xue et al. showed that all the patients in this cohort presented with evidence of intratumoral heterogeneity. Importantly, the extent of intratumoral heterogeneity varied among different patients.

### 15.2.2 Molecular Mechanisms of Tumor Heterogeneity

**Genomic Instability**

As a tumor expands or develops metastasis, these clones would compete for survival, leading to clonal evolution of a given lesion or host. Therefore, the architecture of tumor lesion is determined by a framework composed of clonal evolution, competition, and best-fit selection.

The trillions of cells in a human slowly but steadily accumulate heritable change. Those heritable changes evolve in a spatially mosaic way. A few tissue patches may be advanced, poised to pass the next step to disease. Other tissue patches may be in an early stage, apparently normal but silently one step closer to malfunction.

**Epigenetic Alterations**

Epigenetics alterations lead to intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity. The complexity of genotype and epigenetic states creates the intratumoral heterogeneity of metabolism. Recent work on epigenetic processes shows that heritable genomic changes often accumulate by DNA methylation and histone modification. Tumors frequently have elevated rates of epigenetic change, providing another pathway to increase the rate of progression.

**Mutational Processes**

Some authors emphasize hypermutation, in which an early step of carcinogenesis reduces DNA repair efficacy or promotes chromosomal aberrations during cell division. Once the caretakers of genomic integrity have been damaged, subsequent changes may accumulate relatively rapidly.

### 15.2.3 Theories of Tumor Heterogeneity

**Clonal Evolution Model**

Heterogeneity is a hallmark of cancer. Clonal evolution theory and cancer stem cell theory explain tumor subpopulation growth. The clonal evolution theory claims that genetically and metabolically distinct subpopulations arise from a previously larger population of cancer cells due to the expansion of the population, genetic diversification, and selection of certain subclones over others.

There are currently two proposed models that lead to tumor heterogeneity. The first model suggests that heterogeneity stems from clonal evolution, where there are changes in single cells that create survival advantages between clonal populations.

**Cancer Stem Cell Model**

On the other hand, the CSC theory states that a significant source of heterogeneity in cancer cells is due to CSCs, which are undifferentiated and have high rates of division. These cancer stem cells possess largely variable metabolic phenotypes through their differentiation into different types of cells.

The second model relies on cancer stem cells to produce phenotypically diverse differentiated cells. These models are not mutually exclusive as the cancer stem cells have the opportunity to undergo clonal evolution for them to evolve into more aggressive, self-renewing stem cells.

### 15.2.4 Clonal Evolution and Progression

**Multistage Progression**

Several checks prevent uncontrolled proliferation of cells. Normal cells commit suicide when they cannot pass various quality control tests; a built-in counting mechanism limits the number of times a cell can divide; structural rigidity and physical partitions in tissues prevent expansion of abnormal cellular clones.

**Field Cancerization**

Fields of p53 mutants have been observed in the bladder. The concept of field cancerization suggests that localized tumors may emerge from a broader precancerous field. Subsequent work on "field cancerization" almost always assumes that the field grows by clonal expansion of a mutated cell in the fully developed organism.

**Metastatic Evolution**

Alternatively, migrant cells may arise at different stages of tumor development or from different lineages in late-stage tumors. In this case, the time back to common ancestors for colonist cells and the cells in the primary tumor would be variable; metastases derived from colonists would be genetically heterogeneous.

## 15.3 Implications for Treatment Resistance

The recognition that tumors contain heterogeneous populations of cells with varying degrees of treatment sensitivity has profound implications for therapeutic strategies. Treatment resistance represents one of the most significant clinical challenges in oncology, often determining the difference between cure and treatment failure.

### 15.3.1 Mechanisms of Treatment Resistance in Cancer Stem Cells

**Intrinsic Resistance Properties**

CSCs are reported to be highly resistant to the current chemotherapeutic agents. Currently available chemotherapeutic agents mainly target proliferating cancer cells and are unable to eliminate CSCs. The entire mechanism of chemoresistance in CSC is cryptic but recent researches clarified part of this picture.

They are also capable of differentiating into metabolically and functionally diverse subclones within a single tumor. Moreover, they are usually resistant to many therapeutic methods due to their undifferentiated state. This fact is supported by findings suggesting that more differentiated cancer stem cells tend to lead to better prognoses due to their decreased tumorigenic potential.

**Enhanced DNA Repair Mechanisms**

CSCs often exhibit enhanced DNA repair capacity, allowing them to survive DNA-damaging treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This enhanced repair ability contributes to their resistance to conventional cytotoxic therapies.

**Metabolic Adaptations**

CSCs demonstrate metabolic plasticity that allows them to survive in harsh microenvironmental conditions, including hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and the presence of therapeutic agents. This metabolic flexibility contributes to their survival advantage during treatment.

### 15.3.2 Drug Efflux Mechanisms

**ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporters**

Side population cells are reported to express high level of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Expression levels of ABC transporters in cancer cells determine chemoresistant phenotype since chemotherapeutic agents such as etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine and paclitaxel are direct substrates of ABC transporters.

ATP binding cassette (ABC)-containing drug efflux transporters play important roles in regulating intracellular drug concentrations that determine cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Of particular relevance to cancer chemotherapy are the transporters P-glycoprotein (Pgp) encoded by multidrug resistance 1 gene, multidrug resistance protein (MRP), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).

**Multidrug Resistance Proteins**

More than 80% of currently used antitumor agents can be transported by these three transporters, and overexpression of these transporters renders multidrug resistance to a broad spectrum of antitumor agents. Side population cells in pancreatic cancer also express ABCB1 and ABCG2 which play important role in chemoresistance of tumors in other organs.

Limited or prevented access of targeted tumor cells to chemotherapeutics drugs often result in the development of drug resistance. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein family members are located at the plasma membrane and use ATP as an energy source to effectively pump drugs out of the cell.

### 15.3.3 Treatment-Induced Selection Pressure

**Chemotherapy-Induced CSC Enrichment**

Another report indicated that conventional chemotherapy itself could propagate the CSC population in pancreatic cancer. Long-term culture of pancreatic cancer cell line L3.6pl and AsPC-1 with increasing doses of gemcitabine enhances the CD24/CD44/ESA triple positive CSC fraction.

These observations indicate that conventional therapies could create selective pressure for more malignant phenotype of cancer cells. While certain subpopulations with defined metabolic phenotypes may be sensitive to a suitable metabolic inhibitor, other subclones with different metabolic phenotypes may well be resistant to that drug.

**Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)**

These cells also revealed spindle-shaped appearance and decreased expression of E-cadherin which are the specific features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) suggesting the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype.

### 15.3.4 Resistance Mechanisms in Different Cancer Types

**Hepatocellular Carcinoma**

Although there has been tremendous progress in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma over the past decades, multidrug resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy remains a major hindrance in its successful management. Multidrug resistance, whether intrinsic or extrinsic, is a multifactorial process that includes enhanced drug efflux, decreased drug uptake, intracellular sequestration, metabolic alterations, aberrant apoptotic and autophagic signaling, changes in tumor microenvironment, and acquisition of stem cell-like properties by the cancer cells.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of tumor cells with the capacity of self-renewal, differentiation, as well as drug resistance. CD133+ HCC cells isolated from human HCC cell lines and xenograft mouse models were resistant to chemotherapeutics, through the activation of Akt/PKB and Bcl-2 pathways.

**Breast Cancer**

Over the past several decades, breast cancer survival rates have significantly improved. However, the response rates remain suboptimal. Moreover, few effective therapeutic regimens are available to treat those had been exposed to anthracyclines or failed to anthracycline treatments. These observations underscore the importance of multidrug resistance in breast cancer chemotherapy.

**Pancreatic Cancer**

Pancreatic cancer is a characteristic cancer by its dismal prognosis and resistance against conventional therapies such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The reasons for resistance against conventional therapy and re-growth of untreatable tumor are now attributed to the existence of cancer stem cells (CSC), which occupy only a small part of the entire cancer tissue.

### 15.3.5 Overcoming Treatment Resistance

**Targeting CSC-Specific Pathways**

Multi-signal pathways and their cross-talk, including EpCAM, Wnt/β-catenin, Sonic Hedgehog, and Notch, are required to maintain the stemness phenotype of HCC CSCs. Targeting these pathways represents a promising approach to overcome CSC-mediated resistance.

**Combination Therapy Approaches**

The recognition of tumor heterogeneity has led to the development of combination therapy approaches that target multiple cellular populations simultaneously. Rather than relying on single-agent therapy, combination regimens aim to address both CSCs and differentiated cancer cells.

**Immunotherapy and CSCs**

Growing evidence has suggested that lack of eradication of the malignant stem cell forms the basis for cancer relapse and progression. These data set the stage for newer approaches that focus on immune targeting of antigens that are present on the cancer stem cell.

Rational immune targeting of the tumor-initiating population critically depends on (1) identifying the unique surface markers of these cells so that they may be isolated, and on (2) defining antigens that are uniquely or preferentially expressed within the malignant cells with stem-cell like functions compared to normal cells.

## Clinical Implications and Future Directions

Understanding cancer stem cells and tumor heterogeneity has revolutionized our approach to cancer treatment and has provided new insights into why cancers are so difficult to cure permanently. The clinical implications of this knowledge are profound and continue to shape the development of new therapeutic strategies.

**Biomarker Development**

The identification of CSC markers has important prognostic implications. Liu et al. identified a distinct gene signature associated with tumorigenic CD24−/low/CD44+ cell populations compared to normal breast epithelium and observed correlation between this "invasive" gene signature with shorter distant metastasis-free and overall survival. These studies suggest that presence and frequency of this cell population has prognostic relevance.

**Personalized Medicine Approaches**

The heterogeneity of cancer necessitates personalized treatment approaches that take into account the specific cellular composition and molecular characteristics of individual tumors. This explains why patients may become unresponsive to second-round treatment after an initial successful first round in which most of the tumor was targeted and eliminated by the treatment, but small subpopulations were not.

**Therapeutic Targeting Strategies**

Future therapeutic strategies must address the challenge of tumor heterogeneity by developing treatments that can effectively target both CSCs and differentiated cancer cells. This may require combination therapies that simultaneously target multiple pathways and cellular populations.

The complexity of tumor heterogeneity and the role of cancer stem cells in treatment resistance continue to be active areas of research, with the ultimate goal of developing more effective and durable treatments for cancer patients.
