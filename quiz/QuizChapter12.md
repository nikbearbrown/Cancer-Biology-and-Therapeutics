# Chapter 12 Quiz: Angiogenesis

## Instructions
Choose the best answer for each question. Each question tests understanding of key concepts from angiogenesis in cancer.

---

**Question 1:** The "angiogenic switch" refers to:

a) The moment when blood vessels start to bleed in tumors

b) A regulatory transition where the balance tips from anti-angiogenic to pro-angiogenic factors, allowing dormant tumors to become vascularized and grow

c) When tumors switch from using one growth factor to another

d) The replacement of old blood vessels with new ones

---

**Question 2:** Why do tumors remain dormant at approximately 1-2 mm in diameter without angiogenesis?

a) Cancer cells stop dividing at this size

b) The immune system can control tumors of this size

c) This represents the maximum diffusion distance for oxygen and nutrients from existing blood vessels

d) Genetic mutations prevent further growth

---

**Question 3:** What is the primary physiological stimulus that triggers angiogenesis in tumors?

a) Excess nutrients in the tumor microenvironment

b) Hypoxia (low oxygen), which activates HIF-1 and leads to VEGF production

c) High levels of carbon dioxide

d) Increased blood pressure in tumor vessels

---

**Question 4:** Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) functions as a master regulator of the hypoxic response by:

a) Directly repairing damaged blood vessels

b) Stabilizing under low oxygen conditions and activating transcription of genes including VEGF and glycolytic enzymes

c) Preventing cancer cell division

d) Blocking all angiogenic signals

---

**Question 5:** VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) promotes angiogenesis through multiple mechanisms. Which statement best describes its primary function?

a) It directly forms new blood vessels without requiring endothelial cells

b) It binds to VEGF receptors on endothelial cells, stimulating their proliferation, migration, and survival to form new vessels

c) It prevents existing blood vessels from collapsing

d) It only works in embryonic development, not in adults

---

**Question 6:** During sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial cells differentiate into two specialized types. What are their roles?

a) Tip cells lead the sprout and sense directional cues, while stalk cells proliferate and form the vessel lumen behind them

b) Both cell types do exactly the same thing

c) Tip cells form the lumen while stalk cells lead migration

d) Only tip cells are necessary for vessel formation

---

**Question 7:** What distinguishes normal physiological angiogenesis from pathological tumor angiogenesis?

a) Normal angiogenesis uses different growth factors than tumor angiogenesis

b) Normal angiogenesis occurs as brief, tightly regulated bursts lasting days to weeks, while tumor angiogenesis is persistent and sustained for months or years

c) Tumor angiogenesis only occurs in the brain

d) Normal angiogenesis produces larger blood vessels than tumor angiogenesis

---

**Question 8:** What is a major challenge limiting the long-term effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapies like bevacizumab?

a) They are too expensive to produce

b) Tumors develop resistance through alternative angiogenic pathways (FGF, PDGF, angiopoietins) and adaptive mechanisms

c) They cause immediate tumor regression in all cases

d) They only work for a few days after administration

---

**Question 9:** The angiopoietin-Tie2 system regulates vessel maturation and stability. How do Ang1 and Ang2 differ in their functions?

a) They have identical functions

b) Ang1 promotes vessel maturation and stability, while Ang2 destabilizes vessels; Ang2's effect depends on whether VEGF is present

c) Only Ang1 is important in cancer

d) Both only work to destroy blood vessels

---

**Question 10:** Why is understanding tumor angiogenesis important for cancer treatment beyond just anti-angiogenic drugs?

a) It's only important for developing anti-angiogenic drugs

b) Tumor vasculature affects drug delivery, hypoxia drives aggressive tumor behavior and resistance, and vessel normalization can improve therapy efficacy

c) Angiogenesis has no relationship to other cancer treatments

d) It only matters for metastasis, not primary tumor growth
