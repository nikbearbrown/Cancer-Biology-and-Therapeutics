# Chapter 10 Quiz: Apoptosis and Programmed Cell Death in Cancer

## Instructions
Choose the best answer for each question. Each question tests understanding of key concepts from apoptosis and programmed cell death.

---

**Question 1:** Apoptosis is mediated by which family of proteolytic enzymes?

a) Kinases

b) Phosphatases

c) Caspases

d) Proteases

---

**Question 2:** Apoptosis can be triggered by various stimuli. Which of the following represents intracellular stress signals that activate apoptosis?

a) Growth factor binding to receptors

b) DNA damage, oncogene activation, and hypoxia

c) Normal cell division signals

d) Nutrient abundance and oxygen supply

---

**Question 3:** The intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway involves the release of proteins from mitochondria. Which key event occurs that leads to caspase activation?

a) Direct activation of caspases by DNA damage

b) Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, leading to apoptosome formation

c) Activation of death receptors on the cell surface

d) Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 proteins

---

**Question 4:** The Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis and can be divided into pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members. How do pro-apoptotic members like Bax and Bak promote cell death?

a) They bind to and inactivate anti-apoptotic proteins, preventing cytochrome c release

b) They translocate to mitochondria and oligomerize to form pores, promoting cytochrome c release

c) They directly activate caspases in the cytoplasm

d) They block death receptor signaling

---

**Question 5:** The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by:

a) DNA damage within the nucleus

b) Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization

c) Binding of death ligands to cell surface death receptors

d) Loss of growth factor signals

---

**Question 6:** In follicular lymphoma, the BCL-2 gene is commonly affected by which genetic alteration?

a) Point mutation

b) Gene deletion

c) Chromosomal translocation from chromosome 18 to chromosome 14

d) Gene methylation

---

**Question 7:** The p53 tumor suppressor protein activates transcription of multiple target genes in response to cellular stress. How does p53 promote apoptosis?

a) By directly activating caspases

b) By activating transcription of pro-apoptotic genes like BAX, NOXA, and PUMA

c) By inhibiting mitochondrial function

d) By blocking death receptor signaling

---

**Question 8:** Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs) prevent apoptosis by:

a) Activating death receptors

b) Binding to and inhibiting procaspases and active caspases

c) Promoting cytochrome c release

d) Activating p53

---

**Question 9:** BH3 mimetics are a class of anti-cancer drugs that work by:

a) Activating caspases directly

b) Mimicking pro-apoptotic BH3 proteins to neutralize anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins

c) Inhibiting death receptors

d) Promoting p53 degradation

---

**Question 10:** TRAIL (TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand) is particularly promising as a cancer therapeutic because:

a) It only kills cancer cells through the intrinsic pathway

b) It selectively kills tumor cells while being harmless to normal cells

c) It works by inhibiting Bcl-2

d) It prevents all forms of cell death

---
