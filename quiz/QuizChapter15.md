# Chapter 15 Quiz: Cancer Stem Cells and Tumor Heterogeneity

## Instructions
Choose the best answer for each question. Each question tests understanding of key concepts from cancer stem cells and tumor heterogeneity.

---

**Question 1:** Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are defined by three key characteristics. Which of the following best describes these characteristics?

a) Large size, rapid division, and high metabolism

b) Self-renewal ability, tumor-initiating capacity, and ability to give rise to differentiated progeny

c) Resistance to all therapies, immortality, and metastatic ability only

d) High proliferation rate, large nuclei, and chromosomal instability

---

**Question 2:** Why do cancer stem cells often represent only a small fraction of tumor cells, yet are critical for tumor growth and treatment resistance?

a) They divide more slowly than other tumor cells

b) They only exist in certain types of cancers

c) They are larger than other cancer cells

d) They can self-renew and regenerate the entire tumor hierarchy, making them responsible for tumor maintenance and recurrence after treatment


---

**Question 3:** The "hierarchical model" of tumor organization suggests that:

a) All cancer cells have equal tumor-initiating potential

b) CSCs sit at the apex of a cellular hierarchy, giving rise to various differentiated cancer cell types that constitute the bulk of the tumor

c) Cancer cells are randomly organized with no hierarchy

d) Only differentiated cells can initiate tumors

---

**Question 4:** What is "intratumoral heterogeneity" and why is it clinically significant?

a) Differences between tumors in different patients

b) Variations among different tumor cells within a single patient's tumor, driven by genomic instability and clonal evolution, which contributes to treatment resistance

c) Differences in tumor size over time

d) Variations in tumor location within an organ

---

**Question 5:** How does chemotherapy paradoxically contribute to treatment resistance in many cancers?

a) It kills all cancer cells equally

b) It prevents cancer cells from dividing

c) It creates selective pressure that enriches cancer stem cell populations and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, leading to more aggressive phenotypes

d) It only targets normal cells

---

**Question 6:** ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters contribute to chemotherapy resistance in cancer stem cells by:

a) Repairing DNA damage caused by chemotherapy

b) Pumping chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cell, reducing intracellular drug concentrations

c) Activating drug-metabolizing enzymes

d) Preventing drugs from entering the bloodstream

---

**Question 7:** The "side population" technique identifies cancer stem cells based on their ability to:

a) Exclude Hoechst dye through ABC transporter expression, appearing as a distinct population in flow cytometry

b) Grow on only one side of a culture dish

c) Divide asymmetrically

d) Attach to the sides of blood vessels

---

**Question 8:** What are "drug tolerant persister" (DTP) cells and why are they clinically important?

a) Cells that help deliver drugs to tumors

b) Cancer cells that enter a dormant, stem-like state to survive chemotherapy and can revert to active cancer after treatment cessation, causing relapse

c) Normal cells that resist becoming cancerous

d) Cells that enhance drug effectiveness

---

**Question 9:** Why do conventional chemotherapies often fail to eliminate cancer stem cells?

a) CSCs divide too rapidly for drugs to work

b) CSCs are typically slow-cycling or quiescent, have enhanced DNA repair, express drug efflux pumps, and can adapt metabolically, making them resistant to therapies targeting rapidly dividing cells

c) CSCs are located outside the body

d) All chemotherapies specifically avoid CSCs

---

**Question 10:** What therapeutic strategy shows promise for overcoming CSC-mediated resistance by combining multiple approaches?

a) Using only one drug at the highest possible dose

b) Avoiding all treatments until the tumor grows larger

c) Combining CSC-targeted therapies (pathway inhibitors, immunotherapy, metabolic targeting) with conventional treatments to address both CSCs and bulk tumor cells simultaneously

d) Treating only with surgery and avoiding all drug therapies
