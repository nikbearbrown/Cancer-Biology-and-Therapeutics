# Chapter 13 Quiz: Invasion and Metastasis - The Spread of Cancer

## Instructions
Choose the best answer for each question. Each question tests understanding of key concepts from invasion and metastasis.

---

**Question 1:** The metastatic cascade can be broadly separated into three main processes. What are these processes?

a) Growth, division, and death

b) Invasion, intravasation, and extravasation

c) Mutation, selection, and adaptation

d) Angiogenesis, proliferation, and apoptosis

---

**Question 2:** According to Fidler's 1970 studies, what percentage of cancer cells released into circulation actually survive to produce metastases after 24 hours?

a) About 10%

b) About 1%

c) About 0.1%

d) About 0.01%

---

**Question 3:** Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process in cancer invasion. What happens during EMT?

a) Mesenchymal cells transform into epithelial cells

b) Epithelial cells lose polarity and cell-cell adhesion (like E-cadherin), gain mesenchymal features (like vimentin), and become more motile and invasive

c) Cells stop dividing completely

d) Cells become more differentiated and less mobile

---

**Question 4:** Which growth factor plays a dual role in cancer, acting both as a tumor suppressor early in cancer development and as a tumor promoter that enhances invasion and EMT?

a) VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)

b) EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor)

c) TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor-β)

d) FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor)

---

**Question 5:** Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) promote cancer invasion primarily by:

a) Directly killing normal cells to make space for tumor growth

b) Degrading extracellular matrix components, releasing growth factors, and facilitating cell migration

c) Preventing angiogenesis in normal tissues

d) Strengthening cell-cell adhesions

---

**Question 6:** At the time of cancer diagnosis, what proportion of patients already present with clinically detectable metastatic disease?

a) About 10%

b) About 25%

c) At least 50%

d) About 75%

---

**Question 7:** What are the four general routes of metastatic spread observed clinically?

a) Arterial, venous, capillary, and lymphatic

b) Hematogenous, lymphatic, transcoelomic, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)

c) Direct, indirect, primary, and secondary

d) Local, regional, distant, and systemic

---

**Question 8:** Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) face multiple survival challenges in the bloodstream. Which of the following is NOT one of these challenges?

a) Lack of adhesion sites (leading to anoikis)

b) Strong hemodynamic forces

c) Attack by the innate immune system

d) Excessive nutrient availability

---

**Question 9:** Why is angiogenesis essential for successful metastasis beyond just the primary tumor?

a) Angiogenesis only occurs in primary tumors, not metastases

b) Metastatic cells must induce angiogenesis at distant sites to grow beyond microscopic size, and tumor vessels provide routes for further dissemination

c) Angiogenesis prevents metastasis from occurring

d) Metastatic tumors don't require blood supply

---

**Question 10:** Why might some metastatic cells remain dormant as microscopic tumors (100-200 μm) for years or even decades after reaching a distant organ?

a) They are immediately destroyed by the immune system

b) They lack angiogenic activity and cannot recruit new blood vessels to grow beyond microscopic size

c) They always grow rapidly but are too small to detect

d) They revert back to normal cells
