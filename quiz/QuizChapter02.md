## Instructions
Choose the best answer for each question. Each question tests understanding of key concepts from cancer introduction and biology.

---

**Question 1:** The four conceptual steps of carcinogenesis are:

a) Mutation, selection, invasion, and metastasis

b) Tumor initiation, tumor promotion, malignant conversion, and tumor progression

c) DNA damage, cell growth, angiogenesis, and spread

d) Initiation, inflammation, proliferation, and dissemination

---

**Question 2:** Compared to normal cells, malignant cells take approximately how much more glucose from the blood?

a) 2-3 fold more glucose

b) 5-10 fold more glucose

c) 15-20 fold more glucose

d) 50-100 fold more glucose

---

**Question 3:** Who is credited with originating the word "cancer" and why was this term chosen?

a) Galen, because tumors feel hard like a crab's shell

b) Hippocrates, because the finger-like spreading projections from a cancer resembled a crab

c) Virchow, because cancer cells move sideways like a crab

d) Celsus, because tumors are red like a cooked crab

---

**Question 4:** What is the primary characteristic that defines a tumor as "malignant" and makes cancer particularly dangerous?

a) The size of the tumor exceeds 1 cm in diameter

b) The ability to both invade surrounding tissue and metastasize to distant sites

c) The presence of abnormal cell morphology

d) The increased rate of cell division

---

**Question 5:** According to the chapter, what percentage of newly diagnosed solid tumor patients can be cured by local therapeutic modalities alone?

a) More than two-thirds

b) Approximately one-half

c) Fewer than one-third

d) Less than one-tenth

---

**Question 6:** Which of the following is NOT one of the original six hallmarks of cancer?

a) Evading apoptosis

b) Sustained angiogenesis

c) Reprogramming of energy metabolism

d) Limitless replicative potential

---

**Question 7:** The two "enabling characteristics" that facilitate acquisition of cancer hallmarks are:

a) Mutation and selection

b) Angiogenesis and metastasis

c) Genomic instability and tumor-promoting inflammation

d) Proliferation and invasion

---

**Question 8:** Which of the following best distinguishes benign from malignant tumors?

a) Benign tumors are smaller than malignant tumors

b) Benign tumors remain confined to their original location and don't invade or metastasize

c) Benign tumors grow faster than malignant tumors

d) Benign tumors have more abnormal-appearing cells

---

**Question 9:** In the TNM staging system, what does the "M" represent?

a) Malignancy grade

b) Morphology of tumor cells

c) Metastases (distant spread)

d) Mitotic rate

---

**Question 10:** What percentage of cancers are estimated to be directly attributable to environmental and lifestyle factors, making them largely preventable?

a) More than 30%

b) More than 50%

c) More than 70%

d) More than 90%
