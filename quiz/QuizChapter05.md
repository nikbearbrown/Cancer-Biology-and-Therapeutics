# Chapter 5 Quiz: Oncogenes

## Instructions
Choose the best answer for each question. Each question tests understanding of key concepts from oncogenes.

**Question 1:** Acutely transforming retroviruses differ from chronic/weakly oncogenic retroviruses in that they:

a) Cannot infect cells

b) Can rapidly cause tumors within days and transform cell cultures to the neoplastic phenotype

c) Only infect non-dividing cells

d) Require decades to cause tumors

---

**Question 2:** The revolutionary discovery about viral oncogenes (v-onc) was that they:

a) Were entirely new genes created by viruses

b) Were captured and altered versions of normal cellular genes (proto-oncogenes)

c) Only existed in retroviruses

d) Had no cellular counterparts

---

**Question 3:** What are the three main genetic mechanisms that activate oncogenes in human cancers?

a) Methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation

b) Transcription, translation, and replication

c) Mutation, gene amplification, and chromosome rearrangements

d) Insertion, deletion, and inversion

---

**Question 4:** RAS genes are mutated in approximately what percentage of all human tumors?

a) About 5%

b) About 15%

c) About 30%

d) About 50%

---

**Question 5:** In pancreatic carcinoma specifically, the frequency of RAS mutations can be as high as:

a) 30%

b) 50%

c) 70%

d) 90%

---

**Question 6:** The Philadelphia chromosome, a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia, creates which fusion protein?

a) MYC-ABL

b) BCR-ABL

c) RAS-ABL

d) ErbB-ABL

---

**Question 7:** Gene amplification of N-myc is particularly associated with which type of cancer?

a) Breast cancer

b) Lung cancer

c) Neuroblastoma

d) Colorectal cancer

---

**Question 8:** Normal RAS proteins function as:

a) Structural proteins in the cell membrane

b) DNA repair enzymes

c) Molecular switches that relay signals from cell surface to other parts of the cell

d) Transcription factors that directly bind DNA

---

**Question 9:** The first FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib (Gleevec), was approved in 2001 to treat:

a) Breast cancer with HER2 amplification

b) Melanoma with BRAF mutations

c) Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia

d) Lung cancer with EGFR mutations

---

**Question 10:** Approximately how many total oncogenes have been identified that can contribute to abnormal behavior of malignant cells?

a) About 25

b) About 50

c) About 100

d) About 500
