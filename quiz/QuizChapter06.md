**Question 1:** When normal cells were fused with tumor cells in Henry Harris's 1969 experiments, what was the outcome?

a) The hybrid cells became more aggressive tumors

b) The hybrid cells were not capable of forming tumors in most cases

c) The normal cells became cancerous

d) Both cell types died immediately

---

**Question 2:** According to Knudson's "two-hit hypothesis" for retinoblastoma, what is required for tumor development?

a) Activation of one RB allele

b) Inactivation or loss of both RB alleles

c) Amplification of the RB gene

d) Methylation of one RB allele only

---

**Question 3:** Which tumor suppressor gene was the first to be molecularly cloned and identified in 1986?

a) TP53

b) RB1 (Retinoblastoma gene)

c) APC

d) BRCA1

---

**Question 4:** The TP53 gene is frequently inactivated in a wide variety of human cancers. Individuals who inherit one defective copy of TP53 develop which syndrome?

a) Lynch syndrome

b) Familial adenomatous polyposis

c) Li-Fraumeni syndrome

d) Cowden syndrome

---

**Question 5:** What is the primary molecular function of the APC protein in the Wnt signaling pathway?

a) It activates β-catenin to promote cell growth

b) It binds to β-catenin, preventing activation of growth-promoting genes

c) It directly activates TCF4 transcription factor

d) It promotes chromosome segregation during mitosis

---

**Question 6:** In familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), if left untreated, what is the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer?

a) About 25%

b) About 50%

c) About 75%

d) Almost 100%

---

**Question 7:** PARP inhibitors work through the principle of "synthetic lethality" in BRCA-mutated tumors. What does this mean?

a) The loss of both PARP and BRCA function leads to cell death, while loss of either alone is tolerable

b) PARP inhibitors directly activate BRCA proteins

c) PARP inhibitors prevent all DNA damage

d) BRCA proteins inhibit PARP function

---

**Question 8:** Which epigenetic mechanism is frequently involved in silencing tumor suppressor genes in cancer?

a) Histone acetylation of promoter regions

b) DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoter regions

c) Increased gene transcription

d) Enhanced mRNA stability

---

**Question 9:** The PTEN gene functions as which type of enzyme?

a) A kinase that adds phosphate groups

b) A methyltransferase

c) A phosphatase that removes phosphate groups

d) A protease that cleaves proteins

---

**Question 10:** Which of the following is NOT a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation?

a) Point mutations creating premature stop codons

b) Large chromosomal deletions causing loss of heterozygosity

c) Gene amplification leading to overexpression

d) DNA methylation causing epigenetic silencing
