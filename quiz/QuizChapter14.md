# Chapter 14 Quiz: The Tumor Microenvironment

## Instructions
Choose the best answer for each question. Each question tests understanding of key concepts from the tumor microenvironment chapter.

---

**Question 1:** Which of the following best describes the tumor microenvironment (TME)?
a) A simple collection of cancer cells grouped together
b) A complex, dynamic ecosystem of cancer cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, blood vessels, and extracellular matrix
c) Only the blood vessels that supply nutrients to tumors
d) The space immediately surrounding individual cancer cells

---

**Question 2:** What distinguishes cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from normal fibroblasts?
a) CAFs are smaller and less metabolically active
b) CAFs express α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and promote tumorigenesis
c) CAFs only produce collagen type IV
d) CAFs cannot respond to paracrine signals

---

**Question 3:** The "reverse Warburg effect" in the tumor microenvironment refers to:
a) Cancer cells using oxygen more efficiently than normal cells
b) Fibroblasts producing lactate and pyruvate that cancer cells use for energy
c) Cancer cells producing excess oxygen for stromal cells
d) Normal cells switching to glycolysis in the presence of tumors

---

**Question 4:** Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment typically:
a) Always suppress tumor growth through cytotoxic activity
b) Have no effect on tumor progression
c) Adopt an M2 phenotype that promotes tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression
d) Only function to remove dead cancer cells

---

**Question 5:** Considering that the oxygen diffusion distance is 100-200 microns, what tumor size necessitates the "angiogenic switch"?
a) Tumors smaller than 0.5mm in diameter
b) Tumors larger than 1mm in diameter
c) Tumors larger than 5mm in diameter
d) Tumors larger than 1cm in diameter

---

**Question 6:** Which growth factor is most directly stimulated by tissue hypoxia and low pH in the tumor microenvironment?
a) EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor)
b) PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)
c) VEGF-A (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A)
d) IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor-1)

---

**Question 7:** The desmoplastic reaction in tumors typically includes all of the following EXCEPT:
a) Extracellular matrix proteins (collagen types I and III, fibronectin)
b) Fibroblasts and stellate cells
c) Small endothelium-lined vessels
d) Mature, fully differentiated cancer cells

---

**Question 8:** When was the relationship between inflammation and cancer first recognized?
a) 1860s by Virchow
b) 1920s by Otto Warburg
c) 1970s by Carr and Underwood
d) Early 1900s through epidemiological studies

---

**Question 9:** Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the tumor microenvironment primarily function to:
a) Strengthen the extracellular matrix to prevent tumor spread
b) Produce new collagen fibers
c) Promote tumor cell migration and invasion by degrading ECM and releasing growth factors
d) Only remove damaged tissue components

---

**Question 10:** The bidirectional signaling between cancer cells and stromal cells involves:
a) Only cancer cells sending signals to stromal cells
b) Only stromal cells sending signals to cancer cells
c) Cancer cells releasing factors like TGF-β and Shh, while stromal cells release chemokines like IL-8 and MCP-1
d) No communication between these cell types
