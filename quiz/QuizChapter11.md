# Chapter 11 Quiz: Cancer Metabolism - The Warburg Effect and Beyond

## Instructions
Choose the best answer for each question. Each question tests understanding of key concepts from cancer metabolism.

---

**Question 1:** The Warburg effect describes a metabolic phenomenon in cancer cells where:

a) Cancer cells only use oxidative phosphorylation for energy

b) Cancer cells convert glucose to lactate even in the presence of adequate oxygen (aerobic glycolysis)

c) Cancer cells cannot use glucose for energy production

d) Cancer cells produce more ATP per glucose molecule than normal cells

---

**Question 2:** Why do cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis despite it being less efficient at producing ATP per glucose molecule?

a) Cancer cells have defective mitochondria that cannot function

b) The rate of glucose-to-lactate flux is much faster, and cancer cells need anabolic building blocks for rapid proliferation, not just ATP

c) Cancer cells cannot access oxygen in the tumor environment

d) Aerobic glycolysis produces more ATP than oxidative phosphorylation

---

**Question 3:** How is the Warburg effect clinically exploited in cancer diagnosis?

a) By measuring lactate levels in blood

b) Through PET imaging using radiolabeled glucose analog (FDG) that accumulates in rapidly dividing tumor cells

c) By testing for mitochondrial dysfunction

d) Through genetic testing for metabolic enzymes

---

**Question 4:** The "reverse Warburg effect" describes:

a) Cancer cells using oxidative phosphorylation instead of glycolysis

b) Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) undergoing aerobic glycolysis and providing metabolites like lactate to fuel cancer cells

c) The reversal of metabolic changes when cancer is treated

d) Normal cells becoming cancerous through metabolic changes

---

**Question 5:** Why is glutamine particularly important for cancer cell metabolism?

a) It is the only amino acid cancer cells can use

b) It serves as a nitrogen donor, precursor for biosynthesis, and its derivative α-ketoglutarate fuels the TCA cycle

c) It replaces glucose as the primary energy source

d) It prevents oxidative stress exclusively

---

**Question 6:** What role do mitochondria play in cancer cells, despite the Warburg effect?

a) No role - they are completely non-functional in cancer

b) They remain important for energy production, biosynthetic processes, and metabolizing both pyruvate and fatty acids

c) They only produce reactive oxygen species

d) They exclusively process lactate

---

**Question 7:** How do cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) support cancer cell metabolism?

a) They compete with cancer cells for nutrients

b) They secrete metabolites like lactate, alanine, and lipids through processes including autophagy, which cancer cells can use as fuel

c) They only provide structural support

d) They prevent cancer cells from accessing glucose

---

**Question 8:** In pancreatic cancer, why is alanine metabolism particularly important?

a) Alanine is toxic to normal cells but not cancer cells

b) Pancreatic stellate cells secrete alanine that cancer cells preferentially use to fuel the TCA cycle, allowing glucose to be redirected to biosynthetic pathways

c) Alanine prevents immune cell infiltration

d) Alanine blocks all other metabolic pathways

---

**Question 9:** What is a major challenge in therapeutically targeting cancer metabolism?

a) Cancer cells have no metabolic vulnerabilities

b) All metabolic inhibitors are too toxic to use

c) Cancer cells exhibit metabolic flexibility and heterogeneity, allowing them to adapt and use alternative pathways when one is blocked

d) Metabolic pathways are identical in cancer and normal cells

---

**Question 10:** Why might combination metabolic therapies be more effective than single-agent approaches?

a) They are less expensive to produce

b) Cancer cells can bypass single metabolic blockades by using alternative pathways, so targeting multiple nodes simultaneously prevents metabolic escape

c) Combination therapies work faster than single agents

d) They completely eliminate all side effects
