# Chapter 7 Quiz: Epigenetics in Cancer

## Instructions
Choose the best answer for each question. Each question tests understanding of key concepts from epigenetics in cancer.

---

**Question 1:** Epigenetics is best defined as:

a) Changes in DNA sequence that alter gene function

b) Heritable and stable changes in gene expression through alterations in chromosome structure rather than DNA sequence

c) Mutations that cause cancer development

d) Changes in RNA sequence during transcription

---

**Question 2:** What are the three main epigenetic mechanisms identified that play crucial roles in cancer development?

a) Transcription, translation, and replication

b) Mutation, deletion, and insertion

c) DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA-associated gene silencing

d) Phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination only

---

**Question 3:** In cancer, DNA methylation patterns are typically disrupted in two major ways. Which statement correctly describes these changes?

a) Global hypermethylation and promoter hypomethylation

b) Global hypomethylation (genomic instability) and promoter hypermethylation (tumor suppressor gene silencing)

c) Only promoter hypermethylation occurs

d) DNA methylation patterns remain unchanged in cancer

---

**Question 4:** The basic unit of chromatin, consisting of DNA wrapped around histone proteins, is called:

a) A chromosome

b) A centromere

c) A nucleosome

d) A telomere

---

**Question 5:** Which of the following is NOT a type of histone modification?

a) Acetylation

b) Methylation

c) Phosphorylation

d) Replication

---

**Question 6:** MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules approximately how many nucleotides in length?

a) 5-10 nucleotides

b) 18-25 nucleotides

c) 100-150 nucleotides

d) 500-1000 nucleotides

---

**Question 7:** What was the first FDA-approved epigenetic drug, marking a milestone in 2004?

a) Vorinostat

b) Tazemetostat

c) Azacitidine

d) Decitabine

---

**Question 8:** In glioma, promoter hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing of which gene has been associated with better response to temozolomide?

a) TP53

b) BRCA1

c) MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase)

d) RB1

---

**Question 9:** What percentage of bladder cancer patients have mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation?

a) About 20%

b) About 40%

c) About 60%

d) Almost 80%

---

**Question 10:** Which of the following best describes why epigenetic therapies are particularly promising for cancer treatment?

a) Epigenetic changes are permanent and cannot be reversed

b) Epigenetic changes are reversible, allowing recovery of function for affected genes with normal DNA sequences

c) Epigenetic drugs only work on genetic mutations

d) Epigenetic changes do not affect gene expression
