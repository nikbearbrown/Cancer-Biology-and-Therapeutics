**Question 2:** The four discrete phases of the eukaryotic cell cycle are:

a) G1 (Gap 1), G2(Gap 2), S (Synthesis), and Prophase

b) M (Mitosis), G1 (Gap 1), S (Synthesis), and G2 (Gap 2)

c) Interphase, Prophase, Metaphase, and Anaphase

d) G0 (Gap 0), G1 (Gap 1), G2 (Gap 2), and M (Mitosis)

---

**Question 3:** For a typical rapidly proliferating human cell with a 24-hour cycle time, approximately what percentage of time is spent in mitosis (M phase)?

a) About 4% (1 hour)

b) About 17% (4 hours)

c) About 33% (8 hours)

d) About 46% (11 hours)

---

**Question 4:** Which two major types of proteins regulate the cell cycle?

a) Histones and telomerases

b) Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)

c) p53 and p21 only

d) RNA polymerases and DNA polymerases

---

**Question 5:** The G1 checkpoint blocks progression into S phase primarily by:

a) Destroying all cyclins in the cell

b) Inhibiting the activation of G1/S-Cdk and S-Cdk complexes

c) Preventing DNA polymerase from functioning

d) Blocking ribosome production

---

**Question 6:** Which tumor suppressor protein plays a crucial role in promoting growth arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis in response to cellular damage?

a) INK4a

b) Bcl-2

c) p53

d) Cyclin D

---

**Question 7:** What is the primary difference between apoptosis and necrosis?

a) Apoptosis is programmed cell death triggered by internal signals; necrosis is uncontrolled death from external pathological factors

b) Apoptosis only occurs in cancer cells; necrosis occurs in normal cells

c) Apoptosis causes inflammation; necrosis does not

d) Apoptosis is faster than necrosis

---

**Question 8:** The mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis involves the release of which protein into the cytosol?

a) Caspase-3

b) Cytochrome c

c) Bcl-2

d) p53

---

**Question 9:** Cancer cells are defined by two heritable properties. Which of the following best describes these properties?

a) They grow slowly and remain localized to one tissue

b) They require more oxygen and nutrients than normal cells

c) They reproduce in defiance of normal restraints and invade territories reserved for other cells

d) They have larger nuclei and produce more proteins

---

**Question 10:** Why don't single mutations typically cause cancer in humans despite approximately 10^16 cell divisions occurring in a lifetime?

a) The immune system destroys all mutated cells immediately

b) Mutations only occur in non-dividing cells

c) Cancer genesis typically requires several independent, rare accidents to occur in the lineage of one cell

d) Normal cells cannot undergo mutations
