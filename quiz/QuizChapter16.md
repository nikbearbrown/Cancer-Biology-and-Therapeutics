# Chapter 16 Quiz: Tumor Immunology

## Instructions
Choose the best answer for each question. Each question tests understanding of key concepts from tumor immunology.

---

**Question 1:** The concept of "immune surveillance" proposes that:

a) The immune system only responds to infections, not cancer

b) The immune system promotes cancer growth

c) All cancer cells are immediately destroyed by the immune system

d) The immune system can detect and eliminate transformed cells, but tumor development represents failure of this surveillance

---

**Question 2:** Why is immune surveillance particularly effective against virus-associated tumors but less effective against most spontaneous tumors?

a) Spontaneous tumors grow too quickly

b) Viral antigens are foreign (non-self) and highly immunogenic, while antigens from spontaneous genetic alterations often resemble self-antigens and may be subject to immune tolerance

c) Virus-associated tumors are always smaller

d) The immune system only recognizes viral proteins

---

**Question 3:** What are neoantigens and why are they ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy?

a) Normal proteins expressed at high levels in tumors

b) Viral proteins in cancer cells

c) Tumor-specific antigens generated by somatic mutations that are unique to cancer cells, absent from normal tissues, and not subject to central tolerance

d) Proteins found only on immune cells

---

**Question 4:** Natural killer (NK) cells selectively kill target cells through "missing self" recognition. What does this mean?

a) NK cells kill all cells they encounter

b) NK cells kill cells expressing low levels of MHC class I proteins, which allows them to target tumor cells that downregulate MHC to evade T cells

c) NK cells only kill foreign cells

d) NK cells require antibodies to function

---

**Question 5:** T-cell exhaustion is a state of dysfunction that occurs in cancer. What characterizes exhausted T cells?

a) Complete loss of all function and immediate cell death

b) Enhanced killing ability and rapid proliferation

c) Progressive loss of effector functions, sustained expression of multiple inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3), and altered transcriptional programming due to chronic antigen stimulation

d) Transformation into regulatory T cells

---

**Question 6:** How do immune checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD-1 antibodies work to treat cancer?

a) They directly kill cancer cells

b) They block the interaction between PD-1 on T cells and PD-L1 on tumor cells, releasing the "brakes" on T-cell activation and restoring anti-tumor immune responses

c) They activate the immune system non-specifically

d) They prevent tumor cells from dividing

---

**Question 7:** Approximately what percentage of patients with immunogenic cancers respond to current immune checkpoint blockade therapies?

a) About 5-10%

b) About 20-40%

c) About 60-80%

d) Nearly 100%

---

**Question 8:** CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor) T-cell therapy has achieved remarkable success in which type of malignancies?

a) Primarily hematological malignancies such as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphomas

b) Only solid tumors like lung and breast cancer

c) Only brain tumors

d) All cancer types equally

---

**Question 9:** Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs) contribute to cancer progression by:

a) Directly killing cancer cells

b) Creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment that suppresses anti-tumor immune responses and promotes tumor growth

c) Preventing angiogenesis

d) Enhancing chemotherapy effectiveness

---

**Question 10:** Why do tumors often express PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand 1) on their surface?

a) To attract more immune cells to the tumor

b) To enhance antigen presentation

c) To promote their own cell death

d) To suppress effector T-cell function by engaging the inhibitory PD-1 receptor on T cells, thereby evading immune destruction
