# Chapter 31: Solid Tumors by Organ/System

Cancer represents a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Understanding the organ-specific manifestations of solid tumors is essential for medical and nursing professionals, as each tumor type presents unique epidemiological patterns, pathophysiology, diagnostic challenges, and therapeutic approaches. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the most clinically significant solid tumors, organized by organ system.

## 31.1 Breast Cancer

### 31.1.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women and the second most common cause of death from cancer among women worldwide. As of 2020, breast cancer has become the most diagnosed cancer globally, overtaking lung and prostate cancers. In the UK, breast cancer represents almost a third of all newly diagnosed cancers, with a crude incidence rate of 76.3 per 100,000 persons, though all except 287 cases were found in women.

Most breast cancer is sporadic (90%-95%), with only 5% to 10% of patients having an identifiable genetic mutation. BRCA 1 and 2 are the most common associated genetic conditions. There are no pathognomonic features distinguishing breast and ovarian cancers occurring in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants from those occurring in noncarriers.

### 31.1.2 Pathology and Molecular Subtypes

Histopathologic Classification

Breast cancer represents a highly heterogeneous disease encompassing diverse pathologic and molecular entities. The two predominant invasive histologic types are:

**Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC):**

- Represents approximately 70-80% of invasive breast cancers
- Designated as "not otherwise specified" (NOS) when lacking specific features
- Originates from ductal epithelium
- Variable morphologic patterns and biological behaviors

**Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC):**

- Comprises 10-15% of invasive breast cancers
- Characterized by single-file pattern of invasion
- Loss of E-cadherin expression
- Tendency for multifocality and contralateral involvement
- Distinct metastatic patterns (bone, gastrointestinal tract, peritoneum, ovary)

### Molecular Classification: The Intrinsic Subtypes

Gene expression profiling revolutionized breast cancer classification in the early 2000s, revealing that breast cancer comprises several distinct biologic entities that are only partially captured by immunohistochemical markers.

**Historical Development:**

In landmark studies by Perou and colleagues, cDNA microarrays were used to subclassify breast cancers into four broad clusters based on gene expression profiles:

- Luminal/ER gene cluster
- ERBB2 overexpression cluster (ERBB2+)
- Basal epithelial-associated cluster
- Normal breast-like cluster

Subsequent analyses revealed further subdivision of the luminal subtype based on differential expression of luminal-specific genes and ER cluster genes, giving rise to luminal A and luminal B designations. These five distinct molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, ERBB2-enriched/HER2-enriched, basal-like, and normal breast-like) became known as the "intrinsic" molecular subtypes of breast cancer.

**The PAM50 Gene Signature:**

A 50-gene molecular signature (PAM50) was developed for clinical use in prognosis and treatment decisions, enabling molecular subtype classification from gene expression data. This signature has been validated across numerous studies and integrated into clinical practice through commercially available assays.

### Clinical-Molecular Subtype Integration

**Immunohistochemical Approximation:**

While gene expression profiling provides the most accurate subtype classification, practical clinical implementation relies on immunohistochemistry (IHC) to approximate molecular subtypes:

**Luminal A:**

- *IHC Profile:* ER-positive and/or PR-positive, HER2-negative, Ki-67 low (<14-20% depending on assay)
- *Gene Expression:* High expression of ER-related genes, luminal cytokeratins (CK8/18), and genes associated with ER activation
- *Characteristics:* Best prognosis among breast cancer subtypes, typically low-grade, slow-growing
- *Treatment Response:* Highly responsive to endocrine therapy
- *Prognosis:* 5-year survival rates exceeding 90% for early-stage disease
- *Recurrence Pattern:* Low initial recurrence rate (1.5% local, 0.7% regional), but can recur even after 10 years requiring extended surveillance

**Luminal B:**

- *IHC Profile:* ER-positive and/or PR-positive, and either:
  - HER2-positive (Luminal B/HER2-positive), or
  - HER2-negative with Ki-67 high (≥14-20%), or PR-negative/low (<20%)
- *Gene Expression:* Expression of ER-related genes but with higher proliferation signatures and lower ER cluster gene expression than Luminal A
- *Characteristics:* More aggressive than Luminal A, higher proliferation rates, intermediate prognosis
- *Treatment Response:* Responsive to endocrine therapy but often requires chemotherapy; HER2-positive variants require anti-HER2 therapy
- *Prognosis:* Intermediate survival outcomes; recurrence rates of 2.9% local and 1.5% regional
- *Distinguishing Features:* PR cut-point of ≥20% best corresponds to Luminal A; PR <20% suggests Luminal B

**HER2-Enriched:**

- *IHC Profile:* ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-positive (3+ by IHC or amplified by FISH/ISH)
- *Gene Expression:* Characteristic overexpression of genes in ERBB2 amplicon on chromosome 17, including ERBB2 (HER2), GRB7, and others
- *Important Note:* Not all clinically HER2-positive tumors (by IHC/FISH) are molecularly HER2-enriched; some fall into luminal categories
- *Characteristics:* Aggressive behavior without targeted therapy, tendency for brain and visceral metastases
- *Treatment Response:* Dramatic responses to anti-HER2 targeted therapies; transformed from worst to favorable prognosis with trastuzumab
- *Prognosis:* With modern HER2-directed therapy, outcomes approach or exceed Luminal B; highest local recurrence rate (7.5%) and regional recurrence (3.4%)

**Basal-Like:**

- *IHC Approximation:* Triple-negative (ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-negative) in approximately 86% of cases, though not all TNBCs are basal-like
- *Gene Expression:* Overexpression of basal cytokeratins (CK5, CK17), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-related genes, proliferation genes
- *Characteristics:* Most aggressive subtype, younger age at diagnosis, higher nuclear grade, increased mitotic activity
- *Treatment Response:* Lack of targeted therapy options; reliant on chemotherapy
- *Prognosis:* Worst prognosis overall; 5-year survival significantly lower than hormone receptor-positive subtypes; recurrence rates of 7.6% local and 3.3% regional
- *Paradoxical Sensitivity:* Despite poor prognosis, can show high initial chemotherapy response rates, though responses often not durable

**Normal Breast-Like:**

- *Controversy:* Disputed existence as true subtype vs technical artifact from normal tissue contamination
- *Evidence:* Large series using microdissection to isolate neoplastic cells found no normal breast-like cases
- *Characteristics:* Gene expression resembling adipose tissue, intermediate prognosis, typically lack ER/PR/HER2 expression but distinct from basal-like
- *Clinical Significance:* Uncertain and not routinely used for clinical decision-making

### Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Heterogeneity

TNBC (10-30% of all breast cancers) demonstrates substantial heterogeneity despite shared IHC characteristics:

**Morphologic Variants:**

- Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NOS (most common)
- Medullary carcinoma (better prognosis)
- Adenoid cystic carcinoma (favorable prognosis, rare)
- Metaplastic carcinoma (poor prognosis)
- Apocrine carcinoma
- Secretory carcinoma

**Molecular TNBC Subtypes (Lehmann Classification):**

Initial classification identified seven TNBC subtypes:

- **Basal-like 1 and 2 (BL1, BL2):** Enriched for proliferation genes, DNA damage response
- **Immunomodulatory (IM):** Overexpressing immune signaling genes, high immune cell infiltration
- **Luminal androgen receptor (LAR):** AR-positive with AR-activated gene expression, resembling luminal breast cancers
- **Mesenchymal (M) and Mesenchymal stem-like (MSL):** Characterized by cell motility, angiogenesis-related genes, epithelial-mesenchymal transition features
- **Unstable subtype:** Not further characterizable

**Molecular Apocrine Subtype:**

- ER-negative but AR-positive (>1% nuclear staining)
- Often manifest as apocrine carcinoma morphologically (>90% cells with apocrine features)
- Gene expression profile overlapping with luminal, basal-like, and HER2-positive groups
- Potential target for AR-directed therapies
- Seen in 10-15% of TNBCs

**Clinical and Epidemiological Heterogeneity:**

- Overrepresented among Black and premenopausal women
- Black women under 50 have 37% chance of basal-like breast cancer vs 25% chance of Luminal A
- White women over 50 have 15% chance of basal-like vs 52% chance of Luminal A
- Despite TNBC's aggressive nature overall, some subtypes are more indolent

### Concordance Between IHC and Molecular Subtypes

Important discordances exist between clinical IHC classification and molecular subtypes:

**HER2-Positive Discordance:**

- 60% of clinically HER2-positive (by IHC) tumors are not molecularly HER2-enriched
- HER2-positive by IHC but Luminal A or B molecularly show poor response to trastuzumab-chemotherapy (8% pCR rate)
- True molecular HER2-enriched tumors show 54% pCR rate with trastuzumab combinations
- Highlights limitations of IHC alone for treatment prediction

**Luminal Classification Challenges:**

- ER-positive tumors by IHC: 73% molecularly luminal, 11% HER2-enriched, 5% basal-like, 12% normal-like
- PR status and endocrine responsiveness index do not accurately subdivide into Luminal A vs B
- Ki-67 proliferation marker (≥14-20% cutoff) helps differentiate but lacks standardization
- St. Gallen 2013 and 2015 classifications incorporated Ki-67 and PR thresholds

### Clinical Implications of Molecular Subtypes

**Prognostic Significance:**

- Luminal A: best prognosis, lowest recurrence risk
- Luminal B: intermediate prognosis
- HER2-enriched: variable prognosis based on treatment; excellent with anti-HER2 therapy
- Basal-like: worst prognosis overall
- Analysis from TCGA confirms basal-like as unique subtype with worst outcomes

**Treatment Implications:**

- Luminal A and B: sensitive to targeted endocrine treatments
- HER2-enriched: sensitive to anti-HER2 therapies (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, T-DM1, T-DXd)
- Basal-like/TNBC: currently reliant on chemotherapy, emerging immunotherapy options
- LAR subtype TNBC: potential for AR-targeted therapy under investigation

**Emerging Biomarkers:**

- Differentially expressed genes: RASD

F7 (Luminal A), DCTPP1 (Luminal B), DHRS11/KLC3/NAGA3/TMEM98 (HER2), ABHD14A/ADSSL1 (TNBC)

- Long non-coding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins for each subtype
- Providing preliminary evidence for new prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets
- microRNAs (let-7, miR-155, miR-150, miR-153) with subtype-specific expression
- Mutations in p53, BRCA1/2 with different prevalence across subtypes

### Molecular Subtype Plasticity

**Dynamic Changes During Treatment:**

- Molecular subtype can shift during therapy
- Example: HER2-positive converting to triple-negative during trastuzumab treatment
- 18% of initially ER-negative HER2+ tumors converted to ER+ after 2 weeks of lapatinib therapy
- Demonstrates pathway interconnection and resistance mechanisms
- Recommendation: Repeat immunohistochemical evaluation in case of relapse or progression

### Pathway Crosstalk in HR+/HER2+ Disease

Approximately 50% of HER2-positive breast cancers also express hormone receptors, creating unique therapeutic challenges and opportunities:

**Bidirectional Pathway Interactions:**

- HER2 pathway activation can interfere with ER expression and activity
- Represents escape pathway from endocrine therapy in HR+ disease
- Conversely, ER signaling can reduce sensitivity to anti-HER2 therapy
- Patients with high ER expression (>50% ER and PR) show reduced benefit from trastuzumab addition
- Complex molecular crosstalk affects response to both targeted therapies

### 31.1.3 Staging and Prognosis

Evolution of Breast Cancer Staging

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system has been the universal standard for cancer classification since its inception in 1959. The system has undergone eight editions, with the most significant paradigm shift occurring in the 8th edition (2017), which fundamentally reconceptualized breast cancer staging by integrating biomarkers with anatomic extent of disease.

### Anatomic TNM Staging

**Traditional Anatomic Components:**

The anatomic staging system remains essential for continuity and regions where biomarkers are not routinely available:

*Tumor Size (T):*

- Tis: Carcinoma in situ
- T1: Tumor ≤20 mm (subdivided: T1mi ≤1mm, T1a >1-5mm, T1b >5-10mm, T1c >10-20mm)
- T2: Tumor >20 mm but ≤50 mm
- T3: Tumor >50 mm
- T4: Any size with chest wall/skin extension

*Regional Lymph Nodes (N):*

- N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
- N1: 1-3 axillary lymph nodes involved
- N2: 4-9 axillary lymph nodes involved
- N3: ≥10 axillary lymph nodes or involvement of infraclavicular, supraclavicular, or internal mammary nodes

*Distant Metastasis (M):*

- M0: No distant metastasis
- M1: Distant metastasis present

### Prognostic Staging: The Revolutionary Integration

The 8th edition AJCC staging system represents a fundamental change, recognizing breast cancer as a group of diseases with different molecular characteristics indicating different prognoses, patterns of recurrence, dissemination, and sensitivities to available therapies.

**Biomarkers Integrated into Staging:**

*Histologic Grade:*

- Grade 1 (well-differentiated): Best prognosis
- Grade 2 (moderately differentiated): Intermediate prognosis
- Grade 3 (poorly differentiated): Worst prognosis
- Impacts stage assignment, with grade 3 tumors assigned higher stages

*Hormone Receptor Status:*

- ER (estrogen receptor) expression
- PR (progesterone receptor) expression
- Positivity threshold: ≥1% nuclear staining by IHC
- Both ER and PR expression associated with better prognosis
- PR <20% may indicate Luminal B despite ER positivity

*HER2 Status:*

- Assessed by IHC (3+ positive, 2+ equivocal requiring FISH/ISH, 0-1+ negative)
- Gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or in situ hybridization (ISH)
- HER2-negative status without endocrine receptor expression (triple-negative) associated with worse prognosis
- HER2-positive status associated with favorable prognosis when treated with anti-HER2 therapy

*Multigene Panel Testing:*

- Oncotype DX Recurrence Score incorporated in limited situations
- Low scores (<11 for node-negative disease, <25 for 1-3 positive nodes) can downstage patients
- Other panels (MammaPrint, EndoPredict, PAM50, Breast Cancer Index) show similar utility but not yet incorporated into AJCC staging
- Provide additional prognostic and predictive information

### Clinical and Pathologic Prognostic Stages

**Clinical Prognostic Stage:**

- Applicable to all patients with primary breast cancer before any treatment
- Requires clinical and imaging evaluation
- Biopsy with grade and ER, PR, HER2 results
- Guides neoadjuvant therapy decisions

**Pathologic Prognostic Stage:**

- Applicable to patients treated with complete surgical excision as first treatment
- Used throughout the United States for patients undergoing surgery as initial treatment
- Requires complete pathology report with grade, ER, PR, HER2
- Most accurate for long-term prognosis

**Post-Neoadjuvant Therapy Staging (yp):**

- Prefix "yc" for clinical staging after neoadjuvant therapy
- Prefix "yp" for pathologic staging after neoadjuvant therapy
- Pathologic complete response (ypT0N0M0) strong prognostic indicator
- Residual cancer burden assessment providing additional prognostic information

### Impact of Biomarker Integration

**Refined Risk Stratification:**

Analysis of large datasets demonstrates superior prognostic accuracy with biomarker-integrated staging:

*MD Anderson Cancer Center Study (n=3,327):*

- Incorporation of grade, ER, and HER2 into prognostic staging provided more refined stratification
- Improved disease-specific survival prediction compared to anatomic stage alone
- Risk profiles identified using high tumor grade, ER-negative, HER2-negative status

*California Cancer Registry Analysis (n=54,727):*

- AJCC 8th edition prognostic stage provided more accurate prognostic information than anatomic stage
- Better distribution of prognostic groups
- More precise individual prognostication

*Stage Migration Effects:*

- Applying pathologic prognostic stage groups changed stage grouping of almost 40% of patients
- Some patients downstaged (favorable biology despite larger anatomic extent)
- Some patients upstaged (unfavorable biology despite smaller anatomic extent)

**Subtype-Specific Staging Considerations:**

*Triple-Negative Phenotype:*

- National Cancer Data Base analysis: triple-negative tumors should be categorized at least one stage higher than other subtypes regardless of grade
- Triple-negative status significantly worsens prognosis in advanced stages (Stage III: HR 3.08; Stage IV: HR 24.36)
- Less impact on prognosis in earlier stages (I and II)
- Reflects aggressive biology and limited targeted treatment options

*Favorable Biology Downstaging:*

- Small, node-positive tumors with excellent biology (ER+/PR+, HER2-, Grade 1, low Oncotype DX) may be assigned to lower prognostic stages
- Patients with T1N1 disease and favorable markers may have Stage IB prognostic stage vs Stage IIA anatomic stage

### Prognostic Factors Beyond TNM

**Lymphovascular Invasion (LVI):**

- Presence associated with increased risk of nodal metastasis and recurrence
- Independent prognostic factor
- Influences adjuvant therapy decisions

**Oncotype DX Recurrence Score:**

- 21-gene assay providing recurrence risk assessment
- Low risk (<11, or <26 in some contexts): excellent prognosis, chemotherapy may be spared
- Intermediate risk: variable recommendations
- High risk (>25): chemotherapy beneficial
- TAILORx trial demonstrated chemotherapy benefit primarily in high-risk scores
- Integrated into AJCC 8th edition staging in select scenarios

**Proliferation Markers:**

- Ki-67 index: percentage of proliferating cells
- Higher Ki-67 associated with worse prognosis
- Cutoff of 14-20% distinguishing Luminal A from B
- Lack of standardization limits universal application

### Survival Outcomes by Molecular Subtype and Stage

**General Principles:**

- TNM stage remains significant predictor of overall survival across subtypes
- Stage II: HR 1.41; Stage III: HR 3.96; Stage IV: HR 27.25 (compared to Stage I)
- Biomarkers primarily improve accuracy in advanced stages
- Age also independent predictor (HR 1.05 per year)

**Subtype-Specific Outcomes:**

- Luminal A: Best outcomes at all stages
- Triple-negative and basal-like: Worst outcomes, particularly in advanced disease
- HER2-enriched: Transformed outcomes with targeted therapy
- Within-subtype racial disparities exist, greatest among hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease
- 
### 31.1.4 Treatment Approaches

Treatment Paradigms by Stage and Subtype

Breast cancer treatment has evolved from one-size-fits-all approaches to highly personalized, biology-driven strategies. Treatment selection depends on stage, molecular subtype, patient factors, and increasingly, on comprehensive genomic and biomarker profiling.

### Early-Stage Breast Cancer Treatment

**Definition:** Tumors <5 cm without clinically positive lymph nodes (Stage I-II)

**Surgical Management:**

*Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS):*

- Partial mastectomy, lumpectomy, or wide local excision
- Appropriate for early-stage tumors with favorable size-to-breast ratio
- Requires clear margins (no tumor on ink)
- Mandatory radiation therapy to remaining breast tissue
- Oncologic outcomes equivalent to mastectomy when combined with radiation

*Total Mastectomy:*

- Indicated for multifocal disease, unfavorable tumor-to-breast size ratio, contraindications to radiation
- Options include skin-sparing and nipple-sparing approaches
- Immediate or delayed reconstruction available

*Axillary Management:*

- Sentinel lymph node biopsy standard for clinically node-negative disease
- Axillary lymph node dissection for node-positive disease (though de-escalation trends emerging)
- ACOSOG Z0011 trial: limited axillary surgery in select patients with 1-2 positive sentinel nodes

**Radiation Therapy:**

- Mandatory after breast-conserving surgery
- Reduces local recurrence risk
- May be omitted in highly selected low-risk patients
- Post-mastectomy radiation for high-risk features (T3-4, N2-3, or 1-3 positive nodes with adverse features)
- Hypofractionated regimens (shorter course, higher dose per fraction) increasingly standard

**Systemic Therapy by Subtype:**

**Luminal A (ER+/PR+, HER2-, low Ki-67):**

*Endocrine Therapy:*

- **Premenopausal:** Tamoxifen (20 mg daily) for 5-10 years, with or without ovarian suppression
  
  - SOFT/TEXT trials: Ovarian suppression + aromatase inhibitor (AI) vs tamoxifen
  - Benefits greatest in high-risk premenopausal patients
  - Tamoxifen superior to AI in HR+/HER2+ disease (3.2% absolute DFS benefit at 8 years)
- **Postmenopausal:** Aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole 1 mg, letrozole 2.5 mg, exemestane 25 mg daily) for 5-10 years
  
  - Meta-analysis: AIs superior to tamoxifen in reducing recurrence and mortality
  - Extended therapy beyond 5 years in high-risk patients
  - Tamoxifen alternative if AI contraindicated or not tolerated

*Chemotherapy Consideration:*

- Generally omitted in low-risk Luminal A disease
- Oncotype DX and other genomic assays guiding decisions
- TAILORx trial: chemotherapy benefit limited to high recurrence scores
- Patient age and preferences considered

**Luminal B (ER+, HER2- with high Ki-67 or HER2+):**

  - Pertuzumab + trastuzumab + chemotherapy for high-risk disease
- **Chemotherapy:** Anthracycline and taxane-based regimens
  
  - Concurrent vs sequential with trastuzumab
  - Various effective combinations
- **Endocrine Therapy:** Incorporated into treatment plan
  
  - Preclinical and clinical data support concurrent anti-HER2 and endocrine therapy
  - Addresses bidirectional pathway crosstalk
  - Extended endocrine therapy (5-10 years)

**HER2-Enriched (ER-/PR-, HER2+):**

*Anti-HER2 Directed Therapy:*

- **Adjuvant Trastuzumab:** Standard 1-year therapy dramatically improving outcomes
- **Dual HER2 Blockade:** Pertuzumab + trastuzumab + chemotherapy for high-risk disease
  - APHINITY trial: Benefit in node-positive or hormone receptor-negative disease
- **T-DM1 (Ado-trastuzumab emtansine):** Antibody-drug conjugate for residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy
  - KATHERINE trial: Reduced recurrence risk by 50% compared to trastuzumab alone

*Chemotherapy:*

### Resistance and Treatment Sequencing

**Endocrine Resistance:**

- ESR1 mutations emerging during AI therapy
- PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation
- CDK4/6 pathway alterations
- Loss of ER expression
- Sequencing through endocrine options before chemotherapy when possible

**HER2 Therapy Resistance:**

- Mechanisms: PI3K pathway activation, alternative receptor activation, HER2 mutations
- Sequencing through multiple HER2-directed agents
- T-DXd effective after trastuzumab and T-DM1 progression

 ### Conclusion

Breast cancer treatment has entered an era of unprecedented precision, with molecular subtype, stage, and individual tumor biology guiding therapy selection. Integration of targeted therapies (endocrine, anti-HER2, CDK4/6 inhibitors, PARP inhibitors), immunotherapy, and conventional modalities offers improved outcomes across subtypes. Ongoing challenges include optimizing treatment sequences, managing resistance, expanding targeted options for TNBC, and ensuring global access to advanced therapies. Future directions involve further biomarker refinement, novel targeted agents, combination strategies, and truly personalized approaches integrating comprehensive multi-omic profiling.

## 31.2 Lung Cancer

### 31.2.1 Epidemiology and Classification

Lung cancer or bronchogenic carcinoma refers to tumors originating in the lung parenchyma or within the bronchi. It is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Since 1987, lung cancer has been responsible for more deaths in women than breast cancer. Lung cancer is a diagnosis that approximately 230,000 United States citizens will receive annually. Deaths are estimated at 135,000 patients per year.

Lung cancer is histologically divided into 2 main types: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC comprises about 15% of lung cancer while NSCLC comprises approximately 85%.

### 31.2.2 Risk Factors

Approximately 80% of lung cancer cases in men and 90% of cases in women are associated with smoking. SCC is more strongly associated with smoking than any other type of NSCLC. Other risk factors for SCC include age, family history, exposure to second-hand smoke, and exposure to minerals, metal particles, or asbestos.

### 31.2.3 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

**Pathological Subtypes**:
Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common primary lung cancer seen in the United States. It falls under the umbrella of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has a strong association with previous smoking. Adenocarcinoma of the lung usually evolves from the mucosal glands and represents about 40% of all lung cancers.

Adenosquamous carcinomas are lung tumors with more than 10% glandular and squamous components. This is an uncommon and highly aggressive lung tumor, and current recommendations propose adjuvant chemotherapy even in Stage I radically resected tumors.

**Staging and Prognosis**:
Metabolic activity on PET scan has been shown to have a poor prognosis in stages I-IV NSCLC. Recurrence after complete resection has been cited at 41 percent, with the median time to recurrence at 11.5 months and median survival of 8.1 months.

### 31.2.4 Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)

The main criteria for determining LD and ED are whether a reasonable radiation plan can safely encompass disease extent. Two-thirds of patients present with extensive stage or metastatic disease.

Close to 70% of patients with small cell lung cancer have disseminated disease at the time of presentation.

### 31.2.5 Treatment Approaches

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Treatment Paradigm

The treatment of non-small cell lung cancer has undergone a transformative shift over the past two decades, driven by the identification of actionable driver mutations and the development of targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Since 2024, 11 FDA approvals have further revolutionized NSCLC management, ushering in an era of personalized treatment with substantially improved patient outcomes.

NSCLC is now recognized not as a singular entity but as multiple pathologies with unique molecular signatures. Approximately 50% of tumors harbor critical driver mutations that, when successfully targeted, lead to rapid tumor regressions and prolonged survival. Treatment selection is based on tumor stage, histology (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma), molecular profile, patient performance status, and comorbidities.

### Early-Stage NSCLC (Stages I-II)

**Stage IA and IB Treatment:**

*Surgical Management:*

- Surgery is the treatment of choice for stage I NSCLC
- **Lobectomy:** Standard surgical approach removing affected lobe

- Antibody-drug conjugates
- Targeting specific molecular subtypes (ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, YAP1)
- Epigenetic modifiers

*Challenges:*

- High number of somatic mutations but lack of obvious actionable drivers
- Genomic profiling has not identified clear mutationally defined subtypes
- Progress slower than NSCLC due to lack of targetable biomarkers
- Inherent heterogeneity and rapid resistance development

### General Principles for NSCLC Management

**Molecular Profiling:**

- **Essential at diagnosis** for all advanced nonsquamous NSCLC
- **Recommended for squamous** NSCLC (particularly never-smokers, young patients, small biopsies)
- **Key alterations to test:** EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, RET, NTRK, KRAS, HER2/ERBB2, NRG1
- **PD-L1 expression:** If no driver mutation identified
- **Next-generation sequencing (NGS):** Enabling comprehensive profiling
- **Liquid biopsy:** Alternative when tissue insufficient

**Treatment Sequencing:**

- Driver mutation-positive: Targeted therapy first-line, chemotherapy or immunotherapy at progression
- Driver mutation-negative: Immunotherapy ± chemotherapy based on PD-L1
- Multiple lines of therapy available, extending overall survival to 2-3+ years in some patients

**Supportive Care:**

- Management of treatment-related toxicities (tyrosine kinase inhibitor rash/diarrhea, checkpoint inhibitor immune-related adverse events)
- Palliative radiation for symptomatic metastases
- Multidisciplinary supportive oncology

### Future Directions in Lung Cancer

- Expanding targeted therapies to squamous NSCLC (progress has lagged)
- Combination immunotherapy strategies
- Overcoming resistance to targeted therapies and immunotherapy
- Neoadjuvant/perioperative approaches in earlier stages
- Minimal residual disease monitoring guiding therapy
- Cellular therapies (CAR-T, TILs) under investigation
  
## 31.3 Colorectal Cancer

### 31.3.1 Epidemiology and Natural History

In the United States, colon cancer is diagnosed in approximately 100,000 patients and rectal cancer is diagnosed in another 50,000 each year. These cancers most commonly affect older adults, with 90 percent of cases diagnosed in individuals older than 50 years. Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignant tumor and the fourth most common cause of cancer death in the world.

Most colorectal cancers develop slowly over decades. The process involves a gradual accumulation of genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations. The first histologically detectable change is development of aberrant crypt foci in the lining of the intestine.

### 31.3.2 Pathology and Molecular Features

The pathological histological types mainly include papillary adenocarcinoma, tubular adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, signet-ring cell carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and carcinoid carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma has the highest incidence, accounting for more than 90%.

This process often involves abnormal changes of multiple genes, such as APC, DCC, P53, K-RAS, C-MYC, BRAF, MCC, and MMR-related genes.

### 31.3.3 Staging System

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) 2017 is currently the preferred staging system for colorectal cancer.

**TNM Classification**:
- **T1**: Tumor invades the submucosa (through the muscularis mucosa but not into the muscularis propria)
- **T3**: Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues
- **T4**: Tumor invades the visceral peritoneum or invades or adheres to adjacent organ or structure

### 31.3.4 Prognosis and Treatment

Prognostic Factors and Survival

Colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis is primarily determined by stage at diagnosis, with pathological stage serving as the most important prognostic indicator supported by extensive SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database analysis.

**Stage-Specific 5-Year Survival Rates:**

*Colon Cancer:*

- **Stage I:** 74% overall survival
- **Stage IIA:** 66%
- **Stage IIB:** 58%
- **Stage IIC:** 37%
- **Stage IIIA:** 73%
- **Stage IIIB:** 46%
- **Stage IIIC:** 28%
- **Stage IV:** 5%

*General Patterns:*

- **Localized CRC** (surgically resectable): ~90% 5-year survival
- **Advanced CRC** (lost opportunity for surgical treatment): ~10% 5-year survival
- **Overall combined 5-year survival** for all stages: 65%
- **Metastatic CRC** (stage IV): 5-year survival 10-30% depending on treatment received

**Additional Prognostic Factors:**

*Molecular Markers:*

- **Microsatellite instability (MSI):** MSI-high tumors have better prognosis and enhanced immunotherapy response
- **KRAS/NRAS mutations:** Associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapy
- **BRAF V600E mutation:** Poor prognosis marker (median OS ~12-15 months in metastatic disease without targeted therapy)
- **Tumor sidedness:** Left-sided primary tumors have better prognosis than right-sided
- **Lymphovascular invasion:** Adverse prognostic factor
- **Perineural invasion:** Associated with worse outcomes

*Clinical Factors:*

- Number of lymph nodes examined (≥12 recommended for adequate staging)

### 31.7.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Head and neck cancers represent a diverse group of malignancies arising from the mucosa of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and paranasal sinuses. Tobacco and alcohol use are the primary risk factors, with human papillomavirus (HPV) emerging as an important cause of oropharyngeal cancers.

### 31.7.2 Pathology

Squamous cell carcinoma represents approximately 90% of head and neck cancers. HPV-positive tumors have distinct molecular features and improved prognosis compared to HPV-negative tumors.

### 31.7.3 Treatment

Treatment Principles

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment requires careful balance between oncologic control and functional preservation. Multimodal approaches combining surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are standard for locally advanced disease, with increasing emphasis on organ preservation strategies when feasible.

**Treatment Modalities Overview:**
