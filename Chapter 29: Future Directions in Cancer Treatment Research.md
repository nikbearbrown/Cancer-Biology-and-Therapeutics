# Chapter 29: Future Directions in Cancer Treatment Research

The landscape of cancer research continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, driven by technological advances, deepening understanding of cancer biology, and the urgent need to improve patient outcomes. This chapter explores seven key areas that represent the future of cancer treatment research, each offering unique opportunities to revolutionize how we detect, monitor, and treat cancer.

## 29.1 Liquid Biopsies and Circulating Tumor DNA for Monitoring and Early Detection

### 29.1.1 Foundations and Definition

Liquid biopsy, the sampling of cellular material from a solid tumor that has actively or passively entered the bloodstream, is an exciting area of research in cancer diagnostics. Tumor-derived components amenable to liquid biopsy include circulating tumor cells, exosomes, and circulating nucleic acids such as cell-free DNA and noncoding RNA. The term "cell-free DNA (cfDNA)" refers to fragmented DNA (genetic material) found outside cells in the blood and was first reported by Mandel and Metais in 1948.

**Core Components of Liquid Biopsy:**
- **Circulating tumor cells (CTCs)**: Cells shed from primary and metastatic sites of solid tumors into the bloodstream
- **Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)**: DNA fragments released from tumor cells during apoptosis or necrosis
- **Cell-free RNA (cfRNA)**: RNA molecules circulating in blood plasma
- **Exosomes**: Extracellular vesicles containing genetic material
- **Tumor-educated platelets**: Platelets that have been influenced by tumor cells

### 29.1.2 Technical Approaches and Methodologies

**ctDNA Detection and Analysis:**
Compared to the isolation of circulating tumor cells, isolation of ctDNA is straightforward. Five to twenty milliliters of peripheral blood is drawn in a collection tube containing anticoagulant and preservatives. Cells are removed by centrifugation leaving plasma from which cfDNA can then be extracted using commercially available kits. cfDNA is generally procured from plasma rather than serum, due to the risk of increased non-tumor cfDNA from cell lysis when serum separator tubes are used.

**Technical Challenges:**
Distinguishing ctDNA from non-tumor cfDNA is a major challenge in liquid biopsy research, analogous to the "needle-in-a-haystack" problem of identifying CTCs among blood cells. Success depends on the sensitivity of the method employed for DNA analysis. While traditional RT-PCR has been used to identify point mutations, newer higher sensitivity methods with the potential for absolute quantification include digital PCR in which samples are diluted to one template per PCR reaction.

### 29.1.3 Clinical Applications Across Cancer Types

**Hepatocellular Carcinoma:**
The qualitative and quantitative analysis of these biomarkers holds promise for improving the clinical care of individuals with HCC. In particular, research has focused on the role of liquid biopsy in the detection of HCC at an early and curable stage, given the major clinical need for biomarkers for this purpose. However, commonly used surveillance tools including serum AFP and liver ultrasonography are suboptimal, suffering from low sensitivity for early lesions.

**Uveal Melanoma:**
The detection and characterization of circulating melanoma cells (CMCs) can aid in the diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring of UM patients. Furthermore, CMCs provide additional information that cannot be acquired by studying the primary tumor alone. CMCs can be characterized for the presence of key prognostic factors, such as monosomy-3, and used as a prognostic tool particularly in patients undergoing eye-preserving therapy and where no tumor biopsy is collected.

### 29.1.4 Monitoring Treatment Response and Disease Progression

**Real-time Disease Monitoring:**
For diagnosed early-stage cancer, liquid biopsy could play a role in risk stratification and detection of recurrence after treatment. In the setting of metastatic cancer, liquid biopsy could aid in treatment selection, monitoring of response, and understanding mechanisms of resistance. Each cellular component targeted by liquid biopsy has both strengths and weaknesses in addressing these clinical needs.

**Prognostic Significance:**
Their presence correlates with an unfavorable prognosis and a reduced progression-free interval, and various studies have shown that the monitoring of CTC allows for the evaluation of treatment efficacy in different tumors. It is assumed that the CTCs are predecessors of a metastatic settlement and thus the main element of the metastatic process itself.

### 29.1.5 Current Limitations and Future Directions

**Technical Challenges:**
Despite these potential benefits for cancer care and cancer patients, the implementation of liquid biopsies has a number of considerations and hurdles to overcome, such as the need for further validation, increases in sensitivity and specificity, and the rare nature of cancer mutations. Although liquid biopsy has increasingly been adopted and explored for clinical care, careful analytic and clinical validation, and additional preclinical studies addressing the biology of liquid biopsy analytes are needed.

**Clinical Translation:**
Circulating tumour DNA can be measured across various scales ranging from single mutations to the analysis of the whole genome. Targeting a known tumour mutation has shown to have greater sensitivity (a test that correctly identifies patients with the disease), whereas applying a broader genome approach can be less sensitive. The type of method utilized can present different challenges when attempting to use it for purposes of screening or diagnosis.

## 29.2 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Oncology

### 29.2.1 Historical Context and Current Landscape

**Evolution of AI in Healthcare:**
The field of machine learning applies the scientific method to representing, understanding, and utilizing datasets, and, as a result, practitioners are known as data scientists. Around 2010, AI began its resurgence to prominence due to the success of machine learning and data science techniques as well as significant increases in computational storage and power.

**Growth in Medical Literature:**
Figure 2 illustrates the explosive growth of ML and AI through the number of Pubmed publications over the years between 1990 and 2022. The rate of growth in AI and ML far outpaces the overall growth rate of publications since 2015. In health AI, machine Learning enjoys most of the growth, with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image Analysis following closely.

### 29.2.2 Applications in Cancer Research

**Drug Discovery and Development:**
The big data revolution, accompanied by the development and deployment of wearable medical devices and mobile health applications, has enabled the biomedical community to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to vast amounts of data. This shift has created new research opportunities in predictive analytics, precision medicine, virtual diagnosis, patient monitoring, and drug discovery and delivery.

**Genomic Analysis:**
One noteworthy DARPA project is called Big Mechanism, which is developing an AI system that can read research on cell biology, extract enough information out of it to construct a candidate model of cancer pathways in the cell, interact with a human biologist to try to refine the model, and develop a hypothesis and a causal model of what is happening.

### 29.2.3 Clinical Decision Support Systems

**Diagnostic Applications:**
Many AI technologies can be applied to different aspects of science, such as AI-guided sensors, natural language techniques to process scientific literature, and computer vision for analyzing medical images. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care offers unprecedented opportunities to improve patient and clinical team outcomes, reduce costs, and impact population health.

**Treatment Planning:**
Programming AI and machine learning is still 99 percent human work. The equation for AI success is to take a set of categories (for example, cats and dogs) and an enormous amount of data (that is labeled as to whether it is a cat or a dog), and then feed those two inputs through an algorithm.

### 29.2.4 Challenges and Limitations

**Data Quality and Bias:**
How vulnerable are algorithms to bias and unfairness? How can research improve the process of detecting unfairness in machine learning algorithms? These questions require interdisciplinary discussion and collaboration.

**Validation and Regulatory Considerations:**
Well-constructed ML models do have general applicability beyond the training data, otherwise they would be just a catalogue of past problem instances and their solutions, without the ability to be used for new problem instances. Machine Learning theory provides results and techniques that enable and ideally guarantee the generalization properties of ML models beyond the training data.

### 29.2.5 Future Directions and Integration

**Collaborative AI Systems:**
In time, it would be very important to reach a point where an AI model has developed an understanding of a phenomenon and can explain it to human scientists. There is great potential in AI being used to create and work with digital twins in studying such things as the human body.

**Personalized Medicine:**
AI could play a role in helping scientists do their jobs better—report their findings better, put them in context better, verify them better, and so on. The goal is to create experiences that feel premium and cutting-edge while maintaining scientific rigor.

## 29.3 Organoids and Patient-Derived Xenografts for Drug Testing

### 29.3.1 Patient-Derived Xenograft Models

**Definition and Advantages:**
Patient-derived xenografts (PDX), a recent focus of glioblastoma research, are used extensively in translational research. The PDX model has the advantage of retaining both the genetic and histological features of the primary tumor from which it was derived. Because the tumors are propagated in successive generations of mice, PDX cells are not subjected to stresses that can arise in cell cultures.

**Model Development:**
PDX models are generally established by injecting glioblastoma tumor spheres produced under serum-free neurosphere-culture conditions, into immunodeficient mice. Another method for establishing PDX models is to inject tissues from fresh brain-tumor biopsies into immunodeficient mice. The biopsy tissue is generally minced with surgical blades and placed in flasks containing standard serum-supplemented tissue-culture medium.

### 29.3.2 Advantages of PDX Models Over Traditional Cell Lines

**Genetic Fidelity:**
Patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models are created from direct implantation of either biopsied tumor fragments or freshly isolated cells without the need for intermediate cell culture. These models retain the genetic, histological, and molecular profile similar to the primary tumors, even after multiple cell passages.

**Tumor Microenvironment Preservation:**
Under these conditions, tumor spheroids form quickly, and the spheroids maintain the architecture of the original tissue, including the endothelium, extracellular matrix components, and resident macrophages. PDX models from fresh brain-tumor biopsies display diffuse single-cell infiltration when implanted into the brain of immunodeficient rats or mice.

### 29.3.3 Applications in Drug Development

**Preclinical Testing:**
The value of PDX models in predicting human clinical-trial drug responses was recently highlighted by a study of 1000 PDX cancer models from various primary sites, and by the establishment of a large-scale breast-cancer PDX biobank. This type of large-scale PDX bank is likely to prove valuable for predicting human responses to clinical trials of new glioblastoma drugs, and should help make it possible to tailor therapy to the individual patient.

**Personalized Medicine Applications:**
When a glioblastoma tumor is resected surgically, the tumor cells can be an invaluable source of information that can (and should) be utilized to guide patient treatment (personalized medicine). The tumor cells could potentially be used in a number of platforms, including RNA expression analysis, protein characterization, and metabolic profiling.

### 29.3.4 Technical Considerations and Limitations

**Model Selection:**
There is some controversy as to whether PDX models are best established by injecting freshly biopsied tumor tissue or cultured tumor spheres into mice, and whether orthotopic or subcutaneous xenograft is preferable. While orthotopic xenografts more closely mimic the clinical situation, subcutaneous xenografts are less technically challenging than orthotopic xenografts and are easily passaged in vivo.

**Immunodeficiency Requirements:**
The human tumor cells are transplanted into immunocompromised mice to ensure that the mouse does not reject the human cells. Some common and readily accepted immunocompromised mice are athymic nude mice, severely compromised immunodeficient mice (SCID), or non-obese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice.

### 29.3.5 Organoid Technology

Three-Dimensional Culture Systems: A Paradigm Shift

Organoid technology represents a transformative advancement in cancer modeling, bridging the critical gap between traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Organoids are three-dimensional multicellular clusters that possess the capacity for self-renewal and proliferation while maintaining the physiological structure and function of the tissue from which they are derived. This technology has revolutionized preclinical cancer research by more faithfully recapitulating tumor biology than conventional models.

### Fundamental Advantages of Tumor Organoids

**Preservation of Tumor Characteristics:**

Tumor organoids inherit and maintain the genomic and molecular characteristics of the donor tumor with remarkable fidelity. This includes:

The understanding of the complex relationship between the human microbiota and its host organism has expanded rapidly in recent years, fuelled by high-throughput metagenomic sequencing technologies, advanced bioinformatics analysis methodology, and the development of experimental model systems. Research focusing primarily on the gut microbiota has led to a growing appreciation of its key role in maintaining health, and of dysbiotic gut microbiome states being associated with many common human disorders, including cancer.

**Carcinogenic Mechanisms:**
To date, bacterial mechanisms that promote carcinogenesis are still incompletely elucidated. However, a few bacterial genotoxins and carcinogens are well described, as well as mechanisms by which bacteria reprogramme host signalling towards neoplastic transformation, promote inflammation, or protect against immunosurveillance.

### 29.4.2 Microbiome's Role in Cancer Therapy

The Microbiome-Cancer Therapy Axis

The gut microbiome has emerged as a critical determinant of cancer therapy efficacy and toxicity, fundamentally altering our understanding of treatment responses. Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies demonstrates that the composition and function of the gut microbiota profoundly influence outcomes across multiple therapeutic modalities, including chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy.

### 29.4.3 Clinical Implications for Treatment Response

**Predictive Biomarkers:**
Clinical and preclinical studies have indicated that the composition of the gut microbiota is an important cause of heterogeneous patient response to cancer immunotherapy, among several other factors that determine the cancer immune phenotype. These studies have shown that the composition and diversity of a patient's gut microbiota (assessed before the start of treatment) are predictive of the response to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors.

**Site-Specific Associations:**
Moreover, the microbiota colonizing the pancreas was found to play an important role in regulating the inflammatory tone in the pancreatic tumour microenvironment in mice via pattern recognition receptor signalling. However, larger clinical studies are needed to validate individual microbial taxa enriched in pancreatic tissue or in the mouth and the gut of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

**Current Challenges:**

### 29.4.4 Therapeutic Microbiome Modulation

**Probiotic Interventions:**
The accumulating evidence that gut microbes affect cancer therapy has reinforced interest in microbiome modulations that aim to improve response rates. Along these lines, preclinical studies have found beneficial effects of probiotics (oral administration of defined live bacterial strains) on progression-free survival in mice when administered alone or in combination with immunotherapy.

**Regulatory Challenges:**
However, current regulations impede the rapid clinical translation of these findings; strict regulation of probiotics as combination therapies with immunotherapeutic treatment modalities necessitates extensive clinical trials. An attractive alternative may be to instead focus on prebiotics (dietary compounds that stimulate the growth of certain gut microbial clades) or diets that are rationally designed to modulate the gut microbiome.

### 29.4.5 Therapeutic Microbes as Cancer Treatment

Historical Foundation and Modern Renaissance

The use of microbes, particularly bacteria, as anticancer agents has a rich historical foundation dating back to the late 19th century. Dr. William Coley, often regarded as the "father of cancer immunotherapy," observed tumor regression in cancer patients following injections of live Streptococcus pyogenes. His development of "Coley's toxin"—heat-inactivated Streptococcus and Serratia marcescens administered intratumorally—led to partial or complete cancer regression in many refractory patients. Although this approach was largely abandoned with the advent of standardized chemotherapy and radiotherapy, recent advancements in genetic engineering and synthetic biology have reignited interest in bacterial therapeutics.

Another successful historical example is Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, derived from an attenuated variant of Mycobacterium bovis, which received FDA approval in 1990 for bladder cancer treatment and remains a standard therapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

## 29.5 Metabolic Targeting Beyond the Warburg Effect

### 29.5.1 Evolution from the Classical Warburg Effect

**Historical Foundation:**
Otto Warburg observed a peculiar phenomenon in 1924, unknowingly laying the foundation for the field of cancer metabolism. While his contemporaries hypothesized that tumor cells derived the energy required for uncontrolled replication from proteolysis and lipolysis, Warburg instead found them to rapidly consume glucose and produce lactate even in the presence of oxygen.

**Beyond Simple Glycolysis:**
Tumor cells exhibit an upregulation in glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and gluconeogenesis as opposed to normal cells. Several oncogenes and tumor suppressors drive the metabolic reprogramming underlying the Warburg effect and other changes in glucose metabolism. There is heterogeneity in glucose metabolism across tumor types as well as within the tumor microenvironment.

### 29.5.2 Metabolic Heterogeneity and Tumor Microenvironment

**Intratumoral Diversity:**
These phenotypes offer cancerous cells one of the most valued assets in their battle for survival: their metabolic diversity, which can explain why it is so difficult to find effective therapies for most cancers. Tumors have different genetic and metabolic phenotypes due to different environmental pressures such as vascularization, oxygen supply, and other factors such as drug treatments.

**Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Interactions:**
Within the TME of solid tumors, heterogeneous cancer cells and CAFs interact by transferring their metabolites, including amino acids, fatty acids, ketone bodies, cytokines, and growth factors, which reciprocally facilitate the growth of cancer cells. Moreover, CAFs provide not only a structural matrix for providing a tumor-friendly microenvironment to cancer cells but also nutrients for cancer cells.

### 29.5.3 Novel Metabolic Targets

The Glutamine Addiction Paradigm

Beyond the classical Warburg effect, cancer cells exhibit profound dependence on glutamine metabolism, a phenomenon termed "glutamine addiction." Harry Eagle first demonstrated in the 1950s that HeLa cervical cancer cells require 10-100 times more glutamine than other amino acids to maintain growth. This observation has been validated across numerous cancer types including pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, small cell lung cancer, and many others.

**Central Role of Glutamine in Cancer Biology:**

Glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in blood plasma at approximately 500 μM concentration, plays unique and multifaceted roles in proliferating cancer cells:

*Nitrogen Donor Functions:*

- Nitrogen source for synthesis of non-essential amino acids including alanine, aspartate, proline, and ornithine
- Essential for protein biosynthesis
- Required for synthesis of amino sugars and NAD cofactors

*Carbon Source Functions:*

- Glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) replenishes the TCA cycle (anaplerosis)
- Provides carbon for lipid biosynthesis through reductive carboxylation when glucose-derived citrate is insufficient
- Critical in hypoxic conditions or mitochondrial dysfunction where glutamine directly provides carbons for fatty acid and citrate synthesis
- Supports energy production through oxidative metabolism

*Redox Homeostasis:*

- Precursor for glutathione biosynthesis (major cellular antioxidant)

## 29.6 Novel Combinatorial Approaches

### 29.6.1 Rationale for Combination Therapy

**Tumor Heterogeneity:**
The most compelling rationale for combination chemotherapy, is (1) tumor cell heterogeneity and its implication for drug resistance, and (2) the success of combination chemotherapy in the clinic. There is ample clinical precedent for using multiple agents. Essentially all curative chemotherapy involves combinations of 2 and usually 3 or more agents.

**Overcoming Resistance:**
While tumors are clonal in origin, the increasing DNA instability that accompanies the onset of neoplasia leads to increased variation of daughter cells, referred to as clonal evolution to tumor cell heterogeneity. This is associated with selection for progeny with greater survival capacity, evident as a higher proliferative capacity, resistance to apoptosis, greater metastatic or invasive potential.

### 29.6.2 Mechanisms of Drug Resistance

**Bypass Pathways:**
One type is due to a mutation or genetic event affecting the target of the drug itself so that the kinase is still able to drive the growth of the tumor, despite the continued presence of the drug. Another type of resistance occurs when the cancer uses pathways that bypass the blocked kinase. These bypasses activate the same key downstream tumor growth-promoting signaling pathways.

**Rebound Activation:**
When researchers perturb one signaling pathway with a kinase inhibitor, it often causes rebound activation of these bypass backup pathways such that the effectiveness of the inhibitor is muted. Consequently, combination treatments are needed that target both the kinase and the bypass pathways.

### 29.6.3 Immunotherapy Combinations

Rationale for Immunotherapy Combinations

While single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment, response rates typically range from 15-40% depending on tumor type, with many patients showing primary resistance or developing acquired resistance. The induction, potency, and persistence of host anti-tumor responses reflect complex interplay of diverse immune cells with progressing tumors. Monotherapies are unlikely to address the major mechanisms impeding anti-tumor immune responses in all patients, as effective anti-tumor reactions require successful execution of multiple immune processes simultaneously. This fundamental limitation has driven extensive research into combination immunotherapy strategies.

### Dual Checkpoint Inhibitor Combinations

**CTLA-4 Plus PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade:**

The combination of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) represents the most extensively studied dual checkpoint inhibitor approach:

### 29.7.1 Mechanisms of Treatment Resistance

**Primary and Acquired Resistance:**
In general, systemic agents are active at the beginning of therapy in 90% of primary breast cancers and 50% of metastases. However, after a variable period of time, progression occurs. At this point, resistance to therapy is not only common, it is expected. Treatment resistance is most commonly seen in such patients. They initially may have a response to different agents, but the responses are not sustained.

**Genetic Evolution:**
Thus far, MM remains an incurable disease, with a significant number of patients relapsing due to evolving genetic mutations in tumor cells resulting in treatment resistance. The etiology of RRMM is not well understood. Identifying risk factors enables clinicians to implement targeted intervention strategies and preventive measures.

### 29.7.2 Patterns of Relapse

**Disease Recurrence:**
Despite advances in early detection and understanding of the molecular bases of breast cancer biology, approximately 30% of all patients with early-stage breast cancer have recurrent disease, which is metastatic in most cases. The rates of local and systemic recurrence vary within different series, but in general, distant recurrences are dominant.

**Time to Progression:**
Patients who experience a relapse after remission usually die within 1 year, even if a second complete remission is achieved. Most patients with MM will respond well to the first line of therapy, but most will relapse as conventional treatment is not curative.

### 29.7.3 Strategies to Overcome Resistance

Comprehensive Resistance Management Framework

Overcoming treatment resistance requires multifaceted strategies that address the diverse mechanisms by which cancer cells evade therapy. Modern approaches integrate molecular profiling, rational drug combinations, adaptive treatment protocols, and emerging technologies to combat and prevent resistance.

### Combination Therapy Strategies

**Simultaneous Multi-Target Inhibition:**

*Rationale:*

- Cancer cells employ multiple resistance mechanisms simultaneously
- Targeting single nodes in signaling pathways allows bypass pathway activation
- Combination therapies block multiple escape routes concurrently
- Synergistic or additive effects exceed single-agent efficacy

*Vertical Pathway Targeting:*

- Inhibiting multiple nodes within same pathway (e.g., BRAF + MEK in melanoma)
- Achieves more complete pathway suppression
- Prevents pathway reactivation through upstream/downstream compensation
- Clinical validation in BRAF-mutant melanoma with dabrafenib + trametinib combination

*Horizontal Multi-Pathway Targeting:*

- Simultaneous inhibition of parallel survival pathways
- Example: MAPK pathway + PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition
- Prevents compensatory pathway activation
- Broader suppression of oncogenic signaling

*Combination Examples:*

- **BCR-ABL+ Leukemia:** ATP-competitive inhibitors + allosteric ABL kinase inhibitors overcoming T315I resistance mutation in preclinical studies
- **BRAF-mutant Colorectal Cancer:** Dual BRAF/EGFR inhibition or triple BRAF/EGFR/MEK or BRAF/EGFR/PI3K combinations (clinical trials NCT01719380, NCT01750918, NCT01791309)
- **Prostate Cancer:** Androgen deprivation therapy + abiraterone suppressing AR signaling more potently than ADT alone

**Targeting Resistance Mechanisms Directly:**

- Exploits differential sensitivities at different disease states
- May reduce cumulative toxicity compared to simultaneous combinations
- Allows dose intensity of individual agents

*Clinical Examples:*

- Endocrine therapy sequences in breast cancer (tamoxifen → aromatase inhibitors → fulvestrant)
- EGFR inhibitor generations in NSCLC (gefitinib/erlotinib → osimertinib for T790M+ resistance)
- BCR-ABL inhibitor sequences in CML (imatinib → dasatinib/nilotinib → ponatinib for resistant mutations)

**Drug Holidays and Intermittent Dosing:**

*Rationale:*

*Clinical Trial Evidence:*

**Ovarian Cancer Studies:**

- OVCAR-3 cells in SCID mice treated with carboplatin
- Adaptive dosing based on tumor volume response
- Standard therapy: 180 mg/kg total carboplatin → tumor recurrence and death
- Adaptive therapy groups: 320 and 310 mg/kg total → maintained tumor stability
- Drug amount needed for control decreased substantially over time
- Final control achieved with 10 mg/kg doses

**Breast Cancer Studies:**

- Endocrine-resistant MCF7 model simulating second-line therapy
- Capecitabine and/or gemcitabine adaptive protocols
- Dose modulation with alternating drugs significantly increased survival vs MTD (HR=0.07, p=0.003)
- Reduced-dose protocols showed increased survival for both single (p<0.01) and combined drugs (p<0.001)
- Tumors had fewer proliferating cells and more apoptotic cells than high-dose therapy
- Adaptive therapy favoring slower-growing tumors

*Key Findings:*

- Two-drug alternating regimens superior to simultaneous combination

### 29.7.4 Prevention of Relapse

**Maintenance Therapy:**
Relapse has become the most frequent cause of treatment failure after HSCT. Because outcome after relapse remains poor, major effect is focused on prevention of relapse.
