# Chapter 18: Cancer Detection and Diagnosis

The accurate detection and diagnosis of cancer represents one of the most critical aspects of oncologic care, directly influencing treatment decisions, patient outcomes, and survival rates. This chapter examines the comprehensive array of diagnostic approaches available to clinicians, from traditional imaging techniques to cutting-edge molecular diagnostics. Understanding these methodologies and their appropriate applications is essential for medical and nursing professionals involved in cancer care.

## 18.1 Screening Methods

Cancer screening serves as the foundation for early detection, identifying malignancies before clinical symptoms develop. Early diagnosis, during the first stages of cancer development, leads to a precocious therapeutic strategy, with chances of recovery or prolongation of the patient's life expectancy.

### 18.1.1 Principles of Cancer Screening

**Definition and Purpose:**
Screening refers to the systematic examination of asymptomatic individuals to detect early signs of cancer. The fundamental premise underlying cancer screening is that earlier detection enables more effective treatment and improved outcomes.

**Characteristics of Effective Screening Programs:**
- **Population-based approach:** Systematic application to defined populations at risk
- **High sensitivity:** Ability to detect disease when present
- **High specificity:** Minimization of false-positive results
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Benefits must outweigh costs and potential harms
- **Accessibility:** Tests must be feasible for widespread implementation

### 18.1.2 Established Screening Modalities

#### Mammographic Screening

Mammography is the mainstay of breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Mammography, together with ultrasound and MRI, is used for the detection and staging of breast cancer and helps guide treatment decisions.

**Technical Advances:**
- **Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT):** DBT is a three-dimensional (3D) imaging method with the potential to overcome the main limitation of standard two-dimensional mammography, a masking effect due to overlapping fibroglandular breast tissue, improving diagnostic accuracy in breast cancer, particularly in dense breasts.
- **Contrast-Enhanced Mammography (CEM):** CEM allows both a morphologic evaluation comparable to routine digital mammography and through contrast agent application a simultaneous assessment of tumor neovascularity as an indicator of malignancy similar to MRI.

**Performance Metrics:**
- The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) was developed by the American College of Radiology in order to standardize terminology describing mammographic findings.
- Acceptable performance metrics include a cancer detection rate of ≥2.5 cancers/1000 screens and a recall rate between 5 and 12%
- Randomized controlled trials have found that screening mammography has decreased the mortality for breast cancer by 30%

#### Cervical Cancer Screening

Cervical cancer screening represents one of the most successful cancer control programs, demonstrating dramatic reductions in incidence and mortality through systematic implementation.

**Screening Technologies:**
- **Papanicolaou (Pap) cytology:** Traditional method examining cellular morphology
- **Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing:** Detection of high-risk HPV types

- **Abdominal evaluation:** Assessment of liver, kidney, and pelvic malignancies
- **Thyroid nodule evaluation:** Characterization and biopsy guidance
- **Lymph node assessment:** Evaluation of nodal involvement

## 18.3 Biopsy and Pathology: Histology, Cytology

Tissue diagnosis remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, providing definitive pathological confirmation and essential information for treatment planning.

### 18.3.1 Principles of Cancer Pathology

**Fundamental Role:**
Surgical pathologists have the definitive role in tumor diagnosis. No matter how high the index of clinical suspicion, the diagnosis of cancer is not conclusively established nor safely assumed in the absence of a tissue diagnosis. With very few exceptions, definitive therapy for cancer should not be undertaken in the absence of a tissue diagnosis.

**Pathologist Responsibilities:**
Pathologists are physicians who are concerned primarily with the study of disease in all its aspects; that is, causation, diagnosis, pathogenesis, mechanisms, natural history, anatomic and biochemical features, progression, and prognosis.

### 18.3.2 Biopsy Techniques

#### Incisional Biopsy

**Indications:**
Incisional biopsy (along with fine-needle aspiration) is often the method of choice for lesions that are inoperable, too large for ready excision, or when excision could lead to functional or cosmetic impairment.

**Technical Considerations:**
- An incisional biopsy is recommended when a malignant diagnosis is suspected, as further surgical intervention is usually required.
- A wedge-shaped biopsy to capture some normal and abnormal tissue may be preferred to facilitate histopathological examination.
- When a more aggressive lesion is suspected, photographs of the lesion in situ and the specimens should be taken.

#### Excisional Biopsy

**Advantages:**
Excisional biopsy is often favored because it provides generous amounts of tissue for diagnosis and may itself afford sufficient surgical therapy for some tumors, for example, small- to medium-sized breast cancers.

**Clinical Applications:**
- Complete removal of small, accessible lesions
- Diagnostic and potentially therapeutic procedure
- Optimal tissue preservation for histopathological analysis

#### Image-Guided Biopsy

**Technical Approaches:**
- **CT-guided biopsy:** Precise targeting of deep-seated lesions
- **Ultrasound-guided biopsy:** Real-time visualization and guidance
- **MRI-guided biopsy:** Superior soft tissue contrast for targeting
- **Stereotactic biopsy:** Precise localization using coordinate systems

**Specimen Considerations:**
The reliability of biomarker test results depends on the quality of the patient specimens. If the specimen is inadequate for tests that need to be conducted, repeat biopsy procedures may be required to obtain samples sufficient for testing, exposing the patient to unnecessary risk.

### 18.3.3 Cytological Diagnosis

**Advantages of Cytology:**
In both tumor processes and other pathological situations... cytologic examination has the advantage of a microscopic preparation consistent with the tissue of origin, without the changes that occur in histological sections by fixation and processing. In addition, rapid, even intraoperative diagnosis, is possible in the case of neoplasms.

**Cytological Sampling Methods:**
- **Fine needle aspiration (FNA):** Minimally invasive sampling of palpable or image-guided lesions
- **Exfoliative cytology:** Collection of naturally shed cells (e.g., Pap smears)
- **Body fluid analysis:** Examination of pleural, peritoneal, or cerebrospinal fluid
- **Brush cytology:** Sampling of mucosal surfaces through endoscopy

**Limitations:**
Although compared to the histological section, the cytological preparation has some limits regarding the complexity of a tissue, with relationships between cells and/or support tissue, vascularization and a general complex image, cytodiagnosis is, at least for oncology, an extremely useful method.

### 18.3.4 Histopathological Analysis

#### Tissue Processing and Staining

**Standard Procedures:**
- **Fixation:** Preservation of tissue architecture and cellular morphology
- **Embedding:** Paraffin processing for sectioning
- **Sectioning:** Creation of thin tissue sections for microscopic examination
- **Staining:** Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and specialized stains

#### Immunohistochemistry

**Principles:**
Immunohistochemistry utilizes specific antibodies to identify cellular proteins, providing essential information for cancer classification and treatment planning.

**Clinical Applications:**
- **Cancer subtyping:** Differentiation of morphologically similar tumors
- **Prognostic markers:** Assessment of tumor behavior and patient outcomes
- **Predictive markers:** Selection of targeted therapies
- **Metastatic workup:** Identification of primary tumor site

#### Special Stains and Techniques

**Histochemical Stains:**
- **Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS):** Detection of glycogen and mucins
- **Reticulin stains:** Assessment of architectural preservation
- **Trichrome stains:** Evaluation of connective tissue components

**Molecular Pathology Techniques:**
- **In situ hybridization:** Detection of specific nucleic acid sequences
- **Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH):** Chromosomal abnormality assessment
- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR):** Amplification of specific genetic sequences

## 18.4 Molecular Diagnostics: Biomarkers, Liquid Biopsy

The integration of molecular diagnostics into cancer care has revolutionized our understanding of tumor biology and enabled the development of precision medicine approaches.

### 18.4.1 Cancer Biomarkers

**Definition and Classification:**
Biomarkers come in many forms and can include genetic sequencing information, such as the increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer in individuals with BRCA1 mutations; analysis of nanometer-scale extracellular vesicles from the urine, such as prostate cancer prediction through sequencing of exosomes; and aberrant overexpression of proteins.

**Categories of Biomarkers:**
- **Diagnostic biomarkers:** Assist in cancer detection and classification
- **Prognostic biomarkers:** Provide information about disease course and outcomes
- **Predictive biomarkers:** Guide selection of targeted therapies
- **Pharmacodynamic biomarkers:** Monitor treatment response and drug effects

### 18.4.2 Molecular Testing Technologies

#### Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)

**Technical Capabilities:**
NGS enables comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors, identifying mutations, copy number alterations, and structural rearrangements across multiple genes simultaneously.

**Clinical Applications:**
A molecular biology revolution that has changed the way in which cancer is diagnosed and treated began in earnest in the 1990s and early 2000s when several molecularly targeted therapies became available. Biomarker tests were used to assess the likelihood of responding to specific treatments targeted to the genetic alterations in the tumors that drive their growth.

**Advantages over Single-Gene Testing:**
- **Comprehensive profiling:** Simultaneous analysis of multiple cancer-related genes
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Reduced per-gene testing costs
- **Tissue conservation:** Maximum information from limited specimens
- **Novel discovery:** Identification of unexpected therapeutic targets

#### RNA Sequencing

**Emerging Applications:**
Hayes said it is also less expensive and easier to find repeated or deleted sequences and other structural alterations to the genome with RNA versus DNA sequencing. This technology could be helpful in detecting genetic alterations in the many patients for which DNA analysis has not revealed mutations that are driving their cancers.

**Clinical Utility:**
- **Gene expression profiling:** Assessment of tumor biology and behavior
- **Fusion gene detection:** Identification of chromosomal rearrangements
- **Immune profiling:** Evaluation of tumor microenvironment
- **Splice variant analysis:** Detection of alternative transcript forms

### 18.4.3 Liquid Biopsy Technologies

**Conceptual Framework:**
Solid tumors release a variety of cellular components into the bloodstream that can be sampled by liquid biopsy. These blood-borne biomarkers include circulating tumor cells, exosomes, cell-free DNA, and cell-free noncoding RNA.

#### Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA)

**Technical Principles:**
Other innovative biomarker tests on the horizon are those that measure tumor DNA circulating in the blood. Called liquid biopsies, these tests analyze a small blood sample to detect and screen the naked DNA released by tumor cells during cell turnover.

**Clinical Applications:**
- **Minimal residual disease detection:** Monitoring for microscopic disease persistence
- **Treatment response assessment:** Real-time evaluation of therapeutic efficacy
- **Resistance monitoring:** Early detection of acquired resistance mutations
- **Disease surveillance:** Non-invasive monitoring for recurrence

**Advantages:**
- The concept of sampling a tumor through phlebotomy is inherently attractive due to the risks of sampling the primary tumor which... include tumor seeding along the biopsy tract, hemoperitoneum, pneumothorax, bile peritonitis and sampling error leading to false negative results.
- Real-time assessment without invasive procedures
- Ability to monitor tumor evolution over time
- Capture of tumor heterogeneity through systemic sampling

#### Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs)

**Biological Significance:**
Analysis at the cellular level can be performed by measuring the quantity of CTCs in a blood sample that enter the circulation via passive shedding of the tumour. CTCs can originate from either the primary tumour or from a metastatic site, making them potentially useful biomarkers of cancer to aid in early detection, staging, monitoring, and prognosis of cancer.

**Technical Challenges:**
- **Rarity:** CTCs are extremely rare in peripheral blood
- **Heterogeneity:** Variable characteristics among circulating cells
- **Capture efficiency:** Technical limitations in isolation methods
- **Standardization:** Lack of consensus on optimal detection methods

#### Extracellular Vesicles

**Emerging Research:**
Given their mechanistic role in carcinogenesis, their multimolecular contents, and their stability, EVs have an exciting future in liquid biopsy; however, little is known about their role in HCC specifically at this time.

**Potential Applications:**
- **Protein biomarker delivery:** Stable transport of tumor-derived proteins
- **RNA cargo analysis:** microRNA and mRNA profiling
- **Immune modulation markers:** Assessment of tumor-immune interactions
- **Drug resistance mechanisms:** Understanding of therapeutic failure

### 18.4.4 Companion Diagnostics

**Regulatory Framework:**
The approval was somewhat different from the other diagnostic tests, because it is a companion diagnostic (CDx) used to predict and inform therapy decisions. This is the first time there has been an FDA approval of a test that also considers what therapeutic drug can be used based on the patient's test results.

**Clinical Implementation:**
- **Treatment selection:** Identification of patients likely to benefit from specific therapies
- **Dose optimization:** Guidance for personalized dosing strategies
- **Safety monitoring:** Prediction of adverse drug reactions
- **Resistance detection:** Monitoring for treatment failure mechanisms

### 18.4.5 Challenges in Molecular Diagnostics

#### Specimen Requirements

**Quality Considerations:**
All clinically relevant tissue-based biomarkers use FFPE tissue retrieved from a surgical specimen or biopsy as starting material. Fresh frozen tissue is known to be superior for extracting nucleic acids and downstream molecular analysis, but there are practical hurdles in relying on the latter for routine clinical use.

**Standardization Needs:**
- **Pre-analytical variables:** Specimen collection, handling, and storage protocols
- **Quality control:** Assessment of DNA/RNA integrity and quantity
- **Documentation requirements:** Comprehensive tracking of specimen characteristics
- **Turnaround times:** Balancing accuracy with clinical urgency

#### Interpretation Challenges

**Complex Results:**
The rapidly changing nature of the technologies used to develop tests adds to the complexity of assessing new tests as they arise.

**Clinical Integration:**
- **Multidisciplinary interpretation:** Collaboration between pathologists, oncologists, and molecular biologists
- **Incidental findings:** Management of unexpected genetic discoveries
- **Variant classification:** Distinction between pathogenic and benign alterations
- **Therapeutic implications:** Translation of molecular findings into treatment decisions

## 18.5 Cancer Staging and Grading

Accurate staging and grading of cancer are fundamental to treatment planning, prognostic assessment, and clinical trial design, providing a standardized framework for describing tumor characteristics and extent of disease.

### 18.5.1 Cancer Staging Systems

#### TNM Classification System

**Fundamental Principles:**
The TNM Classification is a system for classifying a malignancy. It is primarily used in solid tumors and can assist in prognostic cancer staging. A standard classification system improves provider communication and facilitates information sharing and research across populations.

**TNM Components:**
- **T (Tumor):** Used to describe the size of the primary tumor and its invasion into adjacent tissues. T0 indicates no evidence of tumor is present, while T1-T4 is used to identify the size and extension of the tumor, with progressive enlargement and invasiveness from T1 to T4.
- **N (Nodes):** Describes whether or not regional lymph nodes are affected... indicating whether or not the tumor has spread into nearby (regional) lymph nodes.
- **M (Metastases):** Describes whether or not distant metastases have been found... telling us whether or not the tumor has spread to other parts of the body, forming what is known as distant metastases.

**Stage Grouping:**
The TNM system helps to establish the anatomic extent of the disease, and the combination of the 3 factors can define the overall tumor stage. This method allows for simplification, with cancers staged from I-IV, with stage IV being the most severe stage.

- **Stage 0:** Indicates carcinoma in situ
- **Stage I:** Early-stage localized cancer
- **Stage II-III:** Regional extension and nodal involvement
- **Stage IV:** Distant metastatic disease

#### Advantages of TNM System

**Standardization Benefits:**
The TNM classification devised by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) and accepted by the American Joint Commission on Cancer Staging is a world standard. The UICC-TNM system is prepared so that results can be interpreted universally.

**Clinical Applications:**
The purposes of staging are to (a) plan a therapeutic strategy that is most appropriate for the patient, (b) allow for more intelligent prognostication of the disease status of the patient, and (c) permit comparison of therapeutic results obtained from different sources by different means.

### 18.5.2 Cancer Grading Systems

#### Histologic Grade

**Fundamental Concepts:**
Cancer grading describes the microscopic appearance of the tumor's cells and tissue. Low-grade tumors have relatively normal-appearing cells and tissue structures. These tumors are considered well-differentiated. Higher-grade tumors have more abnormal-appearing cells and tissue that is structured abnormally.

**Grading Classifications:**
In many cases, the less differentiated tumor cells are, the faster they grow and the earlier they spread to surrounding tissue. Tumors are graded using the abbreviations G1 to G4: the higher the grade, the less differentiated and the more malignant the tumor is.

- **G1 (Well-differentiated):** Cells closely resemble normal tissue
- **G2 (Moderately differentiated):** Cells show moderate abnormalities
- **G3 (Poorly differentiated):** Cells are highly abnormal
- **G4 (Undifferentiated):** Cells bear little resemblance to normal tissue

#### Organ-Specific Grading Systems

**Gleason Score (Prostate Cancer):**
Prostate biopsies aim to confirm the diagnosis and assess the histological architecture using the Gleason scoring system, which evaluates glandular architectural patterns.

**Nottingham Grade (Breast Cancer):**
- **Tubule formation:** Assessment of glandular differentiation
- **Nuclear pleomorphism:** Evaluation of nuclear characteristics
- **Mitotic count:** Quantification of cell division activity

### 18.5.3 Molecular Classification Systems

#### Integration with Traditional Systems

**Evolving Paradigms:**
Cancer taxonomy is expected to become molecular-based; however, it is likely that tumor classification is going to be based on a combination of tumor location and molecular diagnosis.

**Examples of Molecular Classification:**
- **Breast cancer:** Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, Triple-negative subtypes
- **Lung adenocarcinoma:** EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS molecular subtypes
- **Colorectal cancer:** Microsatellite stable vs. unstable, BRAF/KRAS status
- **Endometrial cancer:** POLEmut, MMRd, NSMP, and p53abn subtypes

#### Clinical Implementation

**Prognostic Significance:**
The revised FIGO staging system markedly clarified tumor characteristics for each stage and incorporated molecular analysis data from the Cancer Genome Atlas, which are correlated with prognosis and treatment planning.

**Treatment Implications:**
- **Targeted therapy selection:** Matching molecular profiles to specific drugs
- **Immunotherapy candidates:** Identification of patients likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors
- **Risk stratification:** Enhanced prognostic accuracy beyond anatomical staging
- **Clinical trial enrollment:** Molecular criteria for research participation

### 18.5.4 Prognostic and Predictive Factors

#### Prognostic Factors

**Definition and Importance:**
The single most important determinant of prognosis for a patient with renal cell carcinoma is the pathologic stage when the tumor is initially diagnosed and treated.

**Common Prognostic Factors:**
- **Tumor size:** Correlation with metastatic potential
- **Lymph node involvement:** Indicator of regional spread
- **Histologic grade:** Degree of cellular differentiation
- **Vascular invasion:** Predictor of metastatic risk
- **Performance status:** Patient's functional capacity

#### Predictive Factors

**Therapeutic Decision-Making:**
Predictive factors help identify patients most likely to benefit from specific treatments, enabling personalized therapeutic approaches.

**Examples of Predictive Biomarkers:**
- **HER2 overexpression:** Predicts response to trastuzumab in breast cancer
- **EGFR mutations:** Predicts response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer
- **PD-L1 expression:** Predicts response to immune checkpoint inhibitors
- **Microsatellite instability:** Predicts response to immunotherapy across tumor types

### 18.5.5 Future Directions in Cancer Classification

#### Precision Medicine Integration

**Comprehensive Molecular Profiling:**
Looking to the future, one projection is that tumor sequencing will become standard clinical practice in the next few years, and the question is when should this tumor sequencing occur? Should it occur right after initial diagnosis? Should it occur after patients have received initial therapy and then develop refractory disease?

**Artificial Intelligence Applications:**
- **Pattern recognition:** Machine learning approaches to histopathologic diagnosis
- **Risk stratification:** AI-enhanced prognostic modeling
- **Treatment prediction:** Algorithmic approaches to therapy selection
- **Quality assurance:** Automated validation of diagnostic accuracy

#### Liquid Biopsy Integration

**Dynamic Staging:**
If the patient, for example, has had mutations detected in their tumor with next-generation gene sequencing, the physician can sample circulating tumor DNA during and after treatment to follow these mutations and other molecular changes over time—and do so without performing invasive tumor biopsies.

**Real-time Monitoring:**
- **Treatment response:** Continuous assessment of therapeutic efficacy
- **Resistance detection:** Early identification of treatment failure
- **Disease progression:** Non-invasive monitoring of metastatic spread
- **Recurrence surveillance:** Long-term follow-up for disease relapse
