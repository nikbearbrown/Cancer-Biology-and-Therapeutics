The genetics and genomic instability underlying cancer represent a complex interplay of normal cellular processes gone awry. The ability of cells to maintain a high degree of order in a chaotic universe depends upon the accurate duplication of vast quantities of genetic information carried in chemical form as DNA. Maintaining order also requires the continued surveillance and repair of this genetic information because DNA inside cells is repeatedly damaged by chemicals and radiation from the environment, as well as by thermal accidents and reactive molecules.

Understanding these fundamental processes—DNA replication, mutation, chromosomal aberrations, DNA repair, and genomic instability—provides the foundation for comprehending cancer biology and developing targeted therapeutic approaches. While the short-term survival of a cell can depend on preventing changes in its DNA, the long-term survival of a species requires that DNA sequences be changeable. In cancer, this balance is disrupted, leading to the progressive accumulation of genetic alterations that drive malignant transformation and tumor progression.

The evidence from authoritative medical literature demonstrates that cancer fundamentally represents a genetic disease, where the normal fidelity of DNA replication and repair systems becomes compromised, allowing the accumulation of mutations that ultimately transform normal cells into malignant ones. This understanding continues to inform the development of precision medicine approaches that target the specific genetic alterations driving each patient's cancer.
