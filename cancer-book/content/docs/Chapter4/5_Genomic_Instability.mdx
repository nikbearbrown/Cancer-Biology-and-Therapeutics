title: 4.5 Genomic Instability
---

From an evolutionary perspective this is not a surprise: one might expect that genetic instability would promote the formation of cancer, as it increases the probability that cells will experience a mutation that will lead toward malignancy. In fact, it seems that some degree of genetic instability may be essential for the development of cancer; at the very least it appears to make a powerful contribution to cancer progression.

## 4.5.1 Cancer as an Evolutionary Process

The body of an animal operates as a society or ecosystem whose individual members are cells, reproducing by cell division and organized into collaborative assemblies or tissues. The one ecological topic conspicuously absent was that of natural selection: we said nothing of competition or mutation among somatic cells. The reason is that a healthy body is in this respect a very peculiar society, where self-sacrifice—as opposed to survival of the fittest—is the rule.

**Evidence for Somatic Evolution**

First, cells of a variety of cancers can be shown to have a shared abnormality in their DNA sequence that distinguishes them from the normal cells surrounding the tumor. Second, many of the agents known to give rise to cancer also cause genetic changes. Thus carcinogenesis (the generation of cancer) appears to be linked with mutagenesis (the production of a change in the DNA sequence).

## 4.5.2 Types of Genomic Instability

**Chromosomal Instability**

Some have argued that mutations causing chromosomal instability likely arise early in progression in many tumors. Such chromosomal instability could explain the accumulation of numerous genetic changes in a cell lineage, ultimately leading to malignant disease.

**Microsatellite Instability**

In patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, or HNPCC, the cancer cells in the tumors that develop are unusual, examination of their chromosomes reveals a normal (or almost normal) karyotype. In contrast, the vast majority of colorectal tumors in non-HNPCC patients have gross chromosomal abnormalities, with multiple translocations, deletions, and other aberrations, and a total of 55 to 70 or more chromosomes instead of the normal 46.

## 4.5.3 Mechanisms Driving Genomic Instability

**p53 Loss and Chromosomal Instability**

The loss of p53 activity can be trebly dangerous in relation to cancer. First, it allows faulty mutant cells to continue through the cell cycle. Second, it allows them to escape apoptosis. Third, it leads to the genetic instability characteristic of cancer cells, allowing further cancer-promoting mutations to accumulate as they divide.

**Telomere Dysfunction**

An important part of the answer may lie in the behavior of telomeres and the relationship between telomere shortening, replicative cell senescence, and genetic instability. Most human cells seem to have a built-in limit to their proliferation: they show replicative senescence. Replicative cell senescence in humans is thought to be caused by changes in the structure of telomeres—the repetitive DNA sequences and associated proteins that cap the ends of each chromosome.

## 4.5.4 Genomic Landscape of Cancer

The development of a cancer represents a new, distinct cell population characterized by a range of genetic events, some of which drive the cancer. Landscape analyses of events across entire cancer genomes have revealed a wide range of types of somatic genetic events (from single base mutations to the shattering of entire chromosomes), many involving driver genes, and even more mutations that appear to be passengers.

**Driver vs Passenger Mutations**

Some mutations inactivate genes that protect the cell from abnormal growth, known as tumour suppressor genes, whereas other mutations activate genes that accelerate abnormal growth, known as oncogenes. Characterization of cancer genomes has revealed that the origins of cancer are complex. The list of recurrently mutated cancer genes is relatively short, but there are many rarely mutated genes.

## 4.5.5 Clinical Implications of Genomic Instability

**Cancer Progression**

Two process may accelerate the accumulation of genomic change. First, changes early in progression may accelerate the production of subsequent changes. Second, competition and selection between cell lineages that harbor various genomic changes would favor clonal expansion of more aggressive lines.

**Therapeutic Considerations**

In addition to the leukemogenic effect, evidence suggests that BCR/ABL1 oncogene independently leads to genomic instability. Studies have shown that primary or acquired resistance to treatment as well as relapse, can be attributed to different mutations. Rearrangements in the BCR gene can help in the prediction of response to therapy.
