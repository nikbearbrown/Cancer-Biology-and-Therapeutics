title: 4.2 Mutations - Types and Consequences
---




A mutation is a change in the nucleotide sequence of a short region of a genome. Many mutations are point mutations that replace one nucleotide with another; others involve insertion or deletion of one or a few nucleotides. Mutations result either from errors in DNA replication or from the damaging effects of mutagens, such as chemicals and radiation, which react with DNA and change the structures of individual nucleotides.

## 4.2.1 Types of Mutations

**Point Mutations**

One must first make the distinction between large-scale mutations, where a whole chunk of a chromosome is lost, relocated, or rearranged, vs. point mutation. A point mutation is typically a change in just one base pair in a DNA molecule, and a difference of even only one nucleotide can be enough to cause significant problems in the body.

For example, sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that results because of a difference in a single nucleotide in the DNA of a carrier when compared to the DNA of a non-carrier. This difference occurs in the gene that codes for one of the subunits of hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen through the bloodstream.

**Spontaneous Mutations**

Some mutations are spontaneous errors in replication that evade the proofreading function of the DNA polymerases that synthesize new polynucleotides at the replication fork. These mutations are called mismatches because they are positions where the nucleotide that is inserted into the daughter polynucleotide does not match, by base-pairing, the nucleotide at the corresponding position in the template DNA.

**Induced Mutations**

One such mutagen is radiation. Photons of light from the ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum are high-energy particles, and if they collide with DNA in specific locations, they can cause pyrimidine dimers, which is when two adjacent thymine or cytosine bases become covalently linked, which distorts DNA, making normal genetic activity impossible.

## 4.2.2 Functional Consequences of Mutations

**Gain-of-Function vs Loss-of-Function**

Gain-of-function mutations are much less common. The mutation must be one that confers an abnormal activity on a protein. Many gain-of-function mutations are in regulatory sequences rather than in coding regions. For example, a mutation might lead to one or more genes being expressed in the wrong tissues, or could lead to overexpression of one or more genes involved in control of the cell cycle, thus leading to uncontrolled cell division and hence to cancer. Because of their nature, gain-of-function mutations are usually dominant. A loss-of-function mutation is usually recessive because a functional version of the gene is present on the second chromosome copy.

## 4.2.3 Somatic Mutations in Cancer

A somatic mutation describes any alteration at the cellular level in somatic tissues occurring after fertilization. These mutations do not involve the germline and consequently do not pass on to offspring. Somatic mutations are a normal part of aging and occur throughout an organism's life cycle either spontaneously as a result of errors in DNA repair mechanisms or a direct response to stress.

**Accumulation of Somatic Mutations**

As a result of defects in tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, and genes required for genome stability, the individual inherits an increased risk for cancer in corresponding genes as somatic mutations continue to accumulate within already unstable genes. The mutations can build up faster than repair mechanisms can repair, rendering DNA repair ineffective, resulting in loss of function in the respective gene.

**Cancer Development Through Mutations**

The somatic mutation theory became widely accepted as the primary cause of cancer. The carcinogenesis process involves multiple events of genetic DNA damage (mutations) and epigenetic modifications in gene expression that accumulate sequentially. These changes contribute to the gradual acquisition of the hallmarks of cancer, ultimately resulting in fully developed, metastatic cancer.

## 4.2.4 Mutation Rates and Cancer Risk

Recent studies estimate the rate of mutation accumulation to range from 13 to 44 mutations per genome per year. This rate increases with exposure to environmental factors that induce DNA abnormalities, such as radiation, smoking, pollutants, and alcohol.

The density of single-nucleotide mutations across a genome differs by nearly 4 orders of magnitude (> 10 000-fold) between cancer types with strong environmental factors and tumours with little such evidence, such as paediatric cancers.
