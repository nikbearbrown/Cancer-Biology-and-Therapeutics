title: 4.4 DNA Repair Mechanisms and Their Failure in Cancer
---


Most spontaneous changes in DNA are temporary because they are immediately corrected by a set of processes that are collectively called DNA repair. Of the thousands of random changes created every day in the DNA of a human cell by heat, metabolic accidents, radiation of various sorts, maintaining genetic stability requires not only an extremely accurate mechanism for replicating DNA, but also mechanisms for repairing the many accidental lesions that occur continually in DNA.

## 4.4.1 Overview of DNA Damage

DNA is the template from which everything inside the human body is built, so it is incredibly important that nothing happens to this code. Unfortunately, the DNA is at constant risk of mutation, which means a change to the genetic information in a cell, and this can happen due to a variety of factors.

## 4.4.2 Major DNA Repair Pathways

**Base Excision Repair**

Base excision repair works by excising a single damaged base or nucleotide; this is under the mediation of DNA glycosylases cutting the bond between the nitrogenous base and the deoxyribose sugars. When the glycosylases remove the base, it creates an apurinic site if the removed base was a purine (adenine, guanine), or an apyrimidinic site if the excised base was a pyrimidine (cytosine, thymine).

As an example of the general mechanism of base excision repair, the removal of a deaminated C by uracil DNA glycosylase is shown. A key step is an enzyme-mediated "flipping-out" of the altered nucleotide from the helix, which allows the enzyme to probe all faces of the base for damage. It is thought that DNA glycosylases travel along DNA using base-flipping to evaluate the status of each base pair.

**Nucleotide Excision Repair**

Nucleotide excision repair is most common when exposure to UV radiation has caused the formation of pyrimidine dimers. A nuclease enzyme can spot the problem and snip out a section of the DNA strand containing the lesion. Then polymerase puts new bases in the gap, and ligase seals it up, correcting the error.

The second major repair pathway is called nucleotide excision repair. This mechanism can repair the damage caused by almost any large change in the structure of the DNA double helix. Such "bulky lesions" include those created by the covalent reaction of DNA bases with large hydrocarbons, as well as the various pyrimidine dimers caused by sunlight.

**Mismatch Repair**

Mismatch repair is a type of correcting mechanism that fixes mistakes in DNA after replication or transcription that remain uncorrected by the exonuclease function of DNA polymerase, specifically bases that incorrectly match with the wrong base on the complementary strand. This strand-directed mismatch repair system detects the potential for distortion in the DNA helix that results from the misfit between noncomplementary base pairs.

The importance of this system is indicated by the fact that individuals who inherit one defective copy of a mismatch repair gene have a marked predisposition for certain types of cancers.

## 4.4.3 Double-Strand Break Repair

A chromosomal double-strand break (DSB) can arise from multiple sources including ionizing radiation and DNA replication itself. The ATM kinase plays an early, pivotal role in the signaling process by detecting DSBs and relaying this information to numerous downstream transducer and effector proteins.

A potentially dangerous type of DNA damage occurs when both strands of the double helix are broken, leaving no intact template strand for repair. Breaks of this type are caused by ionizing radiation, oxidizing agents, replication errors, and certain metabolic products in the cell. If these lesions were left unrepaired, they would quickly lead to the breakdown of chromosomes into smaller fragments.

## 4.4.4 DNA Repair Defects and Cancer

**Hereditary Cancer Syndromes**

Mutations in at least 30 DNA-repair-associated genes have been linked to increased cancer susceptibility or premature aging. This is the mutator phenotype.

Mutations in genes for proteins responsible for mismatch repairs such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 can result in certain cancers such as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (also known as Lynch Syndrome) and ovarian cancers.

**Xeroderma Pigmentosum**

One of the best characterized of these is xeroderma pigmentosum, which results from a mutation in any one of several genes for proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair. Nucleotide excision is the only way in which human cells can repair cyclobutyl dimers and other photoproducts, so it is no surprise that the symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum include hypersensitivity to UV radiation, patients suffering more mutations than normal on exposure to sunlight, which often leads to skin cancer.

**Clinical Significance**

The 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Tomas Lindahl and Aziz Sancar for their groundbreaking research on fundamental DNA repair mechanisms, including mismatch repair, base excision repair, and nucleotide excision repair. If DNA damage is irreparable, the affected cells undergo programmed cell death, also known as apoptosis.

## 4.4.5 DNA Repair Surveillance

There are over 100 different types of DNA repair enzymes in every cell in our body, keeping constant vigil over the sacred genetic code.

All cells possess DNA-repair enzymes that attempt to minimize the number of mutations that occur. These enzymes work in two ways. Some are pre-replicative and search the DNA for nucleotides with unusual structures, these being replaced before replication occurs; others are post-replicative and check newly synthesized DNA for errors, correcting any errors that they find.
