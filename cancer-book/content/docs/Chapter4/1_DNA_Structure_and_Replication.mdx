title: 4.1 DNA Structure and Replication

The relationship between DNA and cancer is fundamental, as cancer is ultimately a disease of altered genetic information. Understanding DNA structure and the replication process provides critical insights into how genetic alterations arise and contribute to carcinogenesis.

## 4.1.1 DNA Structure and Organization

DNA serves as the repository of genetic information in all living organisms. The structure consists of two polynucleotide strands coiled around each other in a double helix, where each strand acts as a template for synthesis of a new complementary daughter strand.

**Nucleotides and Base Pairing**

The building blocks of DNA are nucleotides, each composed of a deoxyribose sugar, phosphate group, and nitrogenous base. The four nitrogenous bases in DNA are adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs: adenine pairs with thymine through two hydrogen bonds, and guanine pairs with cytosine through three hydrogen bonds.

**DNA Packaging in Chromosomes**

The entire DNA strand must fit within the nucleus of a cell, so it must be very tightly packaged. This is accomplished by wrapping the DNA around structural histone proteins, which act as scaffolding for the DNA to be coiled around. The entire structure is called a nucleosome, each of which includes an octamer of histone proteins and 146 to 147 base pairs of DNA. The millions of nucleosomes tightly coil the continuous DNA strand into chromatin which is further condensed into the chromosome classically visualized during cell division.

**Chromatin Organization**

In addition to the need for systematic compaction of DNA for replication and cell division, it is important for the interphase cell to have its DNA organized within the nucleus. This organization helps to section the DNA into different areas of cell expression, among other functions. Eukaryotic DNA is organized into loops, which can vary from 25 to 200 base pairs long.

## 4.1.2 DNA Replication Process

DNA replication is a semiconservative process in which each parental strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary daughter strand. The central enzyme involved is DNA polymerase, which catalyzes the joining of deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphates (dNTPs) to form the growing DNA chain.

**Replication Initiation**

The replication of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNAs starts at a unique sequence called the origin of replication, which serves as a specific binding site for proteins that initiate the replication process. Eukaryotes have multiple origins of replication whereas prokaryotes have one. Replication begins when origin-binding proteins bind to the origin of replication on the DNA.

**The Replication Fork**

An active zone of DNA replication moves progressively along a replicating DNA molecule, creating a Y-shaped DNA structure known as a replication fork. Then the unwinding of the double helix proceeds by way of the enzyme, helicase, creating a replication fork. Single-stranded binding proteins (SSBs) stabilize the unwound DNA, preventing it from forming into secondary structures.

**Leading and Lagging Strands**

The DNA daughter strand that is synthesized continuously is known as the leading strand. Its synthesis slightly precedes the synthesis of the daughter strand that is synthesized discontinuously, known as the lagging strand. For the lagging strand, the direction of nucleotide polymerization is opposite to the overall direction of DNA chain growth. The synthesis of the lagging strand by a discontinuous "backstitching" mechanism means that only the 5′-to-3′ type of DNA polymerase is needed for DNA replication.

**Okazaki Fragments**

Researchers added highly radioactive ³H-thymidine to dividing bacteria for a few seconds, revealing the transient existence of pieces of DNA that were 1000–2000 nucleotides long, now commonly known as Okazaki fragments, at the growing replication fork. (Similar replication intermediates were later found in eucaryotes, where they are only 100–200 nucleotides long.) The Okazaki fragments were shown to be polymerized only in the 5′-to-3′chain direction and to be joined together after their synthesis to create long DNA chains.

## 4.1.3 Accuracy of DNA Replication

The accuracy of DNA replication is critical to cell reproduction, and estimates of mutation rates for a variety of genes indicate that the frequency of errors during replication corresponds to only one incorrect base per 10⁹ to 10¹⁰ nucleotides incorporated. This error frequency is much lower than would be predicted simply on the basis of complementary base pairing.

**Proofreading Mechanisms**

Most of these errors are corrected by DNA polymerase during replication with its inherent proofreading mechanism via its 3′-exonuclease activity. This mechanism allows for the polymerase to read the most recently placed base before adding the next one. If the base does not pair correctly with the base on the template strand, then the exonuclease mechanism cuts the phosphodiester bond and releases the nucleotide.

Combined with the ability to discriminate against the insertion of mismatched bases, the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases is sufficient to reduce the error frequency of replication to about one mismatched base per 10⁹. Additional mechanisms act to remove mismatched bases that have been incorporated into newly synthesized DNA, further ensuring correct replication of the genetic information.

## 4.1.4 DNA Replication and Cancer

Cancers can arise from errors or mutations in DNA replication. The function of DNA replication is multifold and essential to life as we know it. This biological process allows for the genetic blueprints of a cell to be passed on to daughter cells in cell division without loss of genetic information.

Most cells in the body go through a cycle of life in which their genetic information is retained, fixed, and passed down to daughter cells through a highly coordinated and regulated process. However, during this cell cycle, there are many situations where mistakes are made by the cycle or by a regulating system that causes the cell to proliferate uncontrollably, leading to cancer.
