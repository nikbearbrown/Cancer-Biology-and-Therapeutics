title: 4.3 Chromosomal Abnormalities
---


Chromosomal abnormalities are hallmarks of cancer cells and play crucial roles in cancer initiation, progression, and evolution. These abnormalities range from numerical changes affecting entire chromosomes to structural rearrangements.

## 4.3.1 Types of Chromosomal Abnormalities

**Numerical Abnormalities**

Many cancer cells contain large quantities of mutant p53 protein, suggesting that the genetic accidents they undergo have created signals that normally call p53 into play. The loss of p53 activity leads to the genetic instability characteristic of cancer cells, allowing further cancer-promoting mutations to accumulate as they divide. A common consequence is that chromosomes become fragmented and incorrectly rejoined, creating, through further rounds of cell division, an increasingly disrupted genome.

**Structural Abnormalities**

Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), named after the city where it was first described, was described for the first time by Nowell and Hungerford in 1960, in two patients who had lost the long arm of chromosome 22. As the Giemsa staining improved over the decade, Rowley showed that this truncated chromosome was generated as a result of the translocation of the long arm of chromosomes 9 and 22.

Philadelphia chromosome is the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) along with some other leukemias including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL), and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL).

## 4.3.2 Chromosomal Instability Syndromes

Chromosomal instability syndromes are a group of inherited disorders associated with chromosomal instability and breakage spontaneously or in response to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging agents. Most of these syndromes are significant because they are associated with variable degrees of immunodeficiency, infectious disease, and the risk of developing certain malignancies.

**Specific Syndromes**

Bloom syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a lack of BLM helicase enzyme, resulting from a mutation in the BLM gene. Fanconi anemia is a DNA repair disorder where cells cannot repair DNA damage caused by interstrand cross-links. This defect eventually leads to chromosomal instability, particularly upon exposure to cytotoxic therapies, and a general predisposition to certain cancers.

## 4.3.3 Detection Methods

Chromosomes from a breast tumor displaying abnormalities in structure and number. Chromosomes were prepared from a breast tumor cell in metaphase, spread on a glass slide, and stained with a general DNA stain or a combination of fluorescent stains. Different tumors—even from the same tissues—can show different kinds of genetic instability, caused by mutations in one or another of a very specific set of genes whose products are needed to protect the genome from alteration.

## 4.3.4 Clinical Significance

In some cases, a specific gross chromosomal abnormality, visible under the microscope, is repeatedly associated with a particular type of cancer. This can give a clue to the location of either an oncogene that is activated as a result of the chromosomal rearrangement or a tumor suppressor gene that is deleted.
