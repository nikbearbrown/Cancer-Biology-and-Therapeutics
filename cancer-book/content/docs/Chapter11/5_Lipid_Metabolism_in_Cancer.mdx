## 11.4.1 Fatty Acid Synthesis and Cancer

**De Novo Lipid Synthesis**

Endogenous fatty acid synthesis is frequently upregulated in cancer because fatty acids can serve as substrates to produce lipid signaling molecules, modify protein functions through lipidation, synthesize phospholipids for cell membranes, or store energy as triglycerides. The primary source of carbons for fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells comes from glucose.

Glucose carbon is incorporated into acetyl-CoA, which then forms citrate in the mitochondria. The mitochondrial citrate transporter protein (CTP) carries citrate from the mitochondria to the cytosol. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), a key enzyme of de novo fatty acid synthesis (DNLS), cleaves cytosolic citrate into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate.

**Enzyme Regulation**

ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is found to be elevated in many types of cancers, including breast, lung, liver, and bladder cancers. The Avantaggiati research group has extensively studied the mitochondrial citrate transporter protein (CTP) and demonstrated that CTP plays an important role in preventing mitochondrial damage and preserving its function, such as in cellular bioenergetics.

The inhibition of CTP resulted in anti-tumorigenesis in vivo. Although the authors observed a decrease in fatty acid synthesis from glucose due to the suppression of CTP-dependent transport of citrate by a benzene-tricarboxylate analog (BTA), they believe that this effect only played a partial role in tumor reduction because the total FA levels were not drastically affected.

## 11.4.2 Fatty Acid Oxidation

Mitochondria fatty acid Î²-oxidation (FAO) involves the breakdown of energy-rich lipid molecules and plays a crucial role in the bioenergy metabolism exploited by cancer cells. The upregulation of FAO in cancer cells provides energy and metabolic flexibility.

The lipid metabolism dysregulation has been observed in both cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The alterations in FAO vary depending on the specific disease and the stage of the disease. The role of FAO is especially important, considering that it is the predominant pathway utilized by many cell types for energy production.

## 11.4.3 Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts and Lipid Metabolism

New research performed by Zhao et al. in 2020 has shown that CAFs overexpress FASN and undergo lipidomic reprogramming to help colorectal cancer cells meet their high energy demands by providing them with newly synthesized lipids. Nineteen lipids were specifically identified that were produced and secreted by CAFs and taken up by colorectal cancer cells.

Accumulation of fatty acids in the TME could serve as a nutrient reservoir for cancer cell growth during nutrient deprivation. Taken together, stromal catabolites, such as free fatty acids, promote tumor growth, and act as chemoattractants to metastasizing cancer cells.
