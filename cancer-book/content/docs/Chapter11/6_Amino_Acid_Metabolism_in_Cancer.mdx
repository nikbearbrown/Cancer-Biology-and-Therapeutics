## 11.5.1 Glutamine Metabolism

**Glutamine as a Critical Nutrient**

Glutamine is one of the most abundant nonessential amino acids in the bloodstream (produced by the human body and thus not an essential part of the diet) and contributes to virtually every biosynthetic pathway in proliferating cells. Moreover, it acts as a nitrogen donor in purine and pyrimidine synthesis as well as a precursor for protein and glutathione biosynthesis.

Many tumor cells are reliant on exogenous glutamine and have been reported to die in its absence. Since glutamine-derived α-KG fuels the TCA cycle, cancer cells can employ glutaminolysis to sustain the biosynthesis of many essential molecules.

**Glutaminolysis Pathway**

Glutamate can be further catabolized through the TCA cycle (via conversion to α KG) or serve as a substrate for glutathione synthesis. α-KG formation can be catalyzed by either glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) or aminotransferases. Alternatively, glutamate can be further converted to glutathione by glutathione cysteine ligase and glutathione synthetase.

Glutathione is an antioxidant vital to a cell's immune defense, nutrient metabolism, and cellular functions. It also plays an important role in the neutralization of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are by-products of oxygen metabolism, the concentration of which plays a vital role in tumor proliferation, growth, apoptosis, and metastasis.

## 11.5.2 Serine and Glycine Metabolism

SHMT catalyzes the conversion of serine to glycine and is regulated by c-MYC, an oncogene that controls the transcription of 15% of human genes. Glycine is a component of glutathione and is required for regulating cellular redox balance. It also fuels nucleotide biosynthesis and sustains oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Thus, glycine metabolism has been shown to promote rapid tumor proliferation.

In an attempt to block glycine biosynthesis, researchers are using antimetabolites (drugs that interfere with the effects of metabolites), methotrexate, and pemetrexed to inhibit SHMT. Since serine and glycine are considered nonessential, their depletion can be tolerated in vivo. Maddocks et al. found that mice fed diets lacking serine and glycine showed a reduction in tumor sizes and survived longer than those fed diets containing the amino acids, indicating that diet regulation may be a potential therapy for investigation.

## 11.5.3 Therapeutic Targeting of Amino Acid Metabolism

**Glutaminase Inhibition**

Inhibition of GLS2 can block glutaminolysis, decrease the hepatic metabolic flux from glutamine to glucose, decrease the initial blood glucose level, and increase insulin sensitivity. Despite some attempts to study the selective inhibition of GLS1 and GLS2, there has not been a defined pharmacological inhibition of GLS2 that is qualified for general use in research.

In addition to blocking glutamate production from glutamine, glutamine supplementation has also been proven effective in cardiovascular disease prevention and sickle cell disease treatment and is used in combination with chemotherapy for cancer treatment. In cancer treatment, the use of dietary glutamine supplementation is to make up for the tumor's "nitrogen trap" behavior that aggressively consumes dietary amino acids as well as the amino acids synthesized by the host.
