title: 11.8 Future Directions and Clinical Translation

## 11.8.1 Personalized Metabolic Therapy

There is heterogeneity in glucose metabolism across tumor types as well as within the tumor microenvironment. Numerous therapies targeting glucose metabolism have been developed but have yet to show success in clinical trials. This highlights the need for better patient selection and understanding of metabolic heterogeneity.

The tumor microenvironment influences the sensitivity of cancer cells to lipid synthesis inhibition. Understanding these contextual factors will be crucial for successful clinical translation of metabolic therapies.

## 11.8.2 Integration with Other Treatment Modalities

Natural products can also increase the sensitivity of HCC cells to anticancer drugs by regulating cellular metabolism. Li and colleagues demonstrated that dauricine dose-dependently suppressed glucose glycolysis and increased oxidative phosphorylation by downregulating the expression of hexokinase 2 and pyruvate kinase M2, consequently increasing the sensitivities of HCC to cisplatin, sorafenib, and isoliensinie.

Experimental data show that natural products can reverse MDR via regulating drug efflux, drug metabolism, and apoptotic pathways in cancer cells. Despite a better understanding of the mechanisms of drug resistance, and the experimental approaches that have been taken to overcome drug resistance over the decades, clinical utility of these approaches has not come to fruition.

## 11.8.3 Systems Biology Approaches

Simply put, what makes cancer one of the deadliest diseases is its ability to change and adapt. Cancer cells' rapid evolution, coupled with their irrepressible ability to divide, gives most of them the advantage over our immune systems.

The logical question that arises is simple: Why, despite all the technologies and medical innovations of our time, has a complete cure eluded us? This chapter sheds light on one of cancer's most impactful attributes: its heterogeneity and, more specifically, the intratumoral heterogeneity of cancer metabolism.
