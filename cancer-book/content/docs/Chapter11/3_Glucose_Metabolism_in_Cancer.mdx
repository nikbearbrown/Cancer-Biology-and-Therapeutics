## 11.2.1 Glycolytic Pathway Regulation

**Basic Glycolysis Pathway**

Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway and an anaerobic energy source that has evolved in nearly all types of organisms. The process entails the oxidation of glucose molecules, the single most crucial organic fuel in plants, microbes, and animals. In glycolysis, 2 ATP molecules are consumed, producing 4 ATP, 2 NADH, and 2 pyruvates per glucose molecule.

Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol of the cell. It is a metabolic pathway that creates ATP without the use of oxygen but can occur in the presence of oxygen. In cells that use aerobic respiration as the primary energy source, the pyruvate formed from the pathway can be used in the citric acid cycle and go through oxidative phosphorylation to undergo oxidation into carbon dioxide and water.

**Enhanced Glycolysis in Cancer**

Tumor cells exhibit an upregulation in glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and gluconeogenesis as opposed to normal cells. Several oncogenes and tumor suppressors drive the metabolic reprogramming underlying the Warburg effect and other changes in glucose metabolism.

The amount of glucose available for the process regulates glycolysis, which becomes available primarily in two ways: regulation of glucose reuptake or regulation of the breakdown of glycogen. As described before, many enzymes are involved in the glycolytic pathway by converting one intermediate to another. Control of these enzymes, such as hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase, is crucial for cancer metabolism.

## 11.2.2 The Reverse Warburg Effect

The Warburg effect, a phenomenon initially believed to be limited to cancer cells, has also been observed in the fibroblasts surrounding the cancer cells. To distinguish this CAF-related phenomenon from its cancer cell-related counterpart, Pavlides et al. named it the reverse Warburg effect.

Subsequently, HIF-1, a regulator of all glycolytic enzymes, as well as glucose transporters, GLUT1 and GLUT3, induces aerobic glycolysis. A similar study performed by Shan et al. provided further evidence to support the reverse Warburg effect hypothesis. In this study, pancreatic associated fibroblasts expressed elevated levels of the glycolytic enzymes LDHA and PKM2, as well as the MCT4 transporter responsible for lactate secretion.

Additionally, they observed that when pancreatic cancer cells were exposed to CAF-conditioned media, they underwent enhanced aerobic activity, causing an observable enlargement of the mitochondria. Furthermore, pancreatic cancer cells significantly increased the expression of MCT1, fumarate hydratase (FH), and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). The overexpression of these enzymes further indicated the existence of metabolic coupling between CAFs and cancer cells.

## 11.2.3 Therapeutic Targeting of Glucose Metabolism

Consequently, this has resulted in increased research addressing the production of commercial GLUT inhibitors and the transporter isoform specificity of inhibition. Other drugs have been developed to target the hypoxic pathways of cancer cells, such as topotecan, which inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transcriptional activity and HIF-1α protein accumulation in hypoxia-treated U251 human glioma cells.

Many drugs have followed with variable success that act by blocking mRNA transcription of the HIF-1α gene. Recent research has also provided many other pathways in cancer metabolism that can be targeted with effective results. For example, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), an enzyme involved in the generation of lactate from glucose in Warburg effect-displaying cells, has also been found to be a suitable target for effective tumor reduction through small-molecule inhibition.
