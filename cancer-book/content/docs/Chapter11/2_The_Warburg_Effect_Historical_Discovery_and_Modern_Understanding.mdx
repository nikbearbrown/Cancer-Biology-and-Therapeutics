title: 11.1 The Warburg Effect - Historical Discovery and Modern Understanding
---


## 11.1.1 Historical Perspective

Otto Warburg observed a peculiar phenomenon in 1924, unknowingly laying the foundation for the field of cancer metabolism. While his contemporaries hypothesized that tumor cells derived the energy required for uncontrolled replication from proteolysis and lipolysis, Warburg instead found them to rapidly consume glucose.

In 1927, Warburg studied the processes of respiration and fermentation in tumor cells. According to normal cellular respiration, glucose is converted to pyruvate, which then enters the TCA cycle to undergo oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of oxygen, and there should be minimal lactate production. However, in his in vivo and ex vivo studies, Warburg observed an increased glucose uptake and increased lactic acid production in tumor cells as compared to normal cells, even in the presence of oxygen.

This phenomenon, the metabolism of glucose to lactate despite the presence of adequate oxygen, is called the Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis. For Warburg, several questions remained unanswered, including why cancer cells would inefficiently shunt glucose-derived pyruvate to lactate production instead of to the TCA cycle, which would result in significantly higher ATP production.

## 11.1.2 Contemporary Understanding

**Efficiency and Kinetics**

Given the inefficiency of ATP production in the Warburg effect, there are likely differences in the kinetics of aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, which have led to cancer cells promoting aerobic glycolysis. Demetrios et al. found that, in the Warburg effect, the flux of glucose to lactate is up to 100 times faster than through the TCA cycle resulting in similar amounts of ATP production over the same time. Even when oxidative phosphorylation is actively continuing, aerobic glycolysis will see much higher glucose flux.

**Anabolic Requirements**

To further understand a cancer cell's dependence on aerobic glycolysis, it is necessary to revisit one of the hallmarks of cancerâ€”rapid proliferation supported by strong anabolism. Tumor cells need not only ATP but also anabolic metabolism to accumulate a large amount of biomass to sustain their growth.

**Clinical Applications**

PET is an exploitation of the high rate of glycolysis in cancer cells as it uses a radiolabeled glucose analog, [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG), which accumulates in tumor cells due to their rapid uptake of glucose. Another developing application of the Warburg effect is the use of gene expression profiles linked to glycolysis to determine prognosis. Tools in both lung adenocarcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer have shown that glycolytic phenotypes are generally associated with worse patient survival.

## 11.1.3 Metabolic Heterogeneity

For a long time, it was believed that cancer cells' major metabolic footprint was the Warburg effect, which dictates that cancer cells undergo glycolysis to produce lactic acid even in the presence of oxygen, a process termed aerobic glycolysis. Although the Warburg effect is still relevant, it has recently become clear that the metabolic phenotypes of cancer cells are far more varied and intricate.

In a recent study published by Le et al., the identification of genetic variability within the same tumor also revealed distinct metabolic profiles of each cell subpopulation within a given tumor. In addition to the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) positive and/or cycling cells (Warburg effect-displaying cells), they found that the subpopulation that was HIF negative and non-cycling expressed a distinct set of genes with increased expression of mitochondrial genes as compared to other subpopulations.
