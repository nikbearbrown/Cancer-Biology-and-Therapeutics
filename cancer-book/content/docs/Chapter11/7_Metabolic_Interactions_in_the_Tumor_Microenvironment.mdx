title: 11.6 Metabolic Interactions in the Tumor Microenvironment

## 11.6.1 Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs)

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a major component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), play an important role in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. Recent findings have demonstrated that the TME not only provides physical support for cancer cells but also directs cell-to-cell interactions (in this case, the interaction between cancer cells and CAFs).

As cancer progresses, the CAFs also coevolve, transitioning from an inactivated state to an activated state. The elucidation and understanding of the interaction between cancer cells and CAFs will pave the way for new cancer therapies.

## 11.6.2 Metabolic Cross-Talk

**Lactate Shuttle**

Pyruvate and lactate, the two end products of glycolysis, were believed to be secreted by the hypoxic core of the tumor through monocarboxylate transporters (MCT4) for the adjacent oxygenated cancer cells to take up (via MCT1) and utilize as substrates for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

By providing lactate and ketone bodies, acidic compounds that can form acetyl-CoA in a reversible manner, and by taking up reactive oxygen species that promote glycolytic metabolic pathways, CAFs establish a fundamental relationship with adjacent cancer cells. CAFs are also involved in the maintenance of an acidic extracellular environment, providing suitable conditions for optimal cancer cell growth.

**Mitochondrial Transfer**

CAFs can transfer functional mitochondria to prostate cancer cells. Much research has been focused on exosomes secreted by cancer cells, while little is known about exosomes secreted by CAFs. CAF-derived exosomes (CDEs) are taken up by cancer cells in a KRAS-independent mechanism and are, indeed, capable of reprogramming the metabolic activity of pancreatic and prostate cancer cells.

They demonstrated how CDE can sustain the rapidly dividing cancer cells under hypoxic conditions or when the normal oxidative mitochondrial function has been disabled. Additionally, the presence of CDEs can rescue prostate and pancreatic cancer cells from starvation by providing de novo-synthesized metabolites, such as amino acids.

## 11.6.3 Alanine Metabolism

In the case of PDAC, it is evident that the secretion of alanine by PSCs (myofibroblast-like pancreatic stellate cells) is sufficient to rescue cancer cells in low-nutrient environments. It was noted that alanine, not glucose, is used in the TCA cycle. This allows glucose to enter the serine biosynthetic pathway to generate nucleic acids, further contributing to the rapid cancer cell proliferation.
