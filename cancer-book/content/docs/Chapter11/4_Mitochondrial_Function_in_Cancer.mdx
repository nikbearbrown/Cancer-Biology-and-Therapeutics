## 11.3.1 Mitochondrial Structure and Function

Mitochondria play a critical role in the generation of metabolic energy in eukaryotic cells. They are responsible for most of the useful energy derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates and fatty acids, which is converted to ATP by the process of oxidative phosphorylation.

Mitochondria are surrounded by a double-membrane system, consisting of inner and outer mitochondrial membranes separated by an intermembrane space. The inner membrane is highly specialized. Its lipid bilayer contains a high proportion of the "double" phospholipid cardiolipin, which has four fatty acids rather than two and may help to make the membrane especially impermeable to ions.

## 11.3.2 Mitochondria in Cancer Metabolism

**Energy Production**

Without mitochondria, present-day animal cells would be dependent on anaerobic glycolysis for all of their ATP. When glucose is converted to pyruvate by glycolysis, only a very small fraction of the total free energy potentially available from the glucose is released. In mitochondria, the metabolism of sugars is completed: the pyruvate is imported into the mitochondrion and oxidized by O2 to CO2 and H2O. This allows 15 times more ATP to be made than that produced by glycolysis alone.

Mitochondria occupy a substantial portion of the cytoplasmic volume of eucaryotic cells, and they have been essential for the evolution of complex animals. Time-lapse microcinematography of living cells, however, shows that mitochondria are remarkably mobile and plastic organelles, constantly changing their shape and even fusing with one another and then separating again.

**Metabolic Integration**

The matrix enzymes include those that metabolize pyruvate and fatty acids to produce acetyl CoA and those that oxidize acetyl CoA in the citric acid cycle. The principal end-products of this oxidation are CO2, which is released from the cell as waste, and NADH, which is the main source of electrons for transport along the respiratory chainâ€”the name given to the electron-transport chain in mitochondria.

Mitochondria can use both pyruvate and fatty acids as fuel. Pyruvate comes from glucose and other sugars, whereas fatty acids come from fats. Both of these fuel molecules are transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane and then converted to the crucial metabolic intermediate acetyl CoA by enzymes located in the mitochondrial matrix.

## 11.3.3 Mitochondrial Protein Import and Assembly

Most mitochondrial proteins are translated on free cytosolic ribosomes and imported into the organelle by specific targeting signals. The assembly of mitochondria thus involves proteins encoded by their own genomes and translated within the organelle, as well as proteins encoded by the nuclear genome and imported from the cytosol.

The nucleus contains the genes that encode most of the mitochondrial proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation and all of the enzymes involved in mitochondrial metabolism (e.g., enzymes of the citric acid cycle). The proteins encoded by these genes (more than 95% of mitochondrial proteins) are synthesized on free cytosolic ribosomes and imported into mitochondria as completed polypeptide chains.
