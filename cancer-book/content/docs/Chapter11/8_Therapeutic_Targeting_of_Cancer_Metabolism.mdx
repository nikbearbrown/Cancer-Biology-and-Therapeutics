## 11.7.1 Targeting Glycolysis

In order to disrupt the metabolic bridge in CAF-cancer cell interactions through glycolysis and lactate metabolism inhibition, three potential strategies have been proposed. First, elevated expression of the lactate transporter MCT1 in cancer cells is a potential target for blocking cellular uptake of two types of mitochondrial fuels, ketone bodies and lactate.

MCT1 and MCT2 inhibitors can block the influx and efflux of lactate produced by either CAFs or cancer cells. Thus, due to the rapid accumulation of lactate and protons within cancer cells by inhibiting lactate influx/efflux, rapid acidification can occur in cancer cells and the TME, resulting in lactic acidosis.

For instance, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (ACCA), an MCT inhibitor, not only inhibits lactic acid efflux in glycolytic gliomas but also disrupts redox hemostasis and enhances radiosensitivity. AZD3965, an MCT1 inhibitor, is currently being tested in phase I clinical trial in solid tumors.

## 11.7.2 Targeting Lipid Metabolism

The first fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitor, TVB-2640, is in clinical trials for cancer. Markers such as cell type, oncogene mutations, expression/activity of lipid synthesis enzymes, and metabolic profiles can be used to predict cancer cell sensitivity to lipid synthesis inhibition.

The fact that lipoprotein supplementation can override DNLS inhibition emphasizes the importance of nutrient availability and, again, the role of exogenous lipid uptake. The availability of glucose for glucose-dependent lipogenesis is also important for cancer cell sensitivity to ACLY inhibitors. Low-glucose environments result in cancer cells that are less susceptible to ACLY inhibition because cancer cells can use acetate instead of citrate to produce acetyl-CoA for DNLS.

## 11.7.3 Combination Strategies

**Metabolic Inhibitor Combinations**

Elgogary et al. present another case of spatial metabolic heterogeneity. Pancreatic tumors were targeted by bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES), a glutaminase 1 (GLS1) inhibitor, which was encapsulated in a nanoparticle to enhance drug delivery. The drug decreased tumor sizes, but metabolomics analysis revealed that surviving tumors relied on glycolysis and glycogen synthesis instead. Thus, further combination therapy of BPTES and metformin, a drug frequently used to treat diabetes by blocking glucose synthesis, further reduced tumor size.

**Targeting CAF-Cancer Interactions**

Metabolic cross talk between CAFs and cancer can be a metabolic target for cancer therapy. The reverse Warburg effects can be targeted via disruption of the "lactate shuttle" by MCT1/MCT 4 inhibitors. Metformin can be used to inhibit glycolysis and block the function of CAFs, which promote cancer cell growth. Blocking the glutamine uptake of cancer cells from CAFs is a strategy in targeting glutaminolysis.

## 11.7.4 Challenges in Metabolic Targeting

**Drug Resistance and Metabolism**

The response to cytotoxic drugs often depends on the metabolic state of the cancer cells, and these cells rewire the metabolism of anticancer drugs. Metabolic alterations can be influenced by various factors such as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes and the tumor microenvironment.

Downstream of survival signaling pathways, the Warburg effect, which refers to the increased rate of glycolysis in tumorigenic cells, can be observed even in conditions of normal oxygen levels. In c-Myc-driven HCC, glucose catabolism through glycolysis is elevated via the activation of pyruvate kinase. Inhibition of glycolysis and increase in oxidative phosphorylation can re-sensitize HCC cells to chemotherapeutics such as sorafenib, cisplatin, and isoliensinine.

**Tumor Microenvironment Factors**

Solid tumors are heterogeneous structures. The tumor microenvironment is composed of cancer and stromal cells embedded in extracellular matrix, sustained by aberrant vasculature. Tumor hypoperfusion, secondary to the hyperpermeability of the aberrant vasculature, along with low oxygen, depleted nutrition, low pH, and high interstitial pressure can cause chemoresistance.

Compared to normal cells, cancer cells exhibit higher glucose metabolism rates and preferentially utilize glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, especially in hypoxic conditions (Warburg effect). This process ultimately generates lactic acid, leading to intracellular acidification. As a result, cancer cells may express relatively more proton pumps in order to maintain intracellular pH homeostasis, rendering the extracellular environment highly acidic.
