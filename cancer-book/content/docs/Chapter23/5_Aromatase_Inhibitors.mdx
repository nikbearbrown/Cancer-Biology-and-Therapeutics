title: 23.4 Aromatase Inhibitors
---


Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) represent a crucial class of hormonal therapies that block estrogen production by inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Aromatase (estrogen synthetase) is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of monooxygenases and catalyzes the demethylation of androgens' carbon 19, producing phenolic 18-carbon estrogens.

## 23.4.1 Mechanism of Action

In postmenopausal women, the conversion of androgens to estrogens via this pathway in the adrenal glands, the skin, the muscle, and the adipose tissue, is the primary source of estrogen. Aromatase inhibitors block this pathway and consequently suppress estrogen levels in postmenopausal women.

## 23.4.2 Classification

**Third-Generation Aromatase Inhibitors:**

**Nonsteroidal AIs (Type II):**
- Anastrozole (Arimidex)
- Letrozole (Femara)

**Steroidal AIs (Type I):**
- Exemestane (Aromasin)

## 23.4.3 Clinical Applications

**Adjuvant Therapy:**
The review found that aromatase inhibitors used as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer had a small benefit on disease-free (but not overall) survival compared to tamoxifen.

**Treatment Strategies:**
Upfront therapy: In upfront therapy after breast surgery, tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors are taken for five years. "Switch" treatment approach: In the "switch" treatment approach, the patient uses tamoxifen for two to three years, and then switches to an aromatase inhibitor. This anti-hormone treatment takes five years in total.

## 23.4.4 Dosing and Administration

Anastrozole, a selective aromatase inhibitor, is available as a 1 mg tablet, which is to be taken orally once a day, with or without food. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or liver impairment or elderly patients.

Letrozole is also a selective aromatase inhibitor. It is manufactured in 2.5 mg tablets. For postmenopausal breast cancer, dosing is 2.5 mg daily.

## 23.4.5 Comparative Efficacy

Although there were no significant differences between letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane in overall survival and progression-free survival for hormone-sensitive advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women, basic assumptions were not fulfilled for the indirect comparisons and network analysis and so the results must be interpreted with caution.

## 23.4.6 Side Effects

The rates of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and thromboembolic events were generally similar between the aromatase inhibitor and tamoxifen groups in six studies; aromatase inhibitors were associated with higher levels of fractures and osteoporosis and lower levels of gynaecological toxicities (including endometrial cancer) compared to tamoxifen.
