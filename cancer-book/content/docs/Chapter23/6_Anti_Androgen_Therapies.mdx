title: 23.5 Anti-Androgen Therapies
---


Anti-androgen therapies target the androgen signaling pathway through various mechanisms, including androgen receptor blockade and inhibition of androgen synthesis.

## 23.5.1 Androgen Receptor Antagonists

**Classification:**
Chemically, antiandrogens are classified into steroidal (such as cyproterone acetate) and nonsteroidal (including flutamide, nilutamide and bicalutamide).

**First-Generation Antiandrogens:**
- Flutamide
- Nilutamide
- Bicalutamide

**Second-Generation Antiandrogens:**
- Enzalutamide
- Apalutamide
- Darolutamide

### Enzalutamide

Enzalutamide is a third generation, oral nonsteroidal antiandrogen used in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

**Mechanism of Action:**
Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor antagonist which binds to the intracellular receptor and prevents its translocation to the nucleus and subsequent DNA binding thereby blocking its activity.

**Clinical Efficacy:**
Therapy with enzalutamide has been shown to prolong relapse free as well as overall survival in men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer who had previously failed other forms of treatment.

## 23.5.2 Combined Androgen Blockade

The concept of combined androgen blockade involves the simultaneous use of medical or surgical castration with an antiandrogen to block both testicular and adrenal androgen production.

Labrie and colleagues originally suggested that following androgen ablation, prostate cancer cells could adapt to decreased concentrations of androgens. They proposed that levels of androgens of adrenal origin were sufficient to maintain the hormone-dependent growth of these adapted prostate cancer cells.

**Clinical Evidence:**
However, on the basis of the findings in 24 of 27 randomized trials and two large meta-analyses, it can be concluded that CAB is not associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in survival over surgical or medical castration alone in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
