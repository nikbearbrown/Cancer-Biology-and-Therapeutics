## 23.3.1 Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs)

SERMs represent a class of compounds that demonstrate tissue-selective estrogen agonist or antagonist activity. The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are a group of nonsteroidal compounds that have estrogen-like effects (agonism) on some tissues (such as bone, skin, heart or vaginal epithelium), but antiestrogen effects (antagonism) on other tissues (such as breast or uterus).

### Tamoxifen

Tamoxifen is the prototype SERM and remains a cornerstone of breast cancer therapy. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) medication used to treat breast cancer in both men and women and as a prophylactic agent against breast cancer in women.

**Mechanism of Action:**
Tamoxifen exerts both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects depending on the tissue. The drug inhibits tumor growth in breast tissue while acting as an estrogen agonist in bone, which may help prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

**Clinical Applications:**
- Adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer
- Treatment of metastatic breast cancer
- Risk reduction in high-risk women
- Treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)

**Dosing and Administration:**
The ASCO guidelines for Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy of Hormone Receptorâ€“Positive Breast Cancer recommend a daily dosage of 20 mg for breast cancer prevention after the completion of chemotherapy. The duration of therapy depends on the patient's menopausal status and typically lasts between 5 and 10 years.

**Efficacy:**
The authors concluded that the breast cancer mortality rate could be halved with anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen in middle-aged women with oestrogen receptor-positive disease.

### Other SERMs

**Toremifene:** Similar to tamoxifen but with potentially fewer side effects

**Raloxifene:** Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that has estrogen-like effects (agonism) on bone and the cardiovascular system but antiestrogen activity (antagonism) on breast and uterus tissue. Primarily used for osteoporosis prevention but also shows breast cancer risk reduction.

## 23.3.2 Selective Estrogen Receptor Degraders (SERDs)

SERDs represent a newer class of anti-estrogen agents that bind to the estrogen receptor and promote its degradation, effectively eliminating receptor signaling.

**Fulvestrant:** The first SERD approved for clinical use
- Mechanism: Binds to ER and promotes receptor degradation
- Indications: Advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer
- Administration: Monthly intramuscular injection

**Advantages of SERDs:**
- Complete antagonism without partial agonist activity
- Effective in tamoxifen-resistant tumors
- Reduced risk of endometrial stimulation
