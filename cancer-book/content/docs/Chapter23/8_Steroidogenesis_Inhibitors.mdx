title: 23.7 Steroidogenesis Inhibitors
---


Steroidogenesis inhibitors represent a newer class of hormonal therapies that target specific enzymes involved in hormone synthesis.

## 23.7.1 Abiraterone Acetate

Abiraterone acetate is a semi-synthetic inhibitor of CYP17, a critical enzyme in the pathway of androgen production in the testes and adrenal glands.

**Mechanism of Action:**
The additional inhibition of androgenic steroid synthesis in the adrenals inhibits the growth of the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells.

**Clinical Efficacy:**
Therapy with abiraterone has been shown to prolong relapse-free as well as overall survival in men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.

**Administration:**
- Requires concomitant prednisone administration
- Taken on an empty stomach
- Monitoring of liver function and electrolytes required

## 23.7.2 Combination Therapy

Because it acts on another step in the pathway of androgen synthesis and action, abiraterone has been used in combination with agents that block androgen receptors such as enzalutamide and apalutamide, but the combination has not been found to be superior to abiraterone alone.

## 23.7.3 Hepatotoxicity

Abiraterone is associated with an appreciable rate of serum enzyme elevation during therapy and with rare but potentially severe instances of acute liver injury with jaundice.
