title: 23.8 Clinical Considerations and Patient Selection
---


## 23.8.1 Biomarker Testing

Accurate determination of hormone receptor status is essential for appropriate patient selection:
- Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) testing for breast cancer
- Androgen receptor (AR) testing for prostate cancer
- Immunohistochemical staining with quantitative assessment

## 23.8.2 Menopausal Status

Menopausal status significantly impacts treatment selection:
- Premenopausal women: Tamoxifen, ovarian suppression, or combination
- Postmenopausal women: Aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen

## 23.8.3 Cardiovascular Considerations

The use of ADT in prostate cancer patients corresponded with a significant increase in cardiovascular morbidity associated with AMI and with nonfatal events. Therefore, ADT is linked to a significant negative impact on quality of life. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation is required for these patients.

## 23.8.4 Bone Health

Long-term hormonal therapy impacts bone health:
- Aromatase inhibitors increase fracture risk
- Androgen deprivation therapy causes bone loss
- Bone density monitoring and prophylactic measures recommended

## 23.8.5 Quality of Life

In INT-0015, quality of life (QOL) was evaluated prospectively, and this study demonstrated that while improvement in QOL over baseline was seen in both arms, the improvement was more pronounced in the monotherapy group.
