## 23.2.1 Estrogen Signaling Pathway

Estrogen exerts its effects through both classical genomic and non-genomic pathways. Cellular physiological response to estrogen begins in the cell cytoplasm with estrogen binding to either alpha-estrogen receptor or beta-estrogen receptor. The activated estrogen-estrogen receptor complex then crosses into the nucleus of cells to induce DNA transcription by binding to nucleotide sequences known as estrogen response elements (ERE) to enact a physiological response.

The estrogen receptor exists in two main forms:
- ERα (estrogen receptor alpha): primarily mediates proliferative effects
- ERβ (estrogen receptor beta): often mediates anti-proliferative effects

## 23.2.2 Androgen Signaling Pathway

The prostate gland requires androgen (testosterone) to function optimally. Androgen signaling involves:
- Testosterone binding to the androgen receptor
- Receptor activation and nuclear translocation
- DNA binding and transcriptional regulation of target genes
- Promotion of cell survival and proliferation

The biological actions of testosterone and DHT are mediated by the androgen receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, which in response to hormone regulates gene expression in target tissues.

## 23.2.3 Coregulator Proteins and Tissue Specificity

Coregulatory proteins exist in a tissue-specific fashion and are highly context dependent. These features enable estrogen-like compounds called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) to act as an estrogen agonist (activating biological responses) in some tissues, such as in bone and the heart, and an antagonist (blocking biological responses) in others, including the uterus and breast, depending on the coregulator profile in the cells.
