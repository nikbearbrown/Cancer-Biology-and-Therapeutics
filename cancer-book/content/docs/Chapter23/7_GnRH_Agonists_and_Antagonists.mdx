title: 23.6 GnRH Agonists and Antagonists
---


Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs represent a fundamental component of hormonal therapy for both breast and prostate cancers.

## 23.6.1 Mechanism of Action

LHRH analogs are widely used in oncology, and their mode of action is almost completely understood. The mechanism of action of these analogs is mainly based on the inhibition of pituitary and gonadal function, but direct effects on various tumors may also play a role.

**GnRH Agonists:**
Continuous treatment with LHRH agonists causes a downregulation (a decrease in the number) of LHRH receptors and an uncoupling of the LHRH signal transduction mechanism. This results in a desensitization of gonadotrophs and a marked reduction in the secretion of bioactive LH and FSH.

**GnRH Antagonists:**
The principal mechanism of action of LHRH antagonists is the competitive occupancy of LHRH receptors, but recent experimental evidence documents that treatment with the LHRH antagonist cetrorelix also downregulates pituitary LHRH receptors in rats and decreases the levels of mRNA for LHRH receptors.

## 23.6.2 Available Agents

**GnRH Agonists:**
The commercial names and year of approval in the United States of the currently available forms of GnRH agonists and antagonists are: leuprolide, also called leuprorelin (Lupron: 1985), goserelin (Zoladex: 1989), histrelin (Supprelin, Vantas: 1991 and 2004), triptorelin (Trelstar: 2000).

**GnRH Antagonists:**
degarelix (Firmagon: 2008), and relugolix (Orgovyk: 2021).

## 23.6.3 Clinical Applications

**Prostate Cancer:**
Leuprolide acetate is a GnRH receptor agonist, also called a GnRH analog. Initially, the administration of leuprolide causes stimulation of pituitary gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which leads to an increase in steroidogenesis in ovaries and testes; thus resulting in increased estrogen in females and increased testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males.

**Testosterone Flare:**
Initial therapy with leuprolide, goserelin, and similar luteinizing hormoneâ€“releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists should be preceded with anti-androgen therapy to prevent testosterone flare.

**Advantages of GnRH Antagonists:**
Because relugolix is an antagonist of GnRH, it does not cause the initial increase in testosterone synthesis that occurs with use of GnRH agonists and generally has a more rapid onset of action.

## 23.6.4 Dosing and Administration

Long acting forms that allow for administration at 1, 3, 6 and even 12-month intervals are available for some GnRH analogues.

## 23.6.5 Side Effects

Common side effects of the GnRH agonists and antagonists include symptoms of hypogonadism such as hot flashes, gynecomastia, fatigue, weight gain, fluid retention, erectile dysfunction and decreased libido.
