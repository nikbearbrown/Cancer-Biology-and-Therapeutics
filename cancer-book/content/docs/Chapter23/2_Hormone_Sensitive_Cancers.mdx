## 23.1.1 Breast Cancer

Breast cancer represents the most extensively studied hormone-sensitive malignancy, with approximately 70% of breast cancers expressing estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. Estradiol and, other steroid hormones (eg, progesterone) drive breast cell proliferation, which facilitates the accumulation of random DNA copying errors in critical genes on the pathway to a malignant phenotype.

The hormone dependence of breast cancer was first recognized through clinical observations of the relationship between reproductive factors and breast cancer risk. Relative risk of breast cancer by time since last use of combined oral contraceptives demonstrates the impact of exogenous hormone exposure on cancer risk. The discovery of estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast tissue provided the molecular basis for hormone-targeted therapies.

Hormone receptor-positive breast cancers are characterized by:
- Expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±) and/or progesterone receptor (PR)
- Dependence on estrogen for growth and proliferation
- Generally better prognosis than hormone receptor-negative tumors
- Responsiveness to endocrine therapies

## 23.1.2 Prostate Cancer

Prostate cancer demonstrates a unique dependence on androgens, primarily testosterone and its more potent metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The prostate is an androgen-regulated organ, and there is little disagreement that androgens are the major stimulus for cell division in prostatic epithelium.

The androgen dependence of prostate cancer was first established by the pioneering work of Charles Huggins. In 1941, Dr. Charles Huggins, a urologist from the University of Chicago, discovered that androgen deprivation (castration) could cause prostate glands to atrophy and lead to the regression of prostate cancer. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1966 for his discovery, which is the basis for all hormonal (testosterone deprivation-based) treatments used in prostate cancer.

Prostate cancer characteristics include:
- Androgen receptor (AR) expression in virtually all cases
- Dependence on testosterone and DHT for growth
- Initial responsiveness to androgen deprivation therapy
- Eventual progression to castration-resistant disease

## 23.1.3 Endometrial Cancer

Endometrial cancer demonstrates a strong relationship with estrogen exposure, particularly unopposed estrogen stimulation. On the basis of the concept that frequency of mitotic activity is the primary determinant of endometrial cancer risk and that such activity is controlled by cumulative exposure to unopposed estrogens, one can readily predict the most important risk factors for this disease.

## 23.1.4 Other Hormone-Sensitive Cancers

Additional hormone-sensitive malignancies include:
- Ovarian cancer (estrogen and progesterone sensitive)
- Thyroid cancer (particularly in women)
- Certain sarcomas and bone tumors
