## 23.9.1 Endocrine Resistance in Breast Cancer

Resistance to hormonal therapy can develop through various mechanisms:
- Loss of estrogen receptor expression
- Mutations in estrogen receptor
- Activation of growth factor pathways
- Altered coregulator expression

## 23.9.2 Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer

Eventually, all patients responding to initial androgen deprivation therapy will develop progressive disease as manifested by rising PSA levels, appearance of new lesions on imaging studies, or worsening symptoms.

**Mechanisms of Resistance:**
AR mutations occur in low frequency in primary prostate cancer. In contrast, the cells in the distant metastases and androgen ablation-recurrent prostate cancer often contain AR mutations.

## 23.9.3 Sequential Therapy

ENZ is moderately effective in CRPC patients who were pretreated with chemotherapy and abiraterone acetate. The greater benefit is confined in patients who responded to abiraterone acetate.
