Hormonal therapies represent a cornerstone of cancer treatment for hormone-sensitive malignancies, leveraging the fundamental biological principle that certain cancers depend on hormones for their growth and survival. Neoplasia of hormone-responsive tissues currently accounts for more than 35% of all newly diagnosed male and almost 50% of all newly diagnosed female cancers in the United States. The therapeutic manipulation of hormonal pathways has proven to be one of the most successful targeted approaches in oncology, offering significant benefits in terms of disease control and patient survival.

The underlying mechanism proposed for all of these cancers is that neoplasia is the consequence of prolonged hormonal stimulation of the particular target organ, the normal growth and function of which is controlled by one or more steroid or polypeptide hormones. This understanding forms the basis for hormonal interventions that either block hormone production, prevent hormone-receptor interactions, or disrupt downstream signaling pathways.
