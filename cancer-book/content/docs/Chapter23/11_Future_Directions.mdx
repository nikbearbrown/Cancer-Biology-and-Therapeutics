## 23.10.1 Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs)

The term SARM (= Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator) was introduced in 1999 in analogy of the term SERM (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator).

## 23.10.2 Novel Therapeutic Targets

Emerging targets include:
- Androgen receptor splice variants
- Estrogen receptor mutations
- Downstream signaling pathways
- Epigenetic modifications

## 23.10.3 Combination Strategies

Future research focuses on:
- Combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors
- Immunotherapy combinations
- Targeted therapy combinations
- Personalized medicine approaches
