title: 26.2 Gene Editing Technologies

---



Gene editing represents the next generation of gene therapy, offering unprecedented precision in modifying cellular DNA to correct genetic defects or confer therapeutic properties. Unlike traditional gene therapy that adds genetic material, gene editing directly modifies existing genomic sequences.

## 26.2.1 CRISPR/Cas9 System

**Mechanism of Action**
The CRISPR/Cas9 system is rapidly becoming the tool of choice for gene editing due to its ease of use, flexibility, and versatility. The system consists of:

* **Guide RNA (gRNA)**: A synthetic RNA sequence that directs the Cas9 nuclease to specific genomic locations
* **Cas9 endonuclease**: A programmable nuclease that creates double-strand breaks at target sites
* **Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)**: A short DNA sequence required for Cas9 recognition and binding

**Applications in Cancer Research and Therapy**
CRISPR has been used as a treatment for medical conditions in two ways: ex vivo and in vivo gene editing. Ex vivo gene editing involves harvesting cells from the patient, editing the cells with CRISPR while they are outside of the body, then returning them to the patient through infusion.

*Cancer-Specific Applications*:
* Understanding the genetic mechanisms that underlie cancer development and investigating the functional relevance of potential drug targets in cancer cells
* Creating cancer cell models for drug screening and therapeutic development
* Engineering immune cells to enhance anticancer responses
* Correcting oncogenic mutations in patient-derived cells

**Current Clinical Development**
The first therapeutics based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technologies are entering the market. Exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), sold under the brand name Casgevy, is the first and only CRISPR-based therapy to receive regulatory approval anywhere internationally.

## 26.2.2 Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs) and TALENs

**Zinc Finger Nucleases**
ZFNs represent the first generation of programmable nucleases:
* Consist of engineered zinc finger DNA-binding domains fused to nuclease domains
* Each zinc finger recognizes 3-4 base pairs of DNA
* Multiple zinc fingers can be combined to target longer DNA sequences
* ZFN- and TALEN-based technologies are difficult to engineer, time-consuming, and expensive, limiting their clinical application

**Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs)**
TALENs offer improved specificity over ZFNs:
* Each TALE repeat recognizes a single nucleotide
* More modular and predictable than zinc fingers
* Can target longer DNA sequences with high specificity
* Still require extensive engineering for each target

**Clinical Applications**
Previous technologies using molecules known as zinc finger nucleases and TALENs had made it possible to alter DNA at targeted locations. While these technologies are currently being used in clinical trials, they are cumbersome and difficult to use.

## 26.2.3 Safety Considerations and Off-Target Effects

**Off-Target Cleavage Concerns**
Concerns about the potential risk of unwanted off-target effects have dominated many recent discussions. Most experiments that have detected significant off-targets have been performed in cancer cells, which may have altered DNA repair pathways that could lead to elevated off-target events.

**Risk Mitigation Strategies**
* Improved guide RNA design algorithms to predict and minimize off-target sites
* Use of high-fidelity Cas9 variants with reduced off-target activity
* Delivery optimization to limit exposure time and concentration
* Comprehensive genomic screening for unintended modifications

**Regulatory Considerations**
Despite its capabilities, CRISPR-Cas9 still has deficiencies. It can alter DNA at locations other than the target, which could inactivate essential genes, activate cancer-causing genes, or cause chromosomal rearrangements.
