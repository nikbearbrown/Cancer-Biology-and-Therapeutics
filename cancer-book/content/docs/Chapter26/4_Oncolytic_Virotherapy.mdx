title: 26.4 Oncolytic Virotherapy

---



Oncolytic virotherapy represents a unique approach to cancer treatment that exploits replication-competent viruses engineered to selectively replicate in and destroy cancer cells while sparing normal tissues.

## 26.4.1 Principles of Viral Oncolysis

**Historical Background and Modern Rationale**
The concept of viral oncolysis was introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1904, Dock reported a dramatic remission of leukemia in a woman following a presumed infection by influenza virus. More recently, the replicative life cycle of many viruses has been elucidated at the molecular level, including the sequence of viral genomes and the functions of viral proteins, leading to a more "rational" approach.

**Mechanism of Selective Tumor Targeting**
The use of a replicating virus as an antitumor agent is based on the premise that successful viral replication results in multiple viral progeny being released from destroyed cells to infect surrounding cells. Inoculation of a tumor with a competent virus thus results in death of infected tumor cells as the virus replicates throughout the tumor.

**Exploiting Cellular Defense Defects**
A common theme emerging from studying the interaction of viruses with cells is the presence of viral proteins whose function is to overcome host-cell antiviral defenses. Two examples of cellular antiviral defenses include double-strand RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and the tumor-suppressor protein p53.

## 26.4.2 Engineered Oncolytic Viruses

**Adenovirus-Based Oncolytic Agents**
Because p53 is mutated or deleted in approximately 50% of human tumors, p53-mediated antiviral defense mechanisms are not available to those cells. To exploit this tumor cell phenotype, an adenovirus (dl1520; ONYX-015) with a deletion in the 55-kilodalton E1B gene was created.

*ONYX-015 Mechanism*:
* Replicates preferentially in cells with nonfunctional p53
* dl1520 may be able to preferentially replicate in tumor cells with inactivating mutations in p53 or p14ARF, as well as in cells with activating mutations in Mdm2
* Clinical trials have shown enhanced efficacy when combined with chemotherapy

**Herpes Simplex Virus Oncolytic Agents**
HSV-1 encodes many nonessential gene products that are homologous to cellular proteins preferentially expressed in cycling cells. Examples include thymidine kinase, ribonucleotide reductase, dUTPase, and uracil DNA glycosylase.

*G207 and Other HSV Variants*:
* G207 was generated by deleting the ribonucleotide reductase and γ134.5 genes of HSV-1. With deletions in two genes, this virus has a lower probability of reversion to wild-type phenotype, thereby increasing its safety profile
* The deletion of ribonucleotide reductase targets the virus to cycling cells, and deletion of the γ134.5 gene may target cells with an activated Ras pathway

**Reovirus as a Natural Oncolytic Agent**
Reovirus is a double-stranded RNA virus associated with mild upper respiratory infections or enteritis. The interest in reovirus oncolytic therapy rests in its natural safety profile, with a lack of associated disease pathology upon wild-type reovirus infection.

*Ras-Dependent Replication*:
* The translation of these observations in employing reovirus as an oncolytic virus is coupled with the fact that 30% of human tumors have Ras-activating mutations. Tumors harboring such mutations would be predicted to permit reovirus replication
* Targets gliomas, colorectal, and ovarian cancers with activated Ras pathways

## 26.4.3 Transcriptionally Targeted Oncolytic Viruses

**Tumor-Specific Promoter Control**
Another technique to achieve tumor-specific cytotoxicity with replication-competent viruses is to place expression of viral essential genes under the transcriptional control of tumor-specific promoter/enhancer sequences.

**Examples of Tissue-Specific Targeting**
* To target hepatocellular carcinoma cells, the promoter/enhancer of the α-fetoprotein gene has been placed upstream to the E1 sequences. This virus replicates selectively in hepatocellular carcinoma cells that overexpress α-fetoprotein
* The engineered adenovirus CN706 was constructed by placing the promoter/enhancer region of the PSA gene upstream of the E1A gene. This virus replicates to high titers in prostate cancer cells overexpressing PSA
* To target MUC1-positive tumor cells, the E1A gene has been placed under the control of the DF3/MUC1 promoter/enhancer sequences

## 26.4.4 Safety Considerations and Clinical Applications

**Safety Requirements**
With the use of live, attenuated viruses for cancer therapy, certain safety considerations are warranted. The attenuated virus should be genetically stable such that mutants do not revert to wild-type phenotypes. Engineering multiple mutations into the therapeutic virus can minimize reversion.

**Combination Strategies**
Ionizing radiation enhances the therapeutic potential of both replication-competent adenovirus and HSV-1 in part by increasing the replication potential of the viruses. A variety of chemotherapeutic agents have also been reported to augment the efficacy of replication-conditional adenovirus and HSV-1.
