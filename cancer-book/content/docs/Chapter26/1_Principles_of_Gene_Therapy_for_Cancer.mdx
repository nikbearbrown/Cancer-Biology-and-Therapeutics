title: 26.1 Principles of Gene Therapy for Cancer

---



Gene therapy represents a revolutionary approach to cancer treatment that involves the administration of specific genetic material to modify or manipulate gene expression for therapeutic purposes. According to regulatory definitions, gene therapy involves the administration of specific genetic material (DNA or RNA) via a carrier, known as a "vector," that enables the foreign genetic material to enter target cells. In cancer treatment, gene therapy primarily aims to selectively kill or suppress the growth of malignant cells through various mechanisms.

## 26.1.1 Fundamental Concepts

Gene therapy encompasses several distinct approaches to cancer treatment:

**Gene Replacement Therapy**
* Provides working copies of damaged or deleted tumor suppressor genes
* Restores normal cellular functions disrupted in malignant transformation
* Examples include p53 gene replacement in tumors with p53 mutations

**Gene Addition Therapy**
* Delivers genes encoding prodrug-converting enzymes followed by systemic administration of nontoxic prodrugs, termed "suicide gene therapy"
* Introduces genes encoding cytotoxic proteins directly toxic to cancer cells
* Supplies genes for immunomodulatory molecules to enhance antitumor immunity

**Gene Silencing Therapy**
* Uses antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit oncogene expression, such as targeting c-fos protooncogene to decrease mRNA levels and inhibit growth
* Employs RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress oncogene function
* Blocks expression of genes promoting tumor survival and proliferation

**Immunomodulatory Gene Therapy**
* Delivers genes encoding costimulatory molecules like B7-1 to enhance antitumor immune responses
* Introduces cytokine genes to activate immune effector cells
* Transfers genes for tumor-associated antigens to stimulate immune recognition

## 26.1.2 Therapeutic Mechanisms

Gene therapy for cancer operates through several key mechanisms:

**Suicide Gene Therapy**
This approach exploits the delivery of genes encoding prodrug-converting enzymes to tumor cells, followed by systemic administration of nontoxic prodrugs. Cells transduced to express the prodrug enzyme confer conversion of the prodrug to active metabolites and thereby selective cytotoxicity. The most extensively studied systems include:

* **Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk)/ganciclovir**: HSV-tk phosphorylates ganciclovir to a toxic metabolite that interferes with DNA synthesis
* **Cytosine deaminase/5-fluorocytosine**: Bacterial or yeast cytosine deaminase converts 5-fluorocytosine to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil
* **Purine nucleoside phosphorylase/6-methylpurine deoxyriboside**: Generates toxic purines that disrupt cellular metabolism

**Tumor Suppressor Gene Replacement**
The p53 tumor suppressor is induced in cellular response to genotoxic agents, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and oncogene expression. In the response to DNA damage, p53 activates genes involved in cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, and induction of apoptosis. Replacement of mutated p53 can restore:
* Cell cycle checkpoint control
* DNA damage response mechanisms
* Apoptotic pathways in response to oncogenic stress

**Antisense and RNA Interference**
Gene silencing approaches target overexpressed oncogenes and survival factors:
* Antisense strategies have targeted various oncogenes including myb protooncogene in hematopoietic and melanoma cells, and c-fos in breast carcinoma cells
* siRNA and miRNA approaches can silence multiple oncogenic pathways simultaneously
* Targeting angiogenic factors like VEGF to disrupt tumor vascularization
