title: 26.5 Current Trials and Clinical Use

---



The clinical translation of gene therapy and oncolytic virotherapy has accelerated dramatically in recent years, with multiple products achieving regulatory approval and numerous candidates in advanced clinical development.

## 26.5.1 Approved Gene Therapies

**United States Approvals**
Four gene therapies have received marketing approval in the US: talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic), tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah), axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta), and voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna).

*Talimogene Laherparepvec (Imlygic)*:
* Granted conditional approval by the FDA in October 2015 for treatment of patients with subcutaneous or lymph node melanoma that cannot be surgically removed. It consists of recombinant herpesvirus that contains specific deletions allowing the virus to replicate and lyse tumor cells, as well as a gene carrying granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
* First oncolytic virus approved for cancer treatment
* Administered by intratumoral injection

*CAR T-Cell Therapies*:
* Tisagenlecleucel is approved for patients up to 25 years old who have acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is either relapsed or refractory. It consists of autologous T-cells genetically modified using a lentiviral vector to encode an anti-CD19 CAR
* Axicabtagene ciloleucel was approved in October 2017 for treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy

*Gene Replacement Therapy*:
* Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl was granted approval in December 2017 for treatment of patients with progressive vision loss due to confirmed biallelic mutation in the RPE65 gene. It consists of a recombinant AAV2 vector carrying a functional RPE65 gene

**International Approvals**
Additional gene therapies have received marketing authorization elsewhere, including Gencidine and Oncorine approved by the Chinese State Food and Drug Agency in 2003 and 2005 respectively for treatment of squamous cell carcinoma.

## 26.5.2 Gene Therapies in Advanced Development

**Phase III Clinical Trials**
Fourteen gene therapies are in advanced development, either with current phase III trials or with completed phase II trials with special regulatory designations and plans to initiate phase III trials.

*Ophthalmologic Applications*:
* GS010 for treatment of patients with vision loss from Leber hereditary optical neuropathy involving the ND4 gene consists of an AAV9 vector carrying a functional copy of ND4
* NSR-REP1 for treatment of patients with vision loss due to choroideremia consists of an AAV2 vector carrying human REP1

*Bleeding Disorders*:
* Valoctocogene roxaparvovec for treatment of patients with hemophilia A consists of an AAV vector carrying a functional coagulation factor VIII gene
* AMT-061 for treatment of patients with hereditary hemophilia B consists of an AAV5 vector carrying a functional gene for coagulation factor XI

*Neurological Disorders*:
* AVXS-101 for treatment of children with spinal muscular atrophy Type I consists of a recombinant AAV9 virus carrying a functional copy of the SMN1 gene

## 26.5.3 CRISPR-Based Clinical Trials

**Current Clinical Applications**
As of 2017, there were 18 gene editing-based technologies being tested in clinical trials, most in phase I trials. No clinical trials using gene editing-based technologies have progressed beyond phase II.

*Cancer Applications*:
* CRISPR/Cas9-based technology is currently ongoing in early stages of clinical trials in China. In one ongoing phase II trial, PD-1 knockout T-cells created using CRISPR/Cas9 technology ex vivo are used to treat advanced esophageal cancer
* CRISPR/Cas9-mediated PD-1 knockout Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T-cells are tested in phase I/II for treatment of EBV-positive advanced stage malignancies

## 26.5.4 Economic and Implementation Considerations

**Cost of Gene Therapies**
Gene therapies approved to date have been expensive, with costs ranging from US$65,000 to greater than US$1 million.

*Specific Examples*:
* Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl has a list price of US$425,000 per eye treatment
* Tisagenlecleucel has a list price of US$475,000, but estimates are up to US$750,000
* Axicabtagene ciloleucel has a list price of US$373,000

**Implementation Challenges**
Gene therapies often require specialized manufacturing facilities, care centers, and clinicians trained to conduct customized procedures. Administration may require specialized surgical intervention, and gene therapy recipients often require supportive care in case of adverse events.

*Infrastructure Requirements*:
* Specialized manufacturing for patient-specific therapies
* Advanced clinical centers with appropriate expertise
* Long-term monitoring and follow-up systems
* Reimbursement frameworks for high-cost, one-time treatments

## 26.5.5 Future Directions and Emerging Technologies

**Next-Generation Editing Systems**
Newer gene editing systems are even more powerful than the CRISPR-Cas9 system discovered by Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier. Many techniques, including base, prime, and epigenetic editing, may prove useful interventions for a broad range of genetic and acquired diseases.

**Delivery Improvements**
Improved techniques have enhanced the efficiency, precision, and accuracy of the editing process, yet effective delivery and editing remains difficult for many tissues of the body. Further research to diversify and increase the efficiency, specificity, and safety of editing-delivery systems is essential.

**Regulatory Evolution**
Extended long-term follow-up is essential to fully understand the consequences of an edit and to identify any unanticipated effects, should they occur. Regulatory frameworks continue to evolve to address the unique challenges posed by gene editing technologies while ensuring patient safety and therapeutic efficacy.

The field of gene therapy and oncolytic virotherapy continues to advance rapidly, offering new hope for patients with previously untreatable conditions. As these technologies mature, their integration into standard medical practice will require continued advances in delivery systems, safety monitoring, manufacturing capabilities, and healthcare infrastructure. The success of early approved therapies provides a foundation for the next generation of genetic medicines that promise to transform cancer treatment and beyond.
