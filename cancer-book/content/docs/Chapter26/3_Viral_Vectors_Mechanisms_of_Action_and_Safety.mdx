title: 26.3 Viral Vectors - Mechanisms of Action and Safety

---



Viral vectors represent the most efficient and widely used delivery systems for gene therapy, exploiting the natural ability of viruses to enter cells and deliver genetic material to specific cellular compartments.

## 26.3.1 Retroviral Vectors

**Structure and Function**
Retroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that consist of the 5′ and 3′ long-terminal repeats (LTRs) and the gag, pol, and env structural genes. Gag encodes three proteins that form the shell of the virion. Pol encodes reverse transcriptase, integrase, and ribonuclease H, which are necessary for viral integration into host chromosomal DNA.

**Advantages of Retroviral Vectors**
* Retroviruses integrate into target cell DNA and thus achieve stable integration of the transgene. Theoretically, stable integration should provide long-term expression
* Capable of transducing a wide variety of human cell types
* Replication-deficient vectors provide safety advantages
* Well-characterized manufacturing and production systems

**Limitations and Safety Concerns**
* An important limitation of Mo-MuLV-based retroviral vectors is that they integrate only into actively dividing cells. As most solid tumors have low growth fractions, it is unlikely that these retroviral vectors would transduce a significant proportion of the tumor
* Retroviral-vector-mediated insertional mutagenesis could result in transformation of the transduced target cell, as demonstrated in nonhuman primates that developed hematologic malignancies following treatment with high doses of retroviral vectors containing replication-competent helper viruses
* Expression is not maintained indefinitely; retroviral promoters have a tendency to become inactivated over time

## 26.3.2 Adenoviral Vectors

**Vector Design and Characteristics**
Adenoviruses are nonenveloped, linear, double-stranded DNA viruses. The prototype adenoviral vector for gene therapy is based on adenovirus type 5 (Ad5). Adenoviral vectors have been based on the observation that deletion of the E1A and part of the E1B gene results in replication-deficient viruses.

**Advantages**
* Most human cell types are susceptible to adenoviral infection and are subject to efficient transduction. Additionally, adenoviruses can deliver transgenes to both dividing and nondividing cells
* High-titer vector production (10¹¹ to 10¹² PFU/mL)
* Because adenoviral DNA is episomal, insertional mutagenesis is much less of a concern than it is for retroviral vectors
* Large cloning capacity (up to 8.5 kb of foreign DNA)

**Disadvantages and Immunogenicity**
* A major disadvantage of current adenoviral vectors is the induction of a significant host immune response. A T-cell-mediated response against adenoviral proteins causes a local inflammatory reaction that can result in lysis of the transduced cells and a shorter duration of transgene expression
* Development of neutralizing antibodies limits repeated administration
* As most humans have been exposed to wild-type adenovirus and harbor neutralizing antibodies, these vectors may be quickly cleared when administered in clinical trials

## 26.3.3 Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) Vectors

**Vector Properties**
Adeno-associated viruses are small, nonenveloped, linear single-stranded DNA parvoviruses that are naturally replication deficient. AAV-2 is the predominant serotype used in gene therapy approaches.

**Advantages of AAV Vectors**
* rAAVs are naturally replication defective and are considered nonpathogenic. Also, deletion of the Rep and Cap ORFs, and thereby expression of viral proteins, decreases immunogenicity
* rAAVs have a broad tissue tropism as a consequence of attachment of AAV-2 to the ubiquitously expressed cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan
* Unlike retroviruses, rAAVs transduce both replicating and nonreplicating cells
* Potential for site-specific integration into chromosome 19

**Limitations**
* rAAV can accommodate only 4 kb of DNA insert
* Deletion of the Rep ORF abolishes the site-specific integration of AAV into chromosome 19
* Pre-existing immunity in human populations may limit efficacy

## 26.3.4 Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Vectors

**Vector Design**
HSV-1 is a herpes virus that is naturally neurotropic and also infects epithelial cells. The HSV-1 genome is approximately 150 kb and encodes about 90 proteins.

**Helper-Dependent and Independent Systems**
* Helper virus-dependent vectors have also been termed amplicons. Amplicons are defective HSV genomes that arise spontaneously by recombination and are amplified by serial passage at high multiplicities of infection
* Helper virus-independent HSV-1 viral vectors have deletions in essential viral genes. These HSV-1 vectors replicate to high titers and can insert up to 40 kb of foreign DNA

**Safety Considerations**
* Potential for recombination and reversion to wild-type phenotype
* Wild-type HSV-1 infection is associated with neurologic sequelae, making recombination a concern in using helper-virus-independent HSV-1-based vectors
* Requires complementing cell lines for propagation
