### 5.5.1 Oncogenes as Drug Targets

The discovery that many oncogenes encode altered protein kinases has led to the development of targeted therapies. Protein kinases can be specifically involved in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation and mutations may lead to unregulated growth and proliferation that is typical of cancerous cells. These mutated protein kinases represent an attractive target for anticancer agents.

**Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors**

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are a group of pharmacologic agents that disrupt the signal transduction pathways of protein kinases by several modes of inhibition. Interest in protein kinase inhibitors began with the FDA approval of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib in 2001. Since the introduction of Imatinib, the application of TKIs has been ever-expanding, particularly for cancer treatment.

The potent activity and lack of generalized toxicity of the kinase inhibitors relate to the specificity of antagonist for the mutated protein. The protein kinase inhibitors represent a major advance in cancer chemotherapy, away from broadly cytotoxic agents and towards drugs that specifically target the molecular abnormalities of cancer cells.

### 5.5.2 Resistance Mechanisms

Despite their effectiveness, targeted therapies face challenges from resistance mechanisms:

- Patients require monitoring for disease progression after the initial benefit, which could be a sign of acquired resistance
- Genetic testing to identify known resistance mutations can help guide genotype-directed therapy
- The toxicity and efficacy of TKIs are often closely linked; this allows on-target toxic effects to act as biomarkers of effective pharmacological inhibition

### 5.5.3 Future Directions

The continuing identification of new oncogenes and their mechanisms of activation provides opportunities for developing additional targeted therapies. Usually, a single oncogene is not enough to turn a normal cell into a cancer cell, and many mutations in a number of different genes may be required to make a cell cancerous. Understanding oncogene cooperation and the networks they participate in will be crucial for developing more effective combination therapies.
