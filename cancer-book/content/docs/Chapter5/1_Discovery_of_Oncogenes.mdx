title: 5.1 Discovery of Oncogenes

---


The discovery of oncogenes represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in cancer biology, transforming our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer. This conceptual revolution began with research on tumor viruses and eventually led to the identification of human genes capable of driving malignant transformation when altered.

## 5.1.1 Viral Oncogenes and Retroviral Discoveries

The study of oncogenes originated from investigations into tumor-causing viruses, particularly retroviruses, which laid much of the foundation for our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor induction.

**Peyton Rous and Early Virus Discovery**

Retroviruses were first discovered in association with cancer around the turn of the 20th century. An avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) was isolated from a spontaneous erythroleukemia in a chicken in 1908, and soon after, Peyton Rous isolated Rous sarcoma virus from a chicken fibrosarcoma in 1911. These experiments demonstrated that a submicroscopic agent could cause cancer, though this concept remained controversial for decades.

**Retroviral Life Cycle and Transformation**

The first oncogenes were discovered through the study of retroviruses, RNA tumor viruses whose genomes are reverse-transcribed into DNA in infected animal cells. During the course of infection, retroviral DNA is inserted into the chromosomes of host cells. The integrated retroviral DNA, called the provirus, replicates along with the cellular DNA of the host. Transcription of the DNA provirus leads to the production of viral progeny that bud through the host cell membrane to infect other cells.

Two categories of retroviruses are classified by their time course of tumor formation in experimental animals:

- **Acutely transforming retroviruses**: Can rapidly cause tumors within days after injection and can transform cell cultures to the neoplastic phenotype
- **Chronic or weakly oncogenic retroviruses**: Cause tissue-specific tumors in susceptible strains of experimental animals after a latency period of many months

## 5.1.2 Discovery of Viral Oncogenes and Proto-oncogenes

**First Viral Oncogenes**

Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) was the first acutely transforming virus shown to have acquired its oncogenicity by the capture of a cellular gene, in this case one called src. RSV was perhaps unusual because, unlike most acutely transforming retroviruses, it retained the ability to replicate.

A more typical acutely transforming oncogene-containing retrovirus is typified by Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV). Infection resulted in the replacement of most of the viral genes with a modified copy of the protooncogene c-abl, a tyrosine kinase. Like most viral oncogenes and their cellular counterparts, the abl portion of v-abl differs genetically from c-abl.

**Discovery of Cellular Origins**

The truly revolutionary insight came when it was discovered that viral oncogenes had cellular counterparts in normal DNA. Studies revealed that v-src was not truly a viral gene but rather a captured and altered version of a normal cellular gene (c-src or cellular src). This paradigm-shifting discovery revealed that:

1. Cancer-causing genes were present in the normal cellular genome
2. These normal cellular genes (proto-oncogenes) could be activated or altered to become oncogenes
3. Retroviruses could capture these cellular genes during infection and incorporate them into their genomes

**Retroviral Transduction Process**

Retroviral oncogenes are altered versions of host cellular protooncogenes that have been incorporated into the retroviral genome by recombination with host DNA, a process known as retroviral transduction. Acutely transforming viruses usually are generated when a cellular protooncogene is captured by insertion into the viral genome during viral replication. This process usually causes genetic changes in the protooncogene, resulting in an oncogene, or dominant transforming gene.

## 5.1.3 Mechanisms of Proto-oncogene Activation

**Insertional Mutagenesis**

In contrast to acutely transforming retroviruses, weakly oncogenic retroviruses do not carry viral oncogenes. These retroviruses induce tumors by a process called insertional mutagenesis. This process results from integration of the DNA provirus into the host genome in infected cells. In rare cells, the provirus inserts near a protooncogene. Expression of the protooncogene is then abnormally driven by the transcriptional regulatory elements contained within the long terminal repeats of the provirus.

Insertion of a provirus in the vicinity of a proto-oncogene disrupts the normal organization of the locus and also introduces strong promoter and enhancer regions into the locus. The relationship of the viral and cellular sequences is usually quite flexible. Insertions can occur over a broad range upstream or downstream from many targeted loci, and the proviruses can be in the same transcriptional orientation as the gene or in the opposite orientation.

**Structural Alterations in Viral Oncogenes**

An oncogene incorporated into a retroviral genome differs in several respects from the corresponding proto-oncogene:

- The viral oncogene is transcribed under the control of viral promoter and enhancer sequences, rather than being controlled by the normal transcriptional regulatory sequences
- Oncogenes are usually expressed at much higher levels than the proto-oncogenes and are sometimes transcribed in inappropriate cell types
- Oncogenes frequently encode proteins that differ in structure and function from those encoded by their normal homologs

Many oncogenes are expressed as fusion proteins with viral sequences. Recombination events leading to the generation of such fusion proteins often occur during the capture of proto-oncogenes by retroviruses, and sequences from both the amino and carboxy termini of proto-oncogenes are frequently deleted during the process. Such deletions may result in the loss of regulatory domains that control the activity of the proto-oncogene proteins, thereby generating oncogene proteins that function in an unregulated manner.

## 5.1.4 From Viral Studies to Human Cancer

**Chromosomal Translocations as Guides**

Chromosomal translocations have served as guideposts for the discovery of many new oncogenes. The first consistent karyotypic abnormality identified in a human neoplasm was a characteristic small chromosome in the cells of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Later identified as a derivative of chromosome 22, this abnormality was designated the Philadelphia chromosome, after its city of discovery.

A proto-oncogene on chromosome 9, c-abl, the precursor to the viral oncogene in a mouse leukemia virus, was always found at the junction point in the Philadelphia chromosome, joined to another gene from chromosome 22. The abl protein made from the translocated gene in the Philadelphia chromosome was a fusion protein, encoded mostly by c-abl and partly by the adjacent gene brought in from chromosome 22.

**Human Oncogene Identification**

The first direct identification of an oncogenic mutation in a human cancer came from DNA transfection experiments. Several overactive growth-promoting genes were identified by isolating and sequencing the DNA fragments that had been transferred to transformed cells. The first of these genes to be sequenced was a mutant version of the Ras gene, which is now known to be mutated in about one in four human tumors.
