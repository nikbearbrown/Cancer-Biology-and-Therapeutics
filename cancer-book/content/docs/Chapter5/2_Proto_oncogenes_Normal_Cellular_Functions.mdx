title: 5.2 Proto oncogenes - Normal Cellular Functions
---


Proto-oncogenes encode proteins with essential roles in normal cellular processes, particularly those involved in growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Understanding proto-oncogenes provides critical insights into both normal cellular processes and the mechanisms of oncogenic transformation.

## 5.2.1 Cellular Functions of Proto-oncogenes

Proto-oncogenes play crucial roles in normal cell physiology and are involved in practically every type of molecule involved in cell signaling—secreted proteins, transmembrane receptors, GTP-binding proteins, protein kinases, gene regulatory proteins, and so on.

**Signal Transduction Components**

The majority of oncogene proteins function as elements of the signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival in response to growth factor stimulation. These oncogene proteins include:

- **Polypeptide growth factors**: That promote cell proliferation
- **Growth factor receptors**: Particularly receptor tyrosine kinases
- **Elements of intracellular signaling pathways**: Including protein kinases and GTP-binding proteins
- **Transcription factors**: That regulate gene expression

**Cell Cycle and Growth Control**

Proto-oncogenes are critical components of the pathways that regulate the social behavior of cells in the body—in particular, the mechanisms by which signals from a cell's neighbors can impel it to divide, differentiate, or die. Many cancer mutations alter signal pathway components in a way that causes them to deliver proliferative signals even when more cells are not needed, switching on cell growth, DNA replication, and cell division inappropriately.

## 5.2.2 Major Proto-oncogene Families

**Growth Factor Receptors**

A large group of oncogenes encode growth factor receptors, most of which are protein-tyrosine kinases. These receptors are frequently converted to oncogene proteins by alterations of their amino-terminal domains, which would normally bind extracellular growth factors. The action of growth factors as oncogene proteins results from their abnormal expression, leading to a situation in which a tumor cell produces a growth factor to which it also responds. The result is autocrine stimulation of the growth factor-producing cell, which drives abnormal cell proliferation.

**Signal Transduction Molecules**

Many proto-oncogenes encode intracellular signaling proteins that relay messages from growth factor receptors to the cell's nucleus. These include:

- Small GTP-binding proteins like Ras
- Protein kinases that phosphorylate other proteins
- Adaptor proteins that facilitate protein-protein interactions

**Transcriptional Regulators**

Some proto-oncogenes encode transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. When these become oncogenes, they can inappropriately activate or repress target genes.

## 5.2.3 Normal Regulation of Proto-oncogenes

Proto-oncogenes are tightly regulated under normal conditions through multiple mechanisms to ensure that cell proliferation occurs only when appropriate. This regulation includes:

- **Transcriptional control**: Regulating when and where proto-oncogenes are expressed
- **Post-translational modifications**: Controlling protein activity through phosphorylation and other modifications
- **Protein-protein interactions**: Modulating activity through binding partners
- **Subcellular localization**: Controlling where proteins function within the cell
