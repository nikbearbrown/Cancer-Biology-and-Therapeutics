## 5.4.1 RAS Family Oncogenes

Ras proteins are a major point of convergence in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling and are an important component of the cellular machinery necessary to transduce extracellular signals. Ras small GTP-binding proteins are membrane-bound intracellular signaling molecules that mediate a wide variety of cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

**Normal RAS Function**

Ras is one such oncogene product that helps to relay signals by acting as a switch. When receptors on the cell surface are stimulated (by a hormone, for example), Ras is switched on and transduces signals that tell the cell to grow. If the cell-surface receptor is not stimulated, Ras is not activated and so the pathway that results in cell growth is not initiated.

Ras helps to broadcast signals from the cell surface to other parts of the cell. It is often required when receptor tyrosine kinases signal to the nucleus to stimulate cell proliferation or differentiation by altering gene expression. The Ras proteins play a key role in mitogenic signaling by coupling growth factor receptors to activation of the Raf protein-serine/threonine kinase, which initiates a protein kinase cascade.

**RAS in Cancer**

In about 30% of human cancers, Ras is mutated so that it is permanently switched on, telling the cell to grow regardless of whether receptors on the cell surface are activated or not. Ras was first discovered as the hyperactive product of a mutant ras gene that promoted the development of cancer; we now know that about 30% of human tumors have a hyperactive ras mutation.

## 5.4.2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinases

Growth factors and their respective receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play pivotal roles in normal cellular functions, such as proliferation and motility, as well as in pathogenesis, including cancer.

**RTK Structure and Function**

The human genome has more than 500 protein kinases and they can be classified as (1) tyrosine, (2) serine-threonine or (3) nonspecific (both), based upon their amino acid specificity. Many protein kinases are cell surface receptors and act to initiate an intracellular pathway of activation, after the receptor is engaged by its ligand, typically a cytokine or growth factor.

The most characterized signaling pathways induced upon activation of RTKs, including members of EGFR family (ErbB/HER), are the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras-MAPK), the phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-PKB/Akt), and the phospholipase C-protein kinase C (PLC-PKC) pathways.

**RTK Oncogenes**

These receptors are frequently converted to oncogene proteins by alterations that result in constitutive activation. For example:

- The Tel sequences of Tel/PDGFR fusion protein dimerize in the absence of growth factor binding, resulting in constitutive activity of the intracellular kinase domain
- Genes that encode some receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, such as erbB-2, are activated by gene amplification
- Most commonly, v-onc genes that encode receptor PTKs have lost the sequences that encode some or all of the ligand-binding region of the proteins, rendering the kinases constitutively active

## 5.4.3 Non-Receptor Tyrosine Kinases

Other oncogenes encode nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases that are constitutively activated by deletions or mutations of regulatory sequences.

**ABL Family**

The abl oncogene exemplifies non-receptor tyrosine kinases. In normal cells, c-Abl is tightly regulated, but in the BCR-ABL fusion protein found in chronic myeloid leukemia, this regulation is lost, leading to constitutive kinase activity. The initial tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for use was imatinib (Gleevec: 2001) which is used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has a mutated kinase receptor (BCR-ABL) created by the specific translocation.

## 5.4.4 Transcription Factor Oncogenes

**MYC Family**

Proto-oncogenes called Harvey-Ras (H-ras) and Kirsten-Ras (K-ras) are the progenitors of viral oncogenes found in mouse and rat sarcoma viruses. The MYC family represents another major class of oncogenes that function as transcription factors, regulating the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, metabolism, and growth.

**Activation Mechanisms**

In another childhood tumor, called neuroblastoma, a different member of the myc gene family was often reduplicated ("amplified"), so that many copies of the gene and dangerously large amounts of myc protein were made in the cancer cells.
