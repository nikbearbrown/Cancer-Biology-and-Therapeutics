title: 5.3 Mechanisms of Oncogene Activation
---


The activation of oncogenes involves genetic changes to cellular protooncogenes. The consequence of these genetic alterations is to confer a growth advantage to the cell. Three genetic mechanisms activate oncogenes in human neoplasms: (1) mutation, (2) gene amplification, and (3) chromosome rearrangements.

## 5.3.1 Point Mutations

Point mutations represent a common mechanism of oncogene activation, particularly for genes encoding signaling proteins.

**RAS Mutations**

The major hot spots for activating ras mutations are all located in the regions of the protein that are near the bound guanine nucleotide, particularly in proximity to the nucleotide phosphate groups. Much of the interest in ras stems from the fact that this gene is involved in a high fraction of human cancers. Ras has been shown to be oncogenically activated by mutations in over 15% of all human tumors, and in some cancers, such as pancreatic carcinoma, the frequency is as high as 90%.

The single nucleotide changes that turned a ras proto-oncogene into an oncogene were essentially identical to changes also observed when retroviral ras oncogenes were compared with the proto-oncogenes. The K-ras gene is now known to be mutated in a vast number of human cancers, including a quarter of lung cancers, half of colon cancers, and nearly all pancreatic cancers. In virtually all cases, the responsible mutations consist of no more than a single change affecting one nucleotide in the DNA sequence.

**Other Mutation Examples**

A significant example of activating point mutations is represented by those affecting the ret protooncogene in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A syndrome (MEN2A). Germline point mutations affecting one of the cysteines located in the juxtamembrane domain of the ret receptor have been found to confer an oncogenic potential as a consequence of the ligand-independent activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor.

Davies and colleagues identified B-raf mutations in around 66% of human melanoma cell lines and primary tumors. These mutations were further shown to oncogenically activate B-raf, as determined by NIH3T3 transfection analysis.

## 5.3.2 Gene Amplification

Gene amplification refers to the expansion in copy number of a gene within the genome of a cell. Gene amplification was first discovered as a mechanism by which some tumor cell lines can acquire resistance to growth-inhibiting drugs.

**Common Amplified Oncogenes**

Studies demonstrated that three protooncogene families—myc, erb B, and ras—are amplified in a significant number of human tumors:

- About 20% to 30% of breast and ovarian cancers show c-myc amplification
- N-myc was discovered as a new member of the myc protooncogene family through its amplification in neuroblastomas
- Amplification of N-myc correlates strongly with advanced tumor stage in neuroblastoma, suggesting a role for this gene in tumor progression
- L-myc was discovered through its amplification in small-cell carcinoma of the lung
- Amplification of erb B, the epidermal growth factor receptor, is found in up to 50% of glioblastomas

## 5.3.3 Chromosomal Rearrangements

Chromosomal translocations can create oncogenic fusion proteins or place proto-oncogenes under inappropriate regulatory control.

**Fusion Oncoproteins**

The Philadelphia chromosome exemplifies how chromosomal rearrangements can create oncogenic fusion proteins. The BCR-ABL fusion protein created by the t(9;22) translocation is much more active enzymatically than the normal c-abl protein, driving leukemia development through constitutive tyrosine kinase activity.

**Enhancer Hijacking**

In the human childhood tumor called Burkitt's lymphoma, a myc gene on chromosome eight is joined to other chromosomes in a fashion that places strong signals for gene expression next to the myc gene, enhancing the production of myc RNA and protein. This represents enhancer hijacking, where the oncogene is placed under control of strong transcriptional enhancers.
