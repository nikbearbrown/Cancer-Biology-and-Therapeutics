## 30.1.1 Foundations of Histopathological Classification

**Definition and Principles:**
Histopathological classification represents the traditional cornerstone of cancer diagnosis, based on the microscopic examination of tissue samples to determine cellular morphology, tissue architecture, and differentiation patterns. Cancer grading describes the microscopic appearance of the tumor's cells and tissue. Low-grade tumors have relatively normal-appearing cells and tissue structures. These tumors are considered well-differentiated. Higher-grade tumors have more abnormal-appearing cells and tissue that is structured abnormally.

**Fundamental Features:**
The main histopathological features that classify brain tumors include atypia, anaplasia, microscopic proliferation, and necrosis. These characteristics form the basis for grading systems across different cancer types. Higher-grade tumors are typically more aggressive and have a worse prognosis. They are described as poorly differentiated. The highest-grade tumors are termed undifferentiated.

## 30.1.2 WHO Classification System

**Global Standardization:**
The World Health Organization has classified CNS tumors into seven categories in its most recent revision of its classification system. Primary CNS tumors comprise approximately 50% to 70% of intracranial tumors, with the majority being neuroepithelial tissue tumors. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) published an updated version of the classification of CNS tumors. There has been a significant restructuring in classifying these tumors, and for the first time, molecular features are included in addition to the previously described histopathological features.

**WHO Grading System:**
The WHO grading system provides a standardized approach across different cancer types. For example, in central nervous system tumors:
- **Grade I**: Benign tumors with low proliferative potential and good prognosis following complete surgical excision
- **Grade II**: Low-grade tumors that are generally well-differentiated but may progress to higher grades
- **Grade III**: Anaplastic tumors with increased cellularity, atypia, and mitotic activity
- **Grade IV**: Highly malignant tumors with rapid progression and poor prognosis

## 30.1.3 Tissue-Specific Classification Systems

**Cervical Cancer Classification:**
The histologic classification of epithelial tumors of the uterine cervix by the World Health Organization (WHO) separates them into three main groups: squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and other epithelial tumors. The majority of cervical carcinomas are squamous cell carcinomas that are classified as either large cell nonkeratinizing or large cell keratinizing.

**Prostate Cancer Grading:**
The Gleason score is the primary initial histologic assessment tool used to grade prostate malignancies and has proven to have significant prognostic value. The Gleason grade is primarily based on the architecture or arrangement of the malignant cells within the tumor as well as other factors such as the degree of differentiation. Since the prostate is a gland, the less glandular the microscopic appearance, the higher the Gleason grade, ranging from 1 to a maximum of 5.

## 30.1.4 Differentiation Assessment

**Cellular Differentiation Concepts:**
Differentiation refers to how closely cancer cells resemble normal cells of the same tissue type. Well-differentiated tumors closely resemble normal tissue architecture and cellular morphology, while poorly differentiated tumors show significant deviation from normal patterns. Cancer cells are usually less developed (differentiated) than healthy cells, and not specialized for a specific task.

**Grading Systems:**
Grading is done to assess how much the tumor cells differ from healthy cells. In many cases, the less differentiated tumor cells are, the faster they grow and the earlier they spread to surrounding tissue. Tumors are graded using the abbreviations G1 to G4: the higher the grade, the less differentiated and the more malignant the tumor is.

## 30.1.5 Specialized Grading Systems

**FNCLCC System:**
The French Federation of Cancer Centers (FNCLCC) grading system is widely used for soft tissue sarcomas. This system evaluates three parameters:
- Tumor differentiation
- Mitotic count
- Necrosis extent

Each parameter is scored, and the total score determines the histologic grade (G1, G2, or G3).

**Ki-67 Proliferation Index:**
An indicator of mitotic activity, the Ki-67 labeling index, is usually below 10% for low-grade gliomas. Histologically, low-grade tumors are well-differentiated and demonstrate hypercellular glia with nuclear atypia and rare mitotic activity. This proliferation marker has become increasingly important across multiple cancer types for determining growth potential and prognosis.

## 30.1.6 Morphological Patterns and Architectural Features

**Glandular Architecture:**
In adenocarcinomas, the degree of glandular formation is a key grading criterion. Well-differentiated adenocarcinomas maintain recognizable glandular patterns, while poorly differentiated tumors lose this architecture and may appear as solid sheets of cells.

**Squamous Differentiation:**
For squamous cell carcinomas, keratinization and the presence of intercellular bridges are important differentiation markers. Keratinizing carcinoma is characterized by cells with very hyperchromatic nuclei and densely eosinophilic cytoplasm growing in irregular invasive nests. Many of these nests have central "pearls" that contain abundant keratin.

## 30.1.7 Limitations and Challenges

**Inter-observer Variability:**
Despite these advances and guidelines, there remains a considerable difference in Gleason grading, even between experienced pathologists. Studies have further demonstrated considerable variation between pathologists in colorectal cancer grading, suggesting the importance of tumor staging for prognosis.

**Diagnostic Challenges:**
It is becoming evident that histopathologic diagnosis is insufficient to accurately predict tumor behavior and prognosis, particularly with the problem of interobserver variability with respect to histopathologic grade. This recognition has driven the integration of molecular features into modern classification systems.
