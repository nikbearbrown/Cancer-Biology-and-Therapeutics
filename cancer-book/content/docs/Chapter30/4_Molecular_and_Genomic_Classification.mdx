title: 30.3 Molecular and Genomic Classification

## 30.3.1 Evolution Toward Molecular Classification

**Paradigm Shift:**
The advent of the age of genomics analyses has dramatically accelerated the pace of discovery and characterization of susceptibility to cancer and of the hallmarks of the genomic changes that cancer cells undergo, both as consequential events and as a result of the genomic changes in the cancer cells. This has led to molecular-based tumor classification becoming increasingly important in clinical practice.

**Integration with Traditional Systems:**
Studies to determine histological classification and immunohistochemical staining should be performed using the endometrial tissue specimens obtained. In addition to these traditional testing methods, FIGO guidelines state molecular subtyping is encouraged and should be used, if known, to upstage or downstage stage 1 and 2 cancers, depending on the molecular classification.

## 30.3.2 Gene Expression Profiling

**Microarray Technology:**
Microarray analysis has proven to be a powerful method for the analysis of gene expression patterns in human cancer and for cancer classification. It is becoming increasingly clear that while some tumors appear to be caused by mutations in a single gene, most cancers likely arise through the collaboration of multiple genes, none of which, when considered alone, are sufficient for transformation.

**Classification Approaches:**
Gene expression profiling provides the potential to gain a deeper understanding of the complex biological and molecular basis of lymphomas, facilitating discovery of new drug targets and new therapeutic approaches. Supervised methods of analysis are used predominantly to identify the differences at molecular level between known classes (Class Comparison) and to diagnose or "predict" to which class a new tumor sample belongs (Class Prediction).

## 30.3.3 Molecular Subtypes in Specific Cancers

**Breast Cancer Molecular Classification:**
MammaPrint is the first assay based on microarrays that has completed the path from the bench to FDA approval for clinical application. Gene expression may reflect fundamental biological tumor features, and thus be relatively stable across ethnic groups. However, gene expression patterns have also been associated with specific genetic mutations (i.e., BRCA1).

**Gastrointestinal Cancer Subtypes:**
Four molecular subtypes have been identified in gastric cancer (Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive, microsatellite unstable, genomically stable and chromosomal instability) and colorectal cancer (microsatellite instability, genome stable, chromosomal instability, and hypermutated-single nucleotide variant) through comprehensive molecular profiling using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

## 30.3.4 Genomic Biomarkers and Prognostic Signatures

**Multi-gene Signatures:**
Genomic biomarkers have increasingly been developed and utilized in recent years, to stratify patients and predict clinical outcome, for instance, being used as prognostic and predictive biomarkers in various types of cancers. Such genomic assays on predicting clinical outcome may aid physicians in determining a most suitable clinical therapy for the patient.

**Clinical Implementation:**
We identified and validated a novel 53–gene prognostic signature and score system that robustly and reliably predicts overall survival in gastric cancer patients. We also discovered that the predictive potential of the 53-gene signature that can identify gastric cancer patients who may benefit from adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy.

## 30.3.5 Tumor Mutational Burden and Microsatellite Instability

**Mutational Landscape:**
A new type of test that is available for clinical testing is tumor mutational burden (TMB)—a genomic biomarker for cancer immunotherapy that measures the number of mutations in a tumor's genome. Because cancer is a disease that alters the genome, mutational events can range in size from a single nucleotide to an entire chromosome.

**Microsatellite Instability:**
This test analyzes 324 genes and can be used for any tumor; it detects four genomic alterations (base pair substitutions, insertions and deletions, copy number alterations, and rearrangements), tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability.

## 30.3.6 Companion Diagnostics and Precision Medicine

**FDA-Approved Molecular Tests:**
The approval was somewhat different from the other diagnostic tests, because it is a companion diagnostic (CDx) used to predict and inform therapy decisions. This is the first time there has been an FDA approval of a test that also considers what therapeutic drug can be used based on the patient's test results.

**Future Directions:**
Tumor sequencing will become standard clinical practice; liquid biopsies will become available to sample circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); tumor classification will become molecular-based, and tumor-agnostic biomarker strategies may be used to manage patients; and clinical trials in oncology will use sequencing at both enrollment and follow-up.

## 30.3.7 Molecular Classification in Specific Tumor Types

**Endometrial Cancer:**
If available, molecular studies for endometrial cancer classification have become preferable to histologic testing, which is less accurate and more difficult to duplicate. The revised FIGO staging system markedly clarified tumor characteristics for each stage and incorporated molecular analysis data from the Cancer Genome Atlas, which are correlated with prognosis and treatment planning.

**Endometrial Cancer Molecular Subtypes:**
- **POLEmut**: DNA polymerase epsilon mutated tumors with excellent prognosis
- **MMRd**: Mismatch repair deficient tumors with intermediate prognosis
- **NSMP**: No specific molecular profile tumors with intermediate prognosis
- **p53abn**: p53 abnormal tumors with poor prognosis

**Urothelial Carcinoma:**
Multiple classification systems exist for categorizing muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma. Most rely on multi-platform molecular classification techniques such as transcriptomic analysis. High grade muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma can be broadly categorized as "luminal type", "basal type" and "other". The luminal and basal types have different clinical outcomes with differential responses to various systemic therapies.

## 30.3.8 Integration of Classification Systems

**Multi-platform Approach:**
Increasingly, it is recognized that certain subtypes impact patient prognosis and outcome hence the need to correctly recognize and document their presence. Certain subtypes and divergent features correlate with the emerging molecular bladder cancer subtypes, which can also influence patient management decisions.

**Clinical Decision-Making:**
Urothelial carcinoma subtypes and divergent differentiation impact patient outcome and their presence needs to be recognized and documented by the reporting pathologist. Recognition of these entities guide patient counselling and enable prognostic stratification.

## 30.3.9 Challenges and Future Directions

**Technical Considerations:**
It is unknown whether gene expression profiles are more or less likely than more traditional biomarkers to be generalizable beyond the populations in which they were initially developed. This speaks to the importance of validating these tests in populations with varying genetic background.

**Standardization Needs:**
Biological and genetic evidence potentially addressing these issues is expected to become available in the form of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays coupled to expression arrays. This will require continued development of standardized protocols and quality control measures.
