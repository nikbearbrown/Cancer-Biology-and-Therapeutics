title: 14.2 Interaction between Cancer Cells and the Stroma
---


The relationship between cancer cells and stromal components is bidirectional and dynamic, with both compartments influencing each other's behavior and function through complex molecular crosstalk.


## 14.2.1 Bidirectional Signaling Mechanisms

Accumulating evidence indicates that the epithelial and stromal compartments interact to enhance the aggressive nature of this disease. Pancreatic cancer cells release various factors that stimulate the stroma. Stromal cells, in turn, release mitogenic substances that stimulate tumor growth, invasion, and resistance to therapy.

**Cancer Cell-Derived Factors**

Stroma production is stimulated by cancer-cell derived growth factors including transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF).

Recent studies have demonstrated that Shh exerts its effect principally through a paracrine pathway in PDAC. These experiments have shown that Shh produced by tumor cells plays a key role in the recruitment and maintenance of the tumor mesenchyme.

**Stromal Cell-Derived Factors**

Global gene expression analysis of genes differentially expressed in fibroblasts cultured in the absence or presence of pancreatic cancer cell lines revealed 43 up-regulated and 31 down-regulated transcripts. Among the most highly up-regulated genes were members of the CXC/CC chemokine family including MCP-1 (CCL2), interleukin-(IL)-8 (CXCL8), GRO1 (CXCL1), and GRO2 (CXCL2); all of which have been implicated in tumor invasion and angiogenesis.

## 14.2.2 Metabolic Crosstalk

The metabolic interaction between cancer cells and stromal components represents a crucial aspect of tumor-stroma relationships, with important implications for tumor growth and therapeutic resistance.

**The Reverse Warburg Effect**

Cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo the reverse Warburg effect and provide cancer cells with glycolytic metabolites. This metabolic reprogramming allows for efficient energy utilization within the tumor microenvironment.

CAF-derived lactate is crucial in prostate cancer metabolic transformation towards OXPHOS. CAFs can transfer functional mitochondria to prostate cancer cells.




**Amino Acid and Lipid Metabolism**

CAFs augment cancer's addiction to glutamine and its metabolically relevant consequences. Alanine secreted by pancreatic stellate cells supports tumor metabolism.

CAFs act as lipid synthesis factories for colorectal cancer cells. Accumulation of fatty acids in the TME could serve as a nutrient reservoir for cancer cell growth during nutrient deprivation.

## 14.2.3 Mechanical Forces and Physical Interactions

The physical properties of the tumor microenvironment, including matrix stiffness, density, and organization, significantly influence cancer cell behavior and therapeutic response.

**Desmoplastic Reaction**

The desmoplastic reaction is composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, primarily type I and III collagen, fibronectin and proteoglycans; small endothelium lined vessels; and a diverse population of cells including inflammatory cells, fibroblasts and stellate cells.

The stroma can form up to 90% of the tumor volume, a property which is unique to pancreatic cancer. This extensive stromal component creates significant physical barriers that can impede therapeutic delivery.

**Matrix Remodeling**

Matrix reorganization occurs through a process of degradation and crosslinking enzymes, produced by fibroblasts, that are activated and regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors.

Transcription growth factor-alpha and beta (TGF-A and TGF-B), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) all have implications in fibroblast regulation.
