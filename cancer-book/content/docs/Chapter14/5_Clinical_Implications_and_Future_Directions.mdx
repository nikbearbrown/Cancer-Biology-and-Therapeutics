title: Clinical Implications and Future Directions
---


Understanding the tumor microenvironment has profound implications for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Quantification of the immune and inflammatory landscape of the TME has provided novel prognostic indicators of cancer progression, as shown by quantification of tumour-infiltrating T cells and TAMs.

The complexity of the tumor microenvironment necessitates a multi-faceted approach to cancer therapy that targets not only cancer cells but also the supporting stromal components. As we better understand the interactions between the stromal and epithelial cell compartments in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, it is becoming evident that anticancer therapies targeting the stroma, in addition to epithelial cells, may play a key role in improving clinical outcomes for patients with this deadly disease.

Future research directions include developing combination therapies that simultaneously target multiple components of the tumor microenvironment, understanding the temporal dynamics of TME evolution during cancer progression, and identifying biomarkers that predict response to microenvironment-targeted therapies.
