title: 14.3 Inflammation and the Tumor Microenvironment
---


The relationship between inflammation and cancer has been recognized for over a century, with chronic inflammation serving as both a cause and consequence of malignant transformation.

## 14.3.1 Historical Perspective and Epidemiological Evidence

In 1863, Virchow proposed that cancer originates at sites of inflammatory responses. Based on extensive epidemiological studies in the 20th century, the association between persistent infections, inflammation, and the development of human cancers was conclusively established for several types of carcinomas and lymphomas.

## 14.3.2 Inflammatory Pathways in Cancer Development

**Chronic Inflammation and Carcinogenesis**

The pathways that are activated by persistent or repeated episodes of acute inflammation or by chronic inflammation and that contribute to tumour growth, invasion, and metastasis are illustrated. Continued recruitment of host inflammatory cells to the evolving tumour microenvironment in response to persistent infections, ongoing tissue injury, or upregulated production of cytokines and chemokines drives cancer development.

**Inflammatory Mediators**

Activated inflammatory cells, including neutrophils and macrophages, produce reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. These reactive species can cause DNA damage and contribute to genomic instability.

Key cytokines in tumour-associated inflammation are IL-1 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). IL-1 is produced by tumour, endothelial, and inflammatory cells and activates intracellular signalling pathways, including those of NF-κB, activator protein 1 (AP-1), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), that stimulate production of mediators involved in inflammation, invasion, and angiogenesis.

## 14.3.3 Tumor-Promoting Inflammation

**Inflammatory Cell Recruitment**

According to CARR and UNDERWOOD, 1974, tumor cells stimulate the following phenomena: – the lymphoreticular reaction, with the invasion of lymphocytes, macrophages, lymphoreticular cells, immunologically active cells; – the vascular reaction, with the proliferation of endothelial cells and the formation of new capillaries; – the fibrous reaction, with fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition; – the inflammatory reaction, with polymorphonuclear infiltration (neutrophils and eosinophils).

**Pro-tumorigenic Inflammatory Signaling**

TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory mediator produced by activated macrophages and tumour cells, leading to activation of NF-κB and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). IL-6 also promotes tumour angiogenesis and invasion. Constitutive activation of NF-κB and STAT3 is found in several human tumours, and these factors act synergistically to sustain and enhance tumour-associated inflammation.

## 14.3.4 Matrix Metalloproteinases and Tissue Remodeling

Activation of MMPs in the tumour microenvironment promotes tumour cell migration and invasion, release of sequestered growth factors, and activation of latent forms of cytokines including IL-1β.

The T-lymphocyte subset TH17 produces IL-17, which upregulates IL-23 expression in the tumour microenvironment. IL-23 is a key cytokine in tumour growth and invasion; it causes upregulation of MMP-9 expression and increases angiogenesis and fibrosis.
