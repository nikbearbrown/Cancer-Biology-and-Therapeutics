title: 14.1 Components of the Tumor Microenvironment
---


The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex, dynamic ecosystem surrounding malignant cells that plays a crucial role in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. The TME, the environment surrounding the cancer cells, is a heterogeneous mixture of immune cells, endothelial cells, materials secreted from cells and their organelles, and fibroblasts. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex biological structure surrounding tumor cells and includes blood vessels, immune cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and extracellular matrix (ECM).




## 14.1.1 Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent one of the most abundant and functionally important components of the tumor stroma. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a major component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), play an important role in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. Unlike normal fibroblasts, CAFs exhibit markedly different characteristics that promote tumorigenesis.


**Morphological and Functional Characteristics of CAFs**

CAFs, unlike normal fibroblasts (NF), are not passive bystanders. They possess similar characteristics to myofibroblasts, the fibroblasts responsible for wound healing and chronic inflammation, such as the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Fibroblasts stem from a mesenchymal origin and have an elongated spindle or stellate shape with a multitude of cytoplasmic projections. Within the cytoplasm is an abundance of rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) and a large Golgi apparatus.

**Origins and Activation of CAFs**

CAFs can originate from the activation and differentiation of quiescent fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and epithelial and endothelial cells. The transformation from normal fibroblasts to CAFs involves complex molecular programs that reprogram their phenotype and function.

**Metabolic Reprogramming in CAFs**

As cancer progresses, the CAFs also coevolve, transitioning from an inactivated state to an activated state. A critical aspect of CAF activation involves metabolic reprogramming, particularly the phenomenon known as the "reverse Warburg effect."

In the 1920s, Otto Warburg found that cancer cells preferably produce energy by converting glucose to lactic acid, even in aerobic conditions, to generate ATP rapidly. This is known as the Warburg effect. Interestingly, it was suggested that the reverse Warburg effect is the result of fibroblasts secreting lactate/pyruvate and epithelial cancer cells simultaneously taking up the energy-rich metabolites to utilize in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Genetic alterations that result in the deactivation of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression lead to autophagy and aerobic glycolysis in cancer-associated fibroblasts. Subsequently, lactate, glutamine, and other metabolites that fuel biosynthesis are synthesized and exported to initiate oxidative metabolism in neighboring cancer cells.

**Functional Roles of CAFs**

Fibroblasts are the most common cell type represented in connective tissue. These cells produce a diverse group of products including collagen type I, III, and IV, proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminins, glycosaminoglycans, metalloproteinases, and even prostaglandins.

These cells synthesize reorganize the ECM found in the skin, lung, heart, kidney, liver, eye, and other organs. The ECM is in constant communication with the surrounding cells as fibroblasts can secrete and respond to both autocrine and paracrine signals.

## 14.1.2 Immune Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment

The immune system's role in cancer is complex and paradoxical, serving both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting functions depending on the context and activation state of different immune cell populations.

**Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs)**

Inflammatory cells including macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, and eosinophils are present in the TME. Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are prototypic inflammatory cells, playing a key role in the orchestration of the TME.

Mononuclear phagocytes are extremely plastic. In the context of interferon-driven type 1 immune responses, macrophages acquire tumoricidal activity. However, in the tumor microenvironment, macrophages often adopt a phenotype that promotes rather than inhibits tumor growth.

Several studies indicate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) usually have a pro-tumoral action, since they can stimulate angiogenesis, increase tumor cell invasion and motility, and have an immunosuppressive action.


**Macrophage Polarization in the TME**

The phenotype of tumour-associated macrophages is shifted to a pro-fibrotic, pro-angiogenic phenotype, M2, characterized by production of arginase, IL-10, and TGF-β as well as IL-23.

IL-4 and IL-13 produced by Th2 cells or by eosinophils elicit alternative M2 polarization of macrophages, which results in tumour promotion. Evidence suggests that this pathway plays a dominant role in carcinoma of the breast and in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

**T Lymphocytes and Adaptive Immunity**

The immune system's antitumor activity is mainly carried out by tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), T effector (Teff) cells, antibody-producing B cells, as well as antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DC), which lead to adaptive immunity by directly recognizing and eliminating cancer cells.

Whereas a Th1-orchestrated cytotoxic T-cell-mediated response has a protective function, Th2-polarized T cells and Th17 cells trigger tumour-promoting cascades.

**Immunosuppressive Mechanisms**

Even though this defense system is well developed, the tumor often has the ability to develop an immunosuppressive microenvironment favorable to its progression. Specifically, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), regulatory T (Treg) cells, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are well-known players.

Tumour progression and escape are associated with immunosuppressive pathways in innate and adaptive anti-tumour responses, which include, among others, suppressive myeloid cells, activation of checkpoint blockade, and induction and recruitment of Treg cells.

## 14.1.3 Endothelial Cells and Angiogenesis

Endothelial cells form the inner lining of blood vessels and play a crucial role in tumor angiogenesis—the formation of new blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen to growing tumors.

**Tumor Angiogenesis Mechanisms**

Angiogenesis, the growth of new capillary blood vessels, is central to the growth of cancer. Because the oxygen diffusion distance is 100 to 200 microns, tumor cells that exceed these distances from a capillary vessel become anoxic.

Vascular casts of metastases in the rabbit liver reveal that tumors of up to 1 mm in diameter are usually avascular, but beyond that size are vascularized. This size limitation necessitates the "angiogenic switch" for continued tumor growth.




**Angiogenic Factors and Signaling**

VEGF-A expression is greatly stimulated by tissue hypoxia and, perhaps independently, by low tissue pH, conditions that are commonly present in the tumor microenvironment.

VEGF-A action induces endothelial cells to express increased amounts of tissue factor, urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteases. Collectively, these endothelial cell products induce clotting and initiate fibrinolysis and degradation of collagen and other elements of preexisting matrix, all-important steps in angiogenesis and stroma generation.

**Tumor Vasculature Characteristics**

A microscopic population of angiogenic tumor cells will begin to modify microvessels in the neighborhood by inducing an increase in vascular permeability, dilation, and tortuosity even before the induction of new vascular sprouts.
