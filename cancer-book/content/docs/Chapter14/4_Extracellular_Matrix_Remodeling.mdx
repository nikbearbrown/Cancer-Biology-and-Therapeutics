title: 14.4 Extracellular Matrix Remodeling

The extracellular matrix (ECM) serves as more than just a structural scaffold in the tumor microenvironment; it actively participates in tumor progression through dynamic remodeling processes that influence cancer cell behavior.




## 14.4.1 ECM Composition and Organization

**Normal vs. Tumor ECM**

The tumor microenvironment is composed of cellular components, bioactive substances, and extracellular matrix comprising of proteins such as collagens, proteoglycans, and the linear glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan.

For the most part, tumor stroma is formed by elements that are derived from the circulating blood and from adjacent host connective tissues. Generally speaking, the major components of tumor stroma include, in addition to new blood vessels, leaked plasma and plasma proteins; proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans; interstitial collagens (primarily types I and III); fibrin; fibronectin; and cells of two general types, normal connective tissue cells such as fibroblasts and inflammatory cells that are derived from the blood.

## 14.4.2 ECM Remodeling Mechanisms

**Fibrin Deposition and Provisional Matrix Formation**

An important and almost immediate consequence of VEGF-A action is leakage of plasma proteins, including fibrinogen and other clotting factors. Vascular hyperpermeability and extravasation of plasma proteins leads to activation of the coagulation system by a tissue factor-mediated mechanism. As a result, extravasated plasma fibrinogen is rapidly clotted to form an extravascular gel of crosslinked fibrin.

Extravascular fibrin deposits are important because they dramatically alter the local microenvironment, transforming the erstwhile inert extravascular matrix of normal adult tissues into a proangiogenic provisional matrix that favors and apparently stimulates inward migration of host mesenchymal cells.

## 14.4.3 ECM and Cancer Cell Behavior

**Invasion and Metastasis**

The extracellular matrix (ECM), as part of the TME, is essential for asymmetric cell division and maintenance of tissue polarity; it may block or facilitate cell migration, determine the direction of cellâ€“cell communication, and bind to growth factors to prevent their free diffusion.

**Therapeutic Implications**

Pancreatic cancer cells in vitro show a similar response to chemotherapeutic agents as cell lines derived from other solid tumors. However, pancreatic cancer patients have a limited response to drugs such as paclitaxel compared to breast and prostate cancer patients, suggesting that the unique tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer plays a role in chemoresistance.

## 14.4.4 Therapeutic Targeting of ECM

**Stromal Targeting Approaches**

The complex interaction between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment in PDAC is beginning to be understood, and the disruption of these interactions is a promising new avenue for therapeutic targeting of PDAC.

Among these are therapies that reduce the tumor stroma, allowing for enhanced drug delivery to cancer cells, therapies that target specific signaling pathways within the stroma, and therapies that target the immune suppressive environment of the stroma.
