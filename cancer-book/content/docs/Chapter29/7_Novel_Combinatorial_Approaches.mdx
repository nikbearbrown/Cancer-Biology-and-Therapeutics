## 29.6.1 Rationale for Combination Therapy

**Tumor Heterogeneity:**
The most compelling rationale for combination chemotherapy, is (1) tumor cell heterogeneity and its implication for drug resistance, and (2) the success of combination chemotherapy in the clinic. There is ample clinical precedent for using multiple agents. Essentially all curative chemotherapy involves combinations of 2 and usually 3 or more agents.

**Overcoming Resistance:**
While tumors are clonal in origin, the increasing DNA instability that accompanies the onset of neoplasia leads to increased variation of daughter cells, referred to as clonal evolution to tumor cell heterogeneity. This is associated with selection for progeny with greater survival capacity, evident as a higher proliferative capacity, resistance to apoptosis, greater metastatic or invasive potential.

## 29.6.2 Mechanisms of Drug Resistance

**Bypass Pathways:**
One type is due to a mutation or genetic event affecting the target of the drug itself so that the kinase is still able to drive the growth of the tumor, despite the continued presence of the drug. Another type of resistance occurs when the cancer uses pathways that bypass the blocked kinase. These bypasses activate the same key downstream tumor growth-promoting signaling pathways.

**Rebound Activation:**
When researchers perturb one signaling pathway with a kinase inhibitor, it often causes rebound activation of these bypass backup pathways such that the effectiveness of the inhibitor is muted. Consequently, combination treatments are needed that target both the kinase and the bypass pathways.

## 29.6.3 Immunotherapy Combinations

**Enhanced Immune Response:**
Combinations with immunotherapies are also needed to fully provide the complexity of an antitumor immune response, and to make such a response more likely to be effective by combining it with chemotherapy or radiation. T cells that are removed from a patient's body and genetically engineered and/or treated with immune stimulants to boost their numbers and/or tumor-killing abilities will be more likely to shrink the patient's tumor if, prior to receiving that treatment, the patient receives "host conditioning" with chemotherapy or radiation.

**Checkpoint Inhibitor Combinations:**
In spite of the unprecedented broad impact of checkpoint blockade inhibitors, only approximately 20% of treated patients benefit from current checkpoint blockade. This limitation has driven extensive research into combination strategies to enhance response rates and overcome resistance.

## 29.6.4 Multi-Modal Treatment Strategies

**Metabolic Combination Approaches:**
Elgogary et al. found that targeting glutamine metabolism using the glutaminase inhibitor bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) encapsulated in nanoparticles effectively shrank pancreatic cancer tumor size and slowed proliferation. They discovered that the combined therapy provided enhanced efficacy that inhibited tumor growth significantly more compared to the single treatment of BPTES or metformin alone.

**Synergistic Targeting:**
These synergistic treatments are beneficial because they can work together when attempting to target different pathways. Still, the challenge remains to affect only the cancerous cells while not having a detrimental impact on benign, healthy cells.

## 29.6.5 Collaborative Drug Development

**Industry Collaboration:**
Perhaps the most important reason for collaboration is to speed up the process of drug development so that effective treatments are delivered sooner to cancer patients, who may not have time on their sides. The mounting evidence that combination targeted or immunotherapies will be more effective than single agents and the need to counter the heterogeneity and evolution of tumors drive collaborative approaches.

**Resource Sharing:**
Participants also stressed the importance of collaboration to develop combination therapies because of the inability of a single drug company to have the resources to effectively and expediently counter the complex mechanisms by which cancer cells become resistant to treatment.
