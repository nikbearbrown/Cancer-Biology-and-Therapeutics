title: 29.5 Metabolic Targeting Beyond the Warburg Effect

## 29.5.1 Evolution from the Classical Warburg Effect

**Historical Foundation:**
Otto Warburg observed a peculiar phenomenon in 1924, unknowingly laying the foundation for the field of cancer metabolism. While his contemporaries hypothesized that tumor cells derived the energy required for uncontrolled replication from proteolysis and lipolysis, Warburg instead found them to rapidly consume glucose and produce lactate even in the presence of oxygen.

**Beyond Simple Glycolysis:**
Tumor cells exhibit an upregulation in glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and gluconeogenesis as opposed to normal cells. Several oncogenes and tumor suppressors drive the metabolic reprogramming underlying the Warburg effect and other changes in glucose metabolism. There is heterogeneity in glucose metabolism across tumor types as well as within the tumor microenvironment.

## 29.5.2 Metabolic Heterogeneity and Tumor Microenvironment

**Intratumoral Diversity:**
These phenotypes offer cancerous cells one of the most valued assets in their battle for survival: their metabolic diversity, which can explain why it is so difficult to find effective therapies for most cancers. Tumors have different genetic and metabolic phenotypes due to different environmental pressures such as vascularization, oxygen supply, and other factors such as drug treatments.

**Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Interactions:**
Within the TME of solid tumors, heterogeneous cancer cells and CAFs interact by transferring their metabolites, including amino acids, fatty acids, ketone bodies, cytokines, and growth factors, which reciprocally facilitate the growth of cancer cells. Moreover, CAFs provide not only a structural matrix for providing a tumor-friendly microenvironment to cancer cells but also nutrients for cancer cells.

## 29.5.3 Novel Metabolic Targets

**Glutamine Metabolism:**
Hypoxic cells use glutamine to generate citrate from α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in response to a reduced supply of glucose-derived citrate. Targeting glutamine metabolism was further investigated not only by their follow-up works but also by other teams. This dependence of cancer cells on glutamine metabolism has translated into clinical trials as a novel therapy for cancer patients.

**Lipid Metabolism:**
According to Ackerman and Simon, adipocytes within TMEs play a key role in increasing lipolysis and secreting fatty acids for energy production, contributing to an aggressive growth phenotype. Lipids produced from adipocytes were used by ovarian cancer cells in order to help tumor growth. These findings suggest that adipocytes are key players in tumor growth by supplying fatty acids.

## 29.5.4 Reverse Warburg Effect and Metabolic Symbiosis

**Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Metabolism:**
Recent studies, however, have revolutionized the way scientists view the TME, especially the cross talk between CAFs and cancer cells and the effect of this cross talk on metabolism. The Warburg effect, a phenomenon initially believed to be limited to cancer cells, has also been observed in the fibroblasts surrounding the cancer cells. To distinguish this CAF-related phenomenon from its cancer cell-related counterpart, Pavlides et al. named it the reverse Warburg effect.

**Metabolic Coupling:**
CAF-derived lactate is crucial in prostate cancer metabolic transformation towards OXPHOS. CAFs can transfer functional mitochondria to prostate cancer cells. CAFs augment cancer's addiction to glutamine and its metabolically relevant consequences. Alanine secreted by pancreatic stellate cells supports tumor metabolism.

## 29.5.5 Therapeutic Implications and Combination Strategies

**Multi-target Approaches:**
Metabolic cross talk between CAFs and cancer can be a metabolic target for cancer therapy. The reverse Warburg effects can be targeted via disruption of the "lactate shuttle" by MCT1/MCT 4 inhibitors. Metformin can be used to inhibit glycolysis and block the function of CAFs, which promote cancer cell growth.

**Clinical Translation Challenges:**
Numerous therapies targeting glucose metabolism have been developed but have yet to show success in clinical trials. Unfortunately, there has been little clinical success given that glycolysis is crucial to the glucose metabolism of normal cells as well. Thus, the focus should be on targeting those elements of aerobic glycolysis, which are more upregulated in cancer.
