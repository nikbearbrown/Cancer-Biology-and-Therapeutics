title: 29.1 Liquid Biopsies and Circulating Tumor DNA for Monitoring and Early Detection
---




## 29.1.1 Foundations and Definition

Liquid biopsy, the sampling of cellular material from a solid tumor that has actively or passively entered the bloodstream, is an exciting area of research in cancer diagnostics. Tumor-derived components amenable to liquid biopsy include circulating tumor cells, exosomes, and circulating nucleic acids such as cell-free DNA and noncoding RNA. The term "cell-free DNA (cfDNA)" refers to fragmented DNA (genetic material) found outside cells in the blood and was first reported by Mandel and Metais in 1948.

**Core Components of Liquid Biopsy:**
- **Circulating tumor cells (CTCs)**: Cells shed from primary and metastatic sites of solid tumors into the bloodstream
- **Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)**: DNA fragments released from tumor cells during apoptosis or necrosis
- **Cell-free RNA (cfRNA)**: RNA molecules circulating in blood plasma
- **Exosomes**: Extracellular vesicles containing genetic material
- **Tumor-educated platelets**: Platelets that have been influenced by tumor cells

## 29.1.2 Technical Approaches and Methodologies

**ctDNA Detection and Analysis:**
Compared to the isolation of circulating tumor cells, isolation of ctDNA is straightforward. Five to twenty milliliters of peripheral blood is drawn in a collection tube containing anticoagulant and preservatives. Cells are removed by centrifugation leaving plasma from which cfDNA can then be extracted using commercially available kits. cfDNA is generally procured from plasma rather than serum, due to the risk of increased non-tumor cfDNA from cell lysis when serum separator tubes are used.

**Technical Challenges:**
Distinguishing ctDNA from non-tumor cfDNA is a major challenge in liquid biopsy research, analogous to the "needle-in-a-haystack" problem of identifying CTCs among blood cells. Success depends on the sensitivity of the method employed for DNA analysis. While traditional RT-PCR has been used to identify point mutations, newer higher sensitivity methods with the potential for absolute quantification include digital PCR in which samples are diluted to one template per PCR reaction.

## 29.1.3 Clinical Applications Across Cancer Types

**Hepatocellular Carcinoma:**
The qualitative and quantitative analysis of these biomarkers holds promise for improving the clinical care of individuals with HCC. In particular, research has focused on the role of liquid biopsy in the detection of HCC at an early and curable stage, given the major clinical need for biomarkers for this purpose. However, commonly used surveillance tools including serum AFP and liver ultrasonography are suboptimal, suffering from low sensitivity for early lesions.

**Uveal Melanoma:**
The detection and characterization of circulating melanoma cells (CMCs) can aid in the diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring of UM patients. Furthermore, CMCs provide additional information that cannot be acquired by studying the primary tumor alone. CMCs can be characterized for the presence of key prognostic factors, such as monosomy-3, and used as a prognostic tool particularly in patients undergoing eye-preserving therapy and where no tumor biopsy is collected.

## 29.1.4 Monitoring Treatment Response and Disease Progression

**Real-time Disease Monitoring:**
For diagnosed early-stage cancer, liquid biopsy could play a role in risk stratification and detection of recurrence after treatment. In the setting of metastatic cancer, liquid biopsy could aid in treatment selection, monitoring of response, and understanding mechanisms of resistance. Each cellular component targeted by liquid biopsy has both strengths and weaknesses in addressing these clinical needs.

**Prognostic Significance:**
Their presence correlates with an unfavorable prognosis and a reduced progression-free interval, and various studies have shown that the monitoring of CTC allows for the evaluation of treatment efficacy in different tumors. It is assumed that the CTCs are predecessors of a metastatic settlement and thus the main element of the metastatic process itself.

## 29.1.5 Current Limitations and Future Directions

**Technical Challenges:**
Despite these potential benefits for cancer care and cancer patients, the implementation of liquid biopsies has a number of considerations and hurdles to overcome, such as the need for further validation, increases in sensitivity and specificity, and the rare nature of cancer mutations. Although liquid biopsy has increasingly been adopted and explored for clinical care, careful analytic and clinical validation, and additional preclinical studies addressing the biology of liquid biopsy analytes are needed.

**Clinical Translation:**
Circulating tumour DNA can be measured across various scales ranging from single mutations to the analysis of the whole genome. Targeting a known tumour mutation has shown to have greater sensitivity (a test that correctly identifies patients with the disease), whereas applying a broader genome approach can be less sensitive. The type of method utilized can present different challenges when attempting to use it for purposes of screening or diagnosis.
