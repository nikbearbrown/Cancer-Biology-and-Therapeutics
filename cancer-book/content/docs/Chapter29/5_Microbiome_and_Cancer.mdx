## 29.4.1 Microbiome Composition and Cancer Development

**Gut Microbiota Fundamentals:**
The understanding of the complex relationship between the human microbiota and its host organism has expanded rapidly in recent years, fuelled by high-throughput metagenomic sequencing technologies, advanced bioinformatics analysis methodology, and the development of experimental model systems. Research focusing primarily on the gut microbiota has led to a growing appreciation of its key role in maintaining health, and of dysbiotic gut microbiome states being associated with many common human disorders, including cancer.

**Carcinogenic Mechanisms:**
To date, bacterial mechanisms that promote carcinogenesis are still incompletely elucidated. However, a few bacterial genotoxins and carcinogens are well described, as well as mechanisms by which bacteria reprogramme host signalling towards neoplastic transformation, promote inflammation, or protect against immunosurveillance.

## 29.4.2 Microbiome's Role in Cancer Therapy

**Immunotherapy Modulation:**
Recent research has uncovered profound effects of the gut microbiota on cancer therapies. Strikingly, response to immunotherapy depends partially on an intact gut microbiota with immunostimulatory function. Whereas antibiotics compromise immunotherapy response, microbiome modulation can enhance it.

**Chemotherapy Interactions:**
The efficacy of cisplatin and oxaliplatin is greatly decreased in mice under germ-free conditions or when their gut microbiome has been perturbed with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The immunogenic cell death that these drugs induce is dependent on inflammatory responses (partially mediated by signalling through pattern recognition receptors), which in mouse models were enhanced by the administration of specific bacterial species.

## 29.4.3 Clinical Implications for Treatment Response

**Predictive Biomarkers:**
Clinical and preclinical studies have indicated that the composition of the gut microbiota is an important cause of heterogeneous patient response to cancer immunotherapy, among several other factors that determine the cancer immune phenotype. These studies have shown that the composition and diversity of a patient's gut microbiota (assessed before the start of treatment) are predictive of the response to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors.

**Site-Specific Associations:**
Moreover, the microbiota colonizing the pancreas was found to play an important role in regulating the inflammatory tone in the pancreatic tumour microenvironment in mice via pattern recognition receptor signalling. However, larger clinical studies are needed to validate individual microbial taxa enriched in pancreatic tissue or in the mouth and the gut of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

## 29.4.4 Therapeutic Microbiome Modulation

**Probiotic Interventions:**
The accumulating evidence that gut microbes affect cancer therapy has reinforced interest in microbiome modulations that aim to improve response rates. Along these lines, preclinical studies have found beneficial effects of probiotics (oral administration of defined live bacterial strains) on progression-free survival in mice when administered alone or in combination with immunotherapy.

**Regulatory Challenges:**
However, current regulations impede the rapid clinical translation of these findings; strict regulation of probiotics as combination therapies with immunotherapeutic treatment modalities necessitates extensive clinical trials. An attractive alternative may be to instead focus on prebiotics (dietary compounds that stimulate the growth of certain gut microbial clades) or diets that are rationally designed to modulate the gut microbiome.

## 29.4.5 Therapeutic Microbes as Cancer Treatment

**Direct Anticancer Applications:**
Some viruses and species of bacteria can be targeted to kill cancer cells while others can be deployed to replicate in and kill tumors. Whereas other bacteria pass through or are killed in the gut, Salmonella cells infect intestinal epithelial cells, where they induce immune responses and attract immune cells. They also infect macrophages, which can be used as delivery vehicles to target Salmonella to tumor tissue.

**Combination Therapy Potential:**
Combining therapeutic microbes with traditional therapies may prove necessary when treating some cases in which cancer or antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are particularly resilient. Moreover, clinical trial protocols likely will require testing therapeutic microbes in combination with standard of care treatments.
