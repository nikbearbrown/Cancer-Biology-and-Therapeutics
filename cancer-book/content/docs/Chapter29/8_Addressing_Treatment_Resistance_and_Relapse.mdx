title: 29.7 Addressing Treatment Resistance and Relapse

## 29.7.1 Mechanisms of Treatment Resistance

**Primary and Acquired Resistance:**
In general, systemic agents are active at the beginning of therapy in 90% of primary breast cancers and 50% of metastases. However, after a variable period of time, progression occurs. At this point, resistance to therapy is not only common, it is expected. Treatment resistance is most commonly seen in such patients. They initially may have a response to different agents, but the responses are not sustained.

**Genetic Evolution:**
Thus far, MM remains an incurable disease, with a significant number of patients relapsing due to evolving genetic mutations in tumor cells resulting in treatment resistance. The etiology of RRMM is not well understood. Identifying risk factors enables clinicians to implement targeted intervention strategies and preventive measures.

## 29.7.2 Patterns of Relapse

**Disease Recurrence:**
Despite advances in early detection and understanding of the molecular bases of breast cancer biology, approximately 30% of all patients with early-stage breast cancer have recurrent disease, which is metastatic in most cases. The rates of local and systemic recurrence vary within different series, but in general, distant recurrences are dominant.

**Time to Progression:**
Patients who experience a relapse after remission usually die within 1 year, even if a second complete remission is achieved. Most patients with MM will respond well to the first line of therapy, but most will relapse as conventional treatment is not curative.

## 29.7.3 Strategies to Overcome Resistance

**Sequential Therapy Approaches:**
Therapies can be repeated in RRMM depending on prior efficacy and length of remission on the initial response. Clinicians must consider the possibility of cross-resistance among drugs from the same therapeutic group. While choosing treatment options, resistance to a specific class of the drug, the patient's age and other comorbidities, and prior or residual toxicities should be considered.

**Novel Agent Integration:**
Incorporating novel agents into a transplant concept is an exciting new field of investigation, because in many cases, auto-HSCT alone does not lead to cure. To reduce the risk of relapse, well-designed clinical trial with novel agents is necessary.

## 29.7.4 Prevention of Relapse

**Maintenance Therapy:**
Relapse has become the most frequent cause of treatment failure after HSCT. Because outcome after relapse remains poor, major effect is focused on prevention of relapse. Beside adoptive cell-based options, such as DLI, the availability of novel effective pharmacological compounds has opened new avenues in clinical research to use those drugs early after HSCT in order to prevent relapse.

**Targeted Prevention Strategies:**
Anti-CD30 antibody drugs conjugate brentuximab vedotin as maintenance therapy after auto-HSCT for HL did improve PFS but not OS. Bispecific antibodies such as CD19-directed CD3 T-cell-engaged blinatumomab are active in relapsed and refractory ALL and also in MRD positive ALL.

## 29.7.5 Future Directions in Resistance Management

**Personalized Resistance Profiling:**
Chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance assays are laboratory tests that pretend to select the most appropriate treatment by studying an individual's tumor behavior when exposed to certain drugs. The goal is to individualize therapy, optimize resources, and reduce toxicity.

**Adaptive Treatment Strategies:**
While certain subpopulations with defined metabolic phenotypes may be sensitive to a suitable metabolic inhibitor, other subclones with different metabolic phenotypes may well be resistant to that drug. This explains why patients may become unresponsive to second-round treatment after an initial successful first round.
