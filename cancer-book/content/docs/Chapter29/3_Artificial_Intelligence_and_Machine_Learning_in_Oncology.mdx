## 29.2.1 Historical Context and Current Landscape

**Evolution of AI in Healthcare:**
The field of machine learning applies the scientific method to representing, understanding, and utilizing datasets, and, as a result, practitioners are known as data scientists. Around 2010, AI began its resurgence to prominence due to the success of machine learning and data science techniques as well as significant increases in computational storage and power.

**Growth in Medical Literature:**
Figure 2 illustrates the explosive growth of ML and AI through the number of Pubmed publications over the years between 1990 and 2022. The rate of growth in AI and ML far outpaces the overall growth rate of publications since 2015. In health AI, machine Learning enjoys most of the growth, with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image Analysis following closely.

## 29.2.2 Applications in Cancer Research

**Drug Discovery and Development:**
The big data revolution, accompanied by the development and deployment of wearable medical devices and mobile health applications, has enabled the biomedical community to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to vast amounts of data. This shift has created new research opportunities in predictive analytics, precision medicine, virtual diagnosis, patient monitoring, and drug discovery and delivery.

**Genomic Analysis:**
One noteworthy DARPA project is called Big Mechanism, which is developing an AI system that can read research on cell biology, extract enough information out of it to construct a candidate model of cancer pathways in the cell, interact with a human biologist to try to refine the model, and develop a hypothesis and a causal model of what is happening.

## 29.2.3 Clinical Decision Support Systems

**Diagnostic Applications:**
Many AI technologies can be applied to different aspects of science, such as AI-guided sensors, natural language techniques to process scientific literature, and computer vision for analyzing medical images. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care offers unprecedented opportunities to improve patient and clinical team outcomes, reduce costs, and impact population health.

**Treatment Planning:**
Programming AI and machine learning is still 99 percent human work. The equation for AI success is to take a set of categories (for example, cats and dogs) and an enormous amount of data (that is labeled as to whether it is a cat or a dog), and then feed those two inputs through an algorithm.

## 29.2.4 Challenges and Limitations

**Data Quality and Bias:**
How vulnerable are algorithms to bias and unfairness? How can research improve the process of detecting unfairness in machine learning algorithms? These questions require interdisciplinary discussion and collaboration.

**Validation and Regulatory Considerations:**
Well-constructed ML models do have general applicability beyond the training data, otherwise they would be just a catalogue of past problem instances and their solutions, without the ability to be used for new problem instances. Machine Learning theory provides results and techniques that enable and ideally guarantee the generalization properties of ML models beyond the training data.

## 29.2.5 Future Directions and Integration

**Collaborative AI Systems:**
In time, it would be very important to reach a point where an AI model has developed an understanding of a phenomenon and can explain it to human scientists. There is great potential in AI being used to create and work with digital twins in studying such things as the human body.

**Personalized Medicine:**
AI could play a role in helping scientists do their jobs betterâ€”report their findings better, put them in context better, verify them better, and so on. The goal is to create experiences that feel premium and cutting-edge while maintaining scientific rigor.
