## 29.3.1 Patient-Derived Xenograft Models

**Definition and Advantages:**
Patient-derived xenografts (PDX), a recent focus of glioblastoma research, are used extensively in translational research. The PDX model has the advantage of retaining both the genetic and histological features of the primary tumor from which it was derived. Because the tumors are propagated in successive generations of mice, PDX cells are not subjected to stresses that can arise in cell cultures.

**Model Development:**
PDX models are generally established by injecting glioblastoma tumor spheres produced under serum-free neurosphere-culture conditions, into immunodeficient mice. Another method for establishing PDX models is to inject tissues from fresh brain-tumor biopsies into immunodeficient mice. The biopsy tissue is generally minced with surgical blades and placed in flasks containing standard serum-supplemented tissue-culture medium.

## 29.3.2 Advantages of PDX Models Over Traditional Cell Lines

**Genetic Fidelity:**
Patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models are created from direct implantation of either biopsied tumor fragments or freshly isolated cells without the need for intermediate cell culture. These models retain the genetic, histological, and molecular profile similar to the primary tumors, even after multiple cell passages.

**Tumor Microenvironment Preservation:**
Under these conditions, tumor spheroids form quickly, and the spheroids maintain the architecture of the original tissue, including the endothelium, extracellular matrix components, and resident macrophages. PDX models from fresh brain-tumor biopsies display diffuse single-cell infiltration when implanted into the brain of immunodeficient rats or mice.

## 29.3.3 Applications in Drug Development

**Preclinical Testing:**
The value of PDX models in predicting human clinical-trial drug responses was recently highlighted by a study of 1000 PDX cancer models from various primary sites, and by the establishment of a large-scale breast-cancer PDX biobank. This type of large-scale PDX bank is likely to prove valuable for predicting human responses to clinical trials of new glioblastoma drugs, and should help make it possible to tailor therapy to the individual patient.

**Personalized Medicine Applications:**
When a glioblastoma tumor is resected surgically, the tumor cells can be an invaluable source of information that can (and should) be utilized to guide patient treatment (personalized medicine). The tumor cells could potentially be used in a number of platforms, including RNA expression analysis, protein characterization, and metabolic profiling.

## 29.3.4 Technical Considerations and Limitations

**Model Selection:**
There is some controversy as to whether PDX models are best established by injecting freshly biopsied tumor tissue or cultured tumor spheres into mice, and whether orthotopic or subcutaneous xenograft is preferable. While orthotopic xenografts more closely mimic the clinical situation, subcutaneous xenografts are less technically challenging than orthotopic xenografts and are easily passaged in vivo.

**Immunodeficiency Requirements:**
The human tumor cells are transplanted into immunocompromised mice to ensure that the mouse does not reject the human cells. Some common and readily accepted immunocompromised mice are athymic nude mice, severely compromised immunodeficient mice (SCID), or non-obese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice.

## 29.3.5 Organoid Technology

**Three-Dimensional Culture Systems:**
Once targets are identified, appropriate models can be generated to test treatment strategies, including 3D platforms such as ex vivo Organ-on-Chip, in vitro cell culture methods including spheroids and organoids, and of course mouse models, transgenic and/or intracranial xenograft as well as large animals.

**Advantages for Drug Screening:**
However, a disadvantage is that PDOX models are costly and require fresh tumor fragments/cells, therefore limiting the number of facilities that can use these models. In addition to PDOX, other patient derived xenografts can be created by injecting glioblastoma tumor spheres, also known as neurospheres.
