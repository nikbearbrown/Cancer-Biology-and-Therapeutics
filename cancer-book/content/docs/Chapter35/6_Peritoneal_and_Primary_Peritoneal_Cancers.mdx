title: 35.5 Peritoneal and Primary Peritoneal Cancers
---



## Introduction and Classification

The infiltration of malignant cells into the serous membrane that lines the abdominal cavity, viscera, and coelom in amniotes is termed peritoneal surface malignancy or peritoneal cancer. This condition is categorized into primary and secondary types.

Primary mesothelioma arises from the de novo development of cancer in the mesothelium of the abdomen. In contrast, secondary peritoneal cancer occurs due to the spread of tumor cells from other locations into the peritoneal cavity.

## Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma

Primary peritoneal cancer is further classified based on histology, with terms such as extraovarian primary peritoneal carcinoma (EOPPC), serous surface papillary carcinoma, papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum, extraovarian Mullerian adenocarcinoma, and normal-sized ovarian carcinoma syndrome being used to describe this type.

**Extraovarian Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma (EOPPC)**

Extraovarian primary peritoneal carcinoma (EOPPC) is a malignancy that spreads widely inside the peritoneal cavity involving mostly the omentum with minimal or no ovarian involvement. Most reported cases of EOPPC are of serous histology (serous surface carcinoma).

EOPPC behaves similarly to serous ovarian cancer, often with minimal involvement of the ovaries. Germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene have been identified in approximately 17.6% of EOPPC cases.

## Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma

Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM), on the other hand, is an aggressive tumor associated with asbestos exposure in 33% to 50% of cases. This condition primarily affects older men (60+).

**Histological Features**

MPM is characterized by malignant proliferation of mesothelial cells lining the peritoneum. Histologically, it can present as epithelioid, sarcomatoid, or biphasic subtypes, with epithelioid mesothelioma being the most common.

## Secondary Peritoneal Cancer (Peritoneal Carcinomatosis)

The term peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) generally refers to the metastatic involvement of the peritoneum. The name was first coined in 1931 by Sampson to thoroughly describe metastatic involvement of the peritoneal stromal surface by ovarian cancer cells.

Peritoneal surface malignancy may occur as a primary disease, such as peritoneal mesothelioma and primary peritoneal carcinoma, or as a metastatic tumor originating most often from carcinomas of the ovary, stomach, pancreas, and colon.

## Clinical Presentation

The symptoms of peritoneal carcinomatosis can vary depending on the extent and location of secondary metastatic deposits. The growth of both primary and secondary tumors can exert pressure effects, leading to mechanical intestinal obstruction, potentially resulting in patients presenting with an "acute abdomen" as a medical emergency.

Common presentations include abdominal distension, ascites, bowel obstruction, and constitutional symptoms such as weight loss and fatigue.

## Diagnostic Approach

Diagnosis typically requires cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) followed by tissue confirmation through biopsy or surgical exploration. Tumor markers such as CA-125, CEA, and others may be elevated depending on the primary site of origin.

## Treatment Strategies

### Cytoreductive Surgery and HIPEC

Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has become the treatment of choice for treating peritoneal metastases from ovarian, stomach, or colorectal cancers. Nowadays, surgical cytoreduction combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS / HIPEC) has radically changed the approach of patients with malignant tumors of the peritoneum.

This involves administering cytotoxic agents into the peritoneal cavity at an elevated temperature (41 to 43 degrees C) to promote their absorption by neoplastic nodules.

### Prognosis by Primary Site

A median survival of 6 months for colorectal cancer and 3 months for gastric cancer shows a clearly limited prognosis. Results for peritoneal mesothelioma with systemic chemotherapy are similar. The probability of survival is better for advanced ovarian cancer, for which a median survival of up to 2 years is possible.

## Special Entities

### Pseudomyxoma Peritonei

Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare clinical entity, characterized by diffuse intra-abdominal gelatinous ascites, the so-called "jelly belly," with mucinous implants on peritoneal surfaces. 

It has been more widely used to describe peritoneal dissemination of mucus-producing neoplasm most frequently from the appendix, but also small and large bowel, stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, gallbladder, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.
