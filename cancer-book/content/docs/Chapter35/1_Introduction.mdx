Rare and orphan cancers represent a heterogeneous group of malignancies that collectively account for a significant portion of cancer diagnoses despite their individual low incidence rates. These cancers present unique challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and research due to their rarity, diverse biological behavior, and limited therapeutic options. This chapter focuses on five important categories of rare cancers: sarcomas, thymic tumors, gestational trophoblastic disease, adrenocortical carcinoma, and peritoneal and primary peritoneal cancers. Understanding these entities is crucial for medical professionals as they require specialized knowledge and multidisciplinary approaches to optimize patient outcomes.
