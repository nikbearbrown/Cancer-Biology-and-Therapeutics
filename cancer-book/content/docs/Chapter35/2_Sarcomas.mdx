## Introduction and Classification

Sarcomas are rare malignant tumors arising from connective tissues, including bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, and other supportive tissues. Soft tissue sarcomas are rare, with approximately 12,020 new cases and 4,740 deaths reported in 2014 in the United States, accounting for approximately 1% of all cancer incidence and representing approximately 2% of cancer-related deaths. Sarcomas are categorically separated by location within the body, with extremity and trunk soft tissue sarcomas (STS) being more common than intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal cases.

Sarcomas are broadly classified into two major categories: bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas, each with distinct biological behaviors, treatment approaches, and prognoses.

## Bone Sarcomas

### Osteosarcoma

Osteosarcoma, or osteogenic sarcoma, is the most common primary malignant bone tumor, accounting for approximately 20% of all cases. Osteosarcoma demonstrates a bimodal age distribution and most commonly occurs in the extremities. Approximately 75% of osteosarcoma diagnoses occur in patients less than 25 years of age; the average at diagnosis is 20 years. However, in patients 65 years and older, osteosarcoma often occurs secondary to irradiation or Paget's disease of bone.

**Pathophysiology and Molecular Biology**

The diagnosis of osteosarcoma is based on histopathologic criteria and depends on the presence of malignant cells associated with the production of osteoid. Great variability exists in the histologic patterns and degree of osteoid production. Osteosarcomas arise from mesenchymal tissue capable of differentiating toward fibrous tissue, cartilage, or bone.

**Genetic Alterations**

Variants in the TP53 gene are found in approximately 70% of patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), which is associated with increased risk of osteosarcoma, breast cancer, various brain cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, and other cancers. One study observed a high frequency of young patients (age &lt;30 years) with osteosarcoma carrying known LFS-associated or likely LFS-associated TP53 variants (3.8%) or rare exonic TP53 variants (5.7%).

**Clinical Presentation**

The most common clinical presentation of osteosarcoma is pain in the involved region of bone, with or without an associated soft tissue mass. Pain is often attributed to trauma or vigorous physical exercise, both of which are common in the patient population at risk. Symptoms are usually present for several months before the diagnosis is made, with an average duration of approximately 3 months.

**Anatomical Distribution**

Osteosarcoma can occur in any bone of the body. Among young patients, the most common site is the metaphysis of a long bone. Approximately half of all osteosarcomas originate in the region around the knee. The most frequent primary site is the distal femur, followed by the proximal tibia. The proximal humerus is the third most common location.

**Staging and Imaging**

The 2020 WHO classification subdivided secondary osteosarcoma into 6 subtypes: osteosarcoma in Paget's disease of bone, radiation-associated osteosarcoma, infarct-related osteosarcoma, osteosarcoma due to chronic osteomyelitis, implant-related osteosarcoma, and osteosarcoma associated with disorders like fibrous dysplasia.

High-grade osteosarcoma will often be described as having a permeative or moth-eaten appearance with a "sunburst" configuration due to aggressive periostitis or "Codman triangle" configuration due to elevation of the periosteum away from the bone.

**Treatment and Prognosis**

Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%. For osteosarcoma, the 5-year relative survival rate increased over the same time from 40% to 72% in children younger than 15 years and from 56% to approximately 71% in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.

Treatment typically involves multimodal therapy including neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical resection, and adjuvant chemotherapy. The vast majority of patients (about 85 to 90%) with osteosarcoma undergo limb salvage, which involves removal of a tumor from a limb without removal of the entire limb itself.

## Soft Tissue Sarcomas

### Rhabdomyosarcoma

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a malignant soft tissue sarcoma that is believed to originate from primitive mesenchymal cells that typically differentiate into skeletal tissue. However, these tumors can also arise in other types of tissue and any anatomic area. RMS is the most common soft tissue sarcoma diagnosed in children; only 1% to 2% of these cancers are found in adults.

**Epidemiology**

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare condition making up 3% of all pediatric cancers. However, RMS is the most common childhood and adolescent soft tissue sarcoma, comprising 50% of soft tissue sarcomas in individuals younger than 20. In the US, there are approximately 350 newly diagnosed patients each year.

**Histological Classifications**

Rhabdomyosarcoma is classified into histologic subtypes: embryonal, alveolar, pleomorphic, spindle, and mixed-type. Embryonal is the most commonly occurring subtype and also has the best prognosis. The pleomorphic and alveolar subtypes have the highest rates of metastases and consequently the poorest prognosis.

**Diagnosis and Molecular Features**

The identification of rhabdomyosarcoma is sometimes difficult due to the histologic similarity of the tumor to the other small, blue, round-cell pediatric bone and soft tissue tumors (eg, Wilms tumor, lymphoma, small-cell osteosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma). Therefore, specific immunohistochemistry stains, indicative of skeletal tissue, are usually used to differentiate RMS from other tumor pathologies.

Differential diagnoses can be narrowed for tumors with characteristic RMS findings, including positive staining for skeletal markers (eg, myogenin, desmin, and Myo-D1).

### Other Soft Tissue Sarcomas

Pediatric soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogenous group of malignant tumors that originate from primitive mesenchymal tissue and account for 7% of all childhood tumors (rhabdomyosarcomas, 4%; other soft tissue sarcomas, 3%). Nonrhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcomas are more common in adolescents and adults.

**Risk Stratification and Staging**

Staging of soft tissue sarcomas utilizes the TNM system as well as tumor grading. The T-staging is based on size and location (i.e., trunk/extremity, retroperitoneal, head, neck, etc.). The size cutoffs for T-staging vary based on tumor location. Certain sarcoma subtypes have a propensity for lymph node metastasis, such as epithelial sarcomas, clear cell sarcomas, angiosarcomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas.
