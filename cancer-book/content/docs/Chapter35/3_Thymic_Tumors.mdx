title: 35.2 Thymic Tumors
---



## Introduction and Classification

Thymomas and thymic carcinomas are the most common mass of the anterior mediastinum. They account for approximately 20% of all mediastinal neoplasms. They commonly occur between the fourth and sixth decades of life. No sexual or racial predilection exists.

Thymoma and thymic carcinoma, collectively termed thymic epithelial tumors (TETs), are relatively rare tumors arising from the thymus. Although infrequent, TETs are the most common tumors of the anterior mediastinum in adults.

## Pathophysiology and WHO Classification

The fourth edition of the WHO classification, published in 2015, contains refined histological and immunohistochemical diagnostic criteria and is the most widely accepted cellular classification of TETs. Thymomas arise from the thymic epithelium and consist of epithelial cells mixed with varying proportions of immature T cells.

**Thymoma Subtypes**

Subtype B1 has areas of medullary differentiation (medullary islands) and scattered epithelial cells without clustering (< 3 contiguous epithelial cells). Subtype B2 has more epithelial cells that cluster (3+ contiguous epithelial cells). Subtype B3 is often confused with thymic carcinoma or metastatic SCC from other sites.

**Thymic Carcinoma**

Thymic carcinoma is a TET that exhibits a definite cytological atypia and a set of histological features no longer specific to the thymus but similar to histological features observed in carcinomas of other organs. Unlike type A and B thymomas, thymic carcinomas lack immature lymphocytes.

## Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis

Most patients with thymoma or thymic carcinoma are asymptomatic at diagnosis. About one-third of patients present with symptoms that arise either from the underlying tumor or from the presence of associated autoimmune paraneoplastic diseases. Typical clinical signs and symptoms include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, hoarseness of voice, phrenic nerve palsy, or signs suggestive of superior vena cava syndrome.

## Molecular Characteristics

TETs have the lowest tumor mutational burden of all adult cancers. Multiplatform analyses have revealed four molecular subtypes that are associated with survival and WHO histological subtypes. Pathogenic variants in HRAS, NRAS, TP53, and GTF2I have been observed.

## Staging and Prognosis

Several different systems are used for the staging of thymomas, including the AJCC TNM system and the Masaoka system. The degree of invasion or tumor stage is generally thought to be a more important indicator of overall survival (OS).

Thymomas are slow-growing neoplasms. The most accurate adverse prognostic marker is the invasiveness of the tumor. 

## Treatment Considerations

Treatment typically involves surgical resection when feasible, followed by radiation therapy for incompletely resected or advanced disease. Chemotherapy may be used for metastatic or unresectable disease.

**Pediatric Considerations**

A review of the SEER Program registry from 1973 to 2008 identified 73 cases of malignant anterior mediastinal tumors in patients younger than 20 years. Of these cases, 32% were thymomas, 29% were non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and 22% were Hodgkin lymphomas. Patients with thymomas who were treated between 1991 and 2008 had a survival rate of 75%, compared to 18% for those treated in an earlier era from 1973 to 1989.
