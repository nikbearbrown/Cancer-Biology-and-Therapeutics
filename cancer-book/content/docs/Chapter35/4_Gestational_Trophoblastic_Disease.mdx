title: 35.3 Gestational Trophoblastic Disease
---



## Introduction and Classification

Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a group of tumors defined by abnormal trophoblastic proliferation. Trophoblasts produce human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GTD is divided into hydatidiform moles (HM), which contain villi, and other trophoblastic neoplasms, which lack villi.

The nonmolar or malignant forms of GTD are called gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) and include the invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT), and placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). These malignancies can occur weeks or even years following any pregnancy but occur most commonly after a molar pregnancy.

## Hydatidiform Moles

A hydatidiform mole, commonly referred to as a molar pregnancy, is a rare abnormality in pregnancy classified under gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTD), which stem from the placenta and may metastasize. Hydatidiform moles are characterized by abnormal fertilization, resulting in villous hydrops and trophoblastic hyperplasia with or without embryonic development.

**Types of Molar Pregnancies**

**Complete Hydatidiform Mole**
A complete HM forms when sperm fertilizes an egg that does not contain the mother's DNA. The egg has DNA from the father and the cells that were meant to become the placenta are abnormal.

**Partial Hydatidiform Mole**
A partial HM forms when sperm fertilizes a normal egg and there are two sets of DNA from the father in the fertilized egg. Only part of the fetus forms and the cells that were meant to become the placenta are abnormal.

## Clinical Presentation

The presentation of a partial hydatidiform mole is usually less dramatic than that of a complete mole. These patients typically present with symptoms similar to a threatened or spontaneous abortion, including vaginal bleeding.

**Complete Mole Presentation**
Symptoms include vaginal bleeding in the first trimester, severe nausea, and high β-hCG levels. Late findings of the disease, typically occurring around 14 to 16 weeks of pregnancy, include signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, including tachycardia and tremors, again caused by the high levels of circulating β-hCG.

## Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) includes invasive moles, choriocarcinomas, placental-site trophoblastic tumors (PSTT; very rare), and epithelioid trophoblastic tumors (ETT; even more rare).

### Choriocarcinoma

Choriocarcinoma, a subtype of gestational trophoblastic disease, is a rare and aggressive neoplasm. The 2 significant choriocarcinoma subtypes, namely: gestational and non-gestational, have very different biological activity and prognoses.

A choriocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that forms from trophoblast cells and spreads to the muscle layer of the uterus and nearby blood vessels. It may also spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain, lungs, liver, kidney, spleen, intestines, pelvis, or vagina.

## Diagnostic Methods

Detection of hCG is also helpful in evaluating trophoblastic disease, including complete and partial hydatidiform moles, postmolar tumors, gestational choriocarcinoma, testicular choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic disease. A total hCG level >100,000 mIU/mL in early pregnancy is highly suggestive of a complete hydatidiform mole.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Most hydatidiform moles are benign, but they sometimes become cancer. For disease that remains after surgery, treatment is usually chemotherapy.

Low-risk gestational choriocarcinoma has almost 100% survival in women treated with chemotherapy, and high-risk gestational choriocarcinoma patients have 91% to 93% survival when utilizing multi-agent chemotherapy with or without radiation and surgery.
