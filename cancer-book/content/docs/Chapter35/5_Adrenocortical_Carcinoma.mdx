title: 35.4 Adrenocortical Carcinoma
---



## Introduction and Epidemiology

Adrenocortical cancer (ACC) is a rare disease with an annual incidence of 0.7-2 cases per million per year and two distinct age distribution peaks, the first occurring in early adulthood and the second between 40-50 years with women being more often affected (55-60%).

Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) are very uncommon; these lesions are less common than cortical adenomas and pheochromocytoma. The worldwide incidence of ACC is 0.5 to 2 per 1 million people annually. However, this neoplasia accounts for 0.02 to 0.2% of all cancer-related deaths.

## Pathophysiology and Molecular Biology

Adrenocortical carcinomas are very aggressive lesions and in some cases may be functional and present with Cushing syndrome and/or virilization. In most cases, ACC is non-functional and presents as an abdominal mass or an incidental finding.

**Genetic Associations**

Although the great majority of ACCs are of sporadic origin, they can also develop as part of familial diseases the most common being the Beckwith-Wiedeman syndrome, the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, the Lynch syndrome, the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1, and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

## Histopathological Assessment

No absolute criteria of malignancy exist for lesions confined to the adrenal gland, but a Weiss score of 3 or higher, which is determined by histopathological features, is generally an indicator of malignancy.

ENSAT has shown that KI67 is the most powerful prognostic marker in both localized and advanced ACC and that higher Ki67 levels are consistently associated with worse prognosis.

## Clinical Presentation

Symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma include pain in the abdomen. A tumor of the adrenal cortex may be functioning (makes more hormones than normal) or nonfunctioning (does not make more hormones than normal). Most adrenocortical tumors are functioning. The hormones made by functioning tumors may cause certain signs or symptoms of disease.

**Pediatric Considerations**

Signs and symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma include a lump or pain in the abdomen. Most tumors of the adrenal cortex in children are functioning tumors. The extra hormones made by functioning tumors may cause certain signs or symptoms of disease and these depend on the type of hormone made by the tumor.

## Staging and Prognosis

The median overall survival (OS) of all ACC patients is about 3-4 years. The prognosis is, however, heterogeneous. Complete surgical resection provides the only means of cure. Five-year survival rate is 60-80% for tumors confined to the adrenal space, 35-50% for locally advanced disease, and significantly lower in case of metastatic disease ranging from 0% to 28%.

## Treatment Approaches

Complete surgical resection remains the primary treatment for localized disease. For advanced or metastatic disease, treatment options include chemotherapy (often mitotane-based regimens), radiation therapy, and supportive care. Treatment of stage IV adrenocortical carcinoma may include chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy, radiation therapy to bones or other sites where cancer has spread, and surgery to remove cancer that has spread to tissues near the adrenal cortex as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life.
