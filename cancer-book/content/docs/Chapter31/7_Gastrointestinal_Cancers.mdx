## 31.6.1 Gastric Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Gastric cancer incidence varies dramatically worldwide, with the highest rates in East Asia. Helicobacter pylori infection is a major risk factor.

**Pathology**: Adenocarcinoma represents the majority of gastric cancers, with classification into intestinal and diffuse types having prognostic significance.

**Treatment**: Surgery remains the primary curative treatment, with perioperative chemotherapy improving outcomes in advanced disease.

## 31.6.2 Pancreatic Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis, with five-year survival rates below 10%. Risk factors include smoking, diabetes, and genetic syndromes.

**Pathology**: Ductal adenocarcinoma represents approximately 90% of pancreatic cancers, with most arising in the head of the pancreas.

**Treatment**: Surgery offers the only chance for cure, but is possible in only 15-20% of patients. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy play palliative roles.

## 31.6.3 Liver Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary liver cancer, often developing in the setting of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.

**Pathology**: Hepatocellular carcinoma arising from hepatocytes is the predominant type, with risk factors including hepatitis B and C infections.

**Treatment**: Treatment options include surgery, transplantation, ablation, embolization, and systemic therapy, depending on liver function and tumor extent.
