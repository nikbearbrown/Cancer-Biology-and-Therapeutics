## 31.8.1 Melanoma

**Epidemiology**: Melanoma incidence has increased dramatically over recent decades, particularly in fair-skinned populations. UV radiation exposure is the primary risk factor.

**Pathology**: Melanoma arises from melanocytes and can occur in sun-exposed or sun-protected areas. Breslow thickness and ulceration are key prognostic factors.

**Treatment**: Surgery remains the primary treatment for localized disease, with adjuvant therapy and immunotherapy having revolutionized treatment of advanced disease.

## 31.8.2 Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer

**Basal Cell Carcinoma**: The most common skin cancer, typically with local invasion but rare metastasis.

**Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: More aggressive than basal cell carcinoma with potential for metastasis, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
