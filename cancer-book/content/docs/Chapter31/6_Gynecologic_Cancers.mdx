## 31.5.1 Cervical Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Cervical cancer incidence has declined significantly in developed countries due to screening programs. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the primary cause.

**Pathology**: Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are the predominant histologic types. The transformation zone is the most common site of origin.

**Treatment**: Treatment depends on stage and includes surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or combinations thereof.

## 31.5.2 Ovarian Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among gynecologic cancers. Most cases are diagnosed at advanced stages.

**Pathology**: Epithelial ovarian cancers represent the majority of cases, with serous adenocarcinoma being the most common subtype.

**Treatment**: Standard treatment involves cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, with maintenance therapy increasingly utilized.

## 31.5.3 Endometrial Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in developed countries. Risk factors include obesity, diabetes, and unopposed estrogen exposure.

**Pathology**: Adenocarcinoma is the predominant histologic type, with molecular classification becoming increasingly important for treatment decisions.

**Treatment**: Surgery is the primary treatment, with adjuvant therapy based on risk factors and molecular features.
