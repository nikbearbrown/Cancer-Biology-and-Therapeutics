## 31.9.1 Personalized Medicine

The era of personalized medicine has transformed cancer care, with molecular profiling increasingly guiding treatment decisions across tumor types. Biomarkers for prognosis, treatment selection, and monitoring response continue to evolve.

## 31.9.2 Multidisciplinary Care

Physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals must work together to streamline the patient's journey, from diagnosis through treatment and follow-up. Coordination minimizes errors, reduces delays, and enhances patient safety, ultimately leading to improved outcomes and patient-centered care.

## 31.9.3 Supportive Care

Comprehensive cancer care extends beyond tumor-directed therapy to include symptom management, psychosocial support, and quality of life considerations. Integration of supportive care throughout the cancer continuum improves patient outcomes.

## 31.9.4 Prevention and Early Detection

Prevention strategies, including lifestyle modifications and vaccination programs, represent the most effective approaches to reducing cancer burden. Screening programs continue to evolve with technological advances and improved risk stratification.
