## 31.3.1 Epidemiology and Natural History

In the United States, colon cancer is diagnosed in approximately 100,000 patients and rectal cancer is diagnosed in another 50,000 each year. These cancers most commonly affect older adults, with 90 percent of cases diagnosed in individuals older than 50 years. Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignant tumor and the fourth most common cause of cancer death in the world.

Most colorectal cancers develop slowly over decades. The process involves a gradual accumulation of genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations. The first histologically detectable change is development of aberrant crypt foci in the lining of the intestine.

## 31.3.2 Pathology and Molecular Features

The pathological histological types mainly include papillary adenocarcinoma, tubular adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, signet-ring cell carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and carcinoid carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma has the highest incidence, accounting for more than 90%.

This process often involves abnormal changes of multiple genes, such as APC, DCC, P53, K-RAS, C-MYC, BRAF, MCC, and MMR-related genes.

## 31.3.3 Staging System

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) 2017 is currently the preferred staging system for colorectal cancer.

**TNM Classification**:
- **T1**: Tumor invades the submucosa (through the muscularis mucosa but not into the muscularis propria)
- **T3**: Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues
- **T4**: Tumor invades the visceral peritoneum or invades or adheres to adjacent organ or structure

## 31.3.4 Prognosis and Treatment

The prognosis for colon cancer depends on the stage. The most important prognostic indicator is the pathological stage, supported by SEER data. The 5-year overall survival rate for colon cancer stage I is 74%, for stage IIA is 66%, for stage IIB is 58%, for stage IIC is 37%, for stage IIIA is 73%, for stage IIIB is 46%, for stage IIIC is 28%, and stage IV is 5%.

The disease stage at initial diagnosis is the most important prognostic indicator of CRC. It has been reported that the 5-year survival rate of patients with localized CRC, who can be surgically resected, is about 90%, while the 5-year survival rate of advanced CRC patients who lose the opportunity of surgical treatment is reduced to about 10%.

## 31.3.5 Screening and Early Detection

Direct evidence from multiple well-conducted randomized trials supports the effectiveness of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) in decreasing colon cancer incidence and reducing mortality from colorectal cancer compared with no screening for average-risk adults over age 50.

Colonoscopy can visually observe the shape, size, and location of colorectal lesions. Most importantly, it can obtain pathological biopsy specimens, which is an important means for CRC screening and diagnosis.
