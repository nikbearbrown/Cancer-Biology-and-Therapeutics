## 31.4.1 Prostate Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Based on the Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine resource, prostate cancer represents one of the most common malignancies in men, with incidence rates varying significantly by age, race, and geographic location.

**Pathology**: The majority of prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas arising from the peripheral zone of the gland. The Gleason grading system remains the standard for histologic assessment.

**Treatment**: Treatment decisions depend on tumor stage, patient age, life expectancy, and comorbidities. Options include active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy.

## 31.4.2 Bladder Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Bladder cancer predominantly affects older adults, with smoking being the primary risk factor. Occupational exposures to certain chemicals also increase risk.

**Pathology**: Transitional cell carcinoma (urothelial carcinoma) represents approximately 90% of bladder cancers. Classification into non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive disease determines treatment approach.

**Treatment**: Non-muscle-invasive disease may be managed with transurethral resection and intravesical therapy, while muscle-invasive disease typically requires radical cystectomy or definitive radiation therapy.

## 31.4.3 Kidney Cancer

**Epidemiology**: Renal cell carcinoma represents the most common kidney cancer in adults, with clear cell carcinoma being the predominant histologic subtype.

**Clinical Presentation**: The classic triad of flank pain, hematuria, and palpable mass is present in less than 20% of cases. Most tumors are now detected incidentally on imaging.

**Treatment**: Surgery remains the primary treatment for localized disease, while systemic therapy with targeted agents has revolutionized the treatment of metastatic disease.
