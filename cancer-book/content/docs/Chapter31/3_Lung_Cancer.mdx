## 31.2.1 Epidemiology and Classification

Lung cancer or bronchogenic carcinoma refers to tumors originating in the lung parenchyma or within the bronchi. It is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Since 1987, lung cancer has been responsible for more deaths in women than breast cancer. Lung cancer is a diagnosis that approximately 230,000 United States citizens will receive annually. Deaths are estimated at 135,000 patients per year.

Lung cancer is histologically divided into 2 main types: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC comprises about 15% of lung cancer while NSCLC comprises approximately 85%.

## 31.2.2 Risk Factors

Approximately 80% of lung cancer cases in men and 90% of cases in women are associated with smoking. SCC is more strongly associated with smoking than any other type of NSCLC. Other risk factors for SCC include age, family history, exposure to second-hand smoke, and exposure to minerals, metal particles, or asbestos.

## 31.2.3 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

**Pathological Subtypes**:
Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common primary lung cancer seen in the United States. It falls under the umbrella of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has a strong association with previous smoking. Adenocarcinoma of the lung usually evolves from the mucosal glands and represents about 40% of all lung cancers.

Adenosquamous carcinomas are lung tumors with more than 10% glandular and squamous components. This is an uncommon and highly aggressive lung tumor, and current recommendations propose adjuvant chemotherapy even in Stage I radically resected tumors.

**Staging and Prognosis**:
Metabolic activity on PET scan has been shown to have a poor prognosis in stages I-IV NSCLC. Recurrence after complete resection has been cited at 41 percent, with the median time to recurrence at 11.5 months and median survival of 8.1 months.

## 31.2.4 Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)

The main criteria for determining LD and ED are whether a reasonable radiation plan can safely encompass disease extent. Two-thirds of patients present with extensive stage or metastatic disease.

Close to 70% of patients with small cell lung cancer have disseminated disease at the time of presentation.

## 31.2.5 Treatment Approaches

**NSCLC Treatment**:
Treatment varies based on the patient's functional status, comorbidities, tumor stage, and molecular characteristics of the disease. Patients who have stage I, II, or III NSCLC are treated with the intent to cure. This can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT), or a combined modality approach.

Surgery is the treatment for patients with stage I to stage IIIA adenocarcinoma of the lung. Lobectomy or a pneumonectomy are often performed. Since these patients have a high risk of relapse, adjuvant chemotherapy is now standard.

**SCLC Treatment**:
Patients with extensive-stage disease are treated with chemotherapy with radiation (RT) reserved for select candidates and palliation.
