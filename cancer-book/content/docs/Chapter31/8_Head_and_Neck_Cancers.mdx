## 31.7.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Head and neck cancers represent a diverse group of malignancies arising from the mucosa of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and paranasal sinuses. Tobacco and alcohol use are the primary risk factors, with human papillomavirus (HPV) emerging as an important cause of oropharyngeal cancers.

## 31.7.2 Pathology

Squamous cell carcinoma represents approximately 90% of head and neck cancers. HPV-positive tumors have distinct molecular features and improved prognosis compared to HPV-negative tumors.

## 31.7.3 Treatment

Treatment typically involves multimodal approaches combining surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Organ preservation strategies are increasingly emphasized when feasible.
