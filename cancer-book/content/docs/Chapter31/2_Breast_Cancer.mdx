## 31.1.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women and the second most common cause of death from cancer among women worldwide. As of 2020, breast cancer has become the most diagnosed cancer globally, overtaking lung and prostate cancers. In the UK, breast cancer represents almost a third of all newly diagnosed cancers, with a crude incidence rate of 76.3 per 100,000 persons, though all except 287 cases were found in women.

Most breast cancer is sporadic (90%-95%), with only 5% to 10% of patients having an identifiable genetic mutation. BRCA 1 and 2 are the most common associated genetic conditions. There are no pathognomonic features distinguishing breast and ovarian cancers occurring in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants from those occurring in noncarriers.

## 31.1.2 Pathology and Molecular Subtypes

Invasive ductal and invasive lobular carcinoma are the most common pathologic forms of invasive breast cancer. Carcinogenesis occurs due to a complex interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors, hormonal influences, and patient-related factors.

The molecular classification of breast cancer has revolutionized treatment approaches:

**Luminal A**: Hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 negative

**Luminal B**: Hormone receptor-positive, HER-2 positive

**HER2-enriched**: HER-2 enriched tumors are more aggressive, with a poor prognosis without targeted therapy

**Triple-negative**: TNBC is defined as the absence of staining for ER, PR, and HER2/neu. TNBC is insensitive to some of the most effective therapies available for breast cancer treatment including HER2-directed therapy such as trastuzumab and endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen or the aromatase inhibitors.

## 31.1.3 Staging and Prognosis

Breast cancer staging is determined clinically and histologically. Clinical breast cancer staging is based on physical examination and imaging studies before treatment. Histopathologic breast cancer staging is determined by pathologic examination of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes after definitive surgical treatment.

The Pathological Prognostic Stage Group table is used for all patients in the United States who have surgery as initial treatment and have pathological T and N information reported.

## 31.1.4 Treatment Approaches

Breast cancer treatment is nuanced and based on various factors, including the disease stage, pathology, patient preference, and available resources. In general, breast cancer management approaches are divided into early breast cancer, locally advanced breast cancer, and metastatic breast cancer treatment.

**Early Breast Cancer**: Early breast cancer includes tumors &lt;5 cm in size without clinically positive lymph nodes. Treatment involves surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and hormonal therapy, depending on the stage and molecular profile.

**Surgical Options**: Surgical treatment: Options to excise the primary tumor include breast conservation surgery (eg, partial mastectomy or lumpectomy) or a total mastectomy.

**Systemic Therapy**: Combination cytotoxic chemotherapy administered in a dose-dense or metronomic schedule remains the standard therapy for early-stage TNBC.
