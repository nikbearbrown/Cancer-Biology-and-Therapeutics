title: 27.1 Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery

---



Nanotechnology has emerged as a transformative approach in cancer treatment, offering unprecedented opportunities to overcome the limitations of conventional therapeutic modalities. Cancer nanotherapeutics are rapidly progressing and are being implemented to solve several limitations of conventional drug delivery systems such as nonspecific biodistribution and targeting, lack of water solubility, poor oral bioavailability, and low therapeutic indices.

## 27.1.1 Fundamentals of Nanoparticle Drug Delivery

**Enhanced Permeability and Retention Effect**

Nanoparticles exploit the unique pathophysiology of tumors, particularly the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. This phenomenon arises from:

* **Abnormal tumor vasculature**: Tumor blood vessels are typically more permeable than normal vessels due to incomplete endothelial cell junctions and reduced pericyte coverage
* **Defective lymphatic drainage**: Impaired lymphatic function in tumors leads to reduced clearance of extravasated materials
* **Size-dependent accumulation**: Nanoparticles in the optimal size range (10-150 nm) can extravasate through leaky tumor vasculature while being retained in the tumor microenvironment

**Passive vs. Active Targeting**

*Passive Targeting*:
* Relies on the EPR effect for tumor accumulation
* Size and surface characteristics determine circulation time and biodistribution
* Stealth properties achieved through polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating to evade immune recognition

*Active Targeting*:
* Employs specific ligands or antibodies directed against tumor-specific receptors
* Amplifies specificity of therapeutic nanoparticles
* Enhances cellular uptake and internalization by cancer cells

## 27.1.2 Types of Nanoparticle Drug Delivery Systems

**Liposomal Drug Delivery Systems**

Liposomes are lipid spheres about 100 nanometers in diameter that have been synthesized for improved delivery of therapeutic agents. They offer several advantages:

* **Biocompatibility**: Composed of naturally occurring lipids
* **Versatile drug loading**: Can encapsulate both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs
* **Controlled release**: Permit continued drug release with increased precision in tumor-targeting
* **Reduced toxicity**: Demonstrated clinical success in reducing systemic toxicity

*Clinical Applications*:
Liposomes have been used to encapsulate anticancer drugs for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. In melanoma models, phosphatidylethanolamine liposomal cisplatin was proven to have higher cytotoxicity than classic liposomes or free cisplatin, maintaining high intratumoral drug concentration for 72 hours and efficiently delivering 3.6-times more drug compared to the free drug.

**Polymeric Nanoparticles**

Polymeric nanoparticles (PNs) are molecules usually organized with tunable size into a dense structure with entangling biodegradable polymers presenting thermodynamic stability in an aqueous solvent. The FDA has approved three PNs: polylactic acid (PLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and polycaprolactone (PCL).

*Advantages*:
* Controlled drug release kinetics
* Biodegradable and biocompatible
* Tunable surface properties through copolymer modification
* Protection of encapsulated drugs from degradation

*PEGylation Strategy*:
Copolymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been used to reduce degradation rate and improve biocompatibility, creating PLA-PEG and PLGA-PEG formulations that evade immune response and extend circulation time.

**Carbon-Based Nanoparticles**

Carbon-based nanoparticles are effective in melanoma cells. A single-walled carbon nanotube loaded with doxorubicin induced melanoma cell death in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and reduced tumor development in a xenograft melanoma model.

*Properties*:
* High surface area for drug loading
* Excellent electrical and thermal conductivity
* Potential for photothermal therapy applications
* Challenges with biocompatibility and clearance

**Inorganic Nanoparticles**

*Gold Nanoparticles (GNPs)*:
Gold nanoparticles are known as nontoxic, highly stable, easy to synthesize, and minimally interfering with the biological profile of melanoma tumor cells. Being of high atomic number and electron density, GNPs are optimal contrast agents for computed tomography.

*Magnetic Nanoparticles*:
* Iron oxide nanoparticles for MRI contrast enhancement
* Potential for magnetic hyperthermia therapy
* Targeted delivery using external magnetic fields

## 27.1.3 Overcoming Drug Resistance

**Mechanisms of Drug Resistance**

The mechanisms of cancer drug resistance include overexpression of drug efflux transporters, defective apoptotic pathways, and hypoxic environment. Nanoparticles targeting these mechanisms can lead to an improvement in the reversal of multidrug resistance.

**Nanoparticle-Based Solutions**

*Bypassing Efflux Pumps*:
* Nanoparticles can deliver drugs directly to intracellular compartments
* Endocytic uptake bypasses membrane transporters
* Co-delivery of efflux pump inhibitors

*Targeting Resistant Cell Populations*:
* Combination therapy delivery systems
* Targeting cancer stem cells with specific ligands
* Delivery to hypoxic tumor regions

## 27.1.4 Clinical Translation and Challenges

**Approved Nanotherapeutics**

There are five clinically approved nanoparticle chemotherapeutics for cancer and many more under clinical investigation. These include:
* Doxil (liposomal doxorubicin)
* Abraxane (albumin-bound paclitaxel nanoparticles)
* DaunoXome (liposomal daunorubicin)

**Challenges in Clinical Development**

*Biological Barriers*:
The main limitations of nanodrug efficacy are the immunological interactions, the biological barriers that hinder the availability of nanodrugs to the intended target, and the heterogeneity of the biological target.

*Bio-Corona Formation*:
In the biological system, nanomaterials interact with all the encountered biomolecules and dynamically form the so called "bio-corona." The commonly agreed definition of the bio-corona is the multitude and the variety of biomolecules that associate with the surface of a nanoparticle when introduced in a biological system.
