title: 17.1 Primary Prevention - Lifestyle Modifications, Vaccinations
---



Primary prevention represents the most desirable strategy for reducing cancer burden by keeping individuals from developing cancer in the first place. The most desirable strategy for the amelioration of suffering from cancer is primary prevention, a public health approach which keeps people from acquiring cancer in the first place. While the fundamental etiologies of cancer are not fully understood, substantial evidence supports the role of modifiable risk factors in cancer development.

## 17.1.1 Modifiable Risk Factors and Lifestyle Interventions

Much of the burden of cancer in the United States can be traced to modifiable health behaviors that increase one's risk of disease. The major lifestyle factors that contribute significantly to cancer incidence include tobacco use, physical inactivity, overweight and obesity, poor diet, and alcohol consumption. These factors not only increase cancer risk but also contribute to other chronic diseases, making their modification particularly beneficial for overall health.

### Tobacco Control: The Single Most Important Prevention Strategy

Tobacco is the scourge of public health. In the United States alone, tobacco use, primarily in the form of cigarette smoking, causes more than 440,000 premature deaths from cancer and other causes each year and is responsible for approximately 30 percent of all cancer-related deaths. The causal relationship between tobacco use and multiple cancer types has been firmly established through decades of research.

**Key Evidence:**
- Tobacco accounts for approximately 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States
- Worldwide, tobacco-related deaths are expected to double by 2020, reaching approximately 8 million deaths annually
- Helping the 23.5 percent of adults who smoke cigarettes discontinue their habit and preventing youth from adopting the habit of tobacco use will save more lives than the sum of all the incremental benefits of improving cancer screening rates or cancer treatments.

**Intervention Strategies:**
- Comprehensive tobacco control programs combining policy, education, and clinical interventions
- Smoking cessation programs with behavioral counseling and pharmacological support
- Youth prevention programs targeting initiation
- Environmental policies including smoke-free laws and taxation

### Nutrition and Physical Activity

One-third of cancer deaths are thought to be related to nutrition and other lifestyle factors including body weight, physical activity, and food choices. The evidence linking diet, physical activity, and body weight to cancer risk has grown substantially, leading to specific recommendations for cancer prevention.

**Dietary Factors:**
- Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables may reduce risk for several cancer types
- Limitation of processed and red meat consumption
- Reduction of alcohol intake
- Maintenance of adequate fiber intake
- Limitation of high-energy foods with excessive fat, sugar, and salt

**Physical Activity and Body Weight:**
- Regular physical activity reduces risk for multiple cancer types
- Maintenance of healthy body weight throughout life
- The WCRF/AICR recommendations... highlighting the importance of maintaining a healthy body weight through appropriate levels of physical activity and a balanced diet, predominantly based on plant foods, with no more than modest amounts of meat and dairy, and limiting the amounts of processed meat, salt, and alcohol.

### Infectious Agent Prevention and Vaccination

Several cancers are directly linked to infectious agents, providing opportunities for prevention through vaccination and infection control measures.

**Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination:**
- Prevents cervical, anal, oropharyngeal, and other cancers
- Most effective when administered before sexual activity begins
- We have an opportunity through the development of cancer vaccines and the cervical cancer vaccine trials that are underway to be able to eliminate disease by a preventative interventional strategy.

**Hepatitis B Vaccination:**
- Prevents hepatocellular carcinoma
- Particularly important in endemic areas
- Part of routine childhood immunization schedules in many countries

**Other Infectious Disease Prevention:**
- Helicobacter pylori eradication to reduce gastric cancer risk
- Safe sexual practices to reduce transmission of oncogenic viruses
- Blood safety measures to prevent hepatitis and HIV transmission

## 17.1.2 Environmental and Occupational Exposures

Primary prevention also encompasses reducing exposure to environmental carcinogens and implementing workplace safety measures.

**Key Environmental Factors:**
- Ultraviolet radiation exposure and skin cancer prevention
- Radon exposure reduction in homes
- Air pollution reduction
- Occupational carcinogen exposure control
- Chemical safety in consumer products

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Regulatory policies limiting exposure to known carcinogens
- Personal protective measures (sunscreen, protective clothing)
- Environmental monitoring and remediation
- Occupational health and safety programs
