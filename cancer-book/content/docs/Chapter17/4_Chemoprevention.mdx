title: 17.3 Chemoprevention
---



Chemoprevention represents a distinct approach to cancer prevention through the use of natural or synthetic agents to prevent, delay, or reverse carcinogenesis.

## 17.3.1 Definition and Rationale

Chemoprevention is the use of substances to lower the risk of cancer, or keep it from recurring. The substances may be natural or made in the laboratory. This approach is based on the understanding that cancer develops through a multi-step process that can potentially be interrupted at various stages.

**Categories of Chemopreventive Agents:**
Agents for chemoprevention of cancer fall into two principal categories: (a) those that prevent the mutagenic initiation of the carcinogenic process ("blocking" agents) and (b) those that prevent the further promotion or progression of lesions that have already been established ("suppressing" agents).

## 17.3.2 Established Chemopreventive Agents

### Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs)

**Tamoxifen:**
Strong, direct evidence shows that tamoxifen reduces by approximately half the incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer.

- FDA-approved for breast cancer risk reduction in high-risk women
- 49% reduction in invasive breast cancer incidence
- Benefits must be weighed against risks including endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events

**Raloxifene:**
Evidence from one study suggests that raloxifene reduces by the same amount the incidence of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at low to average risk for breast cancer.

- Approved for breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women
- Does not increase endometrial cancer risk
- Provides additional bone health benefits

### 5Î±-Reductase Inhibitors

**Finasteride:**
We have established at least proof of principle that chemoprevention in an area such as prostate cancer is achievable, with a 25 percent reduction in incidence.

- 25% reduction in prostate cancer incidence in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial
- Concerns about potential increase in high-grade tumors
- Benefits and risks require careful consideration

### Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

**Aspirin:**
Aspirin has been studied extensively as a chemopreventive agent. However, the evidence of benefit for the prevention of cancer or cancer deaths in the general population is mixed, but generally negative.

- Both case-control and cohort studies show a reduced risk for colorectal cancer after prolonged use of aspirin.
- Potential benefits for colorectal cancer prevention in specific populations
- Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding must be considered
- Before beginning long-term aspirin use, it is important to talk with your doctor about the related benefits and harms.

## 17.3.3 Investigational Approaches

### Antioxidants and Vitamins

The results of large-scale trials testing antioxidant supplements have been largely disappointing:

None of the RCTs of primary chemoprevention showed the interventions tested to be effective in preventing lung cancer. In two trials in smokers, beta-carotene was associated with a statistically-significant increased incidence of lung cancer.

**Key Findings:**
- Beta-carotene supplements increased lung cancer risk in smokers
- Vitamin E and selenium trials showed no benefit for most cancers
- Complex interactions between nutrients and cancer risk

### Novel Agents Under Investigation

If chemoprevention is truly to have a practical impact on the control of cancer, it will be necessary to develop a fundamentally pharmacologic approach to the problem.

**Promising Areas:**
- COX-2 inhibitors for colorectal cancer prevention
- Retinoids for skin and head/neck cancer prevention
- Calcium and vitamin D for colorectal cancer
- Metformin for multiple cancer types

## 17.3.4 Challenges in Chemoprevention

### Risk-Benefit Considerations

Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduce the incidence of breast cancer in women over a wide range of ages and levels of breast cancer risk. Both drugs may also have other benefits, but they may cause harm in otherwise healthy women who take them for prophylaxis.

**Key Challenges:**
- Administering active agents to healthy individuals
- Long-term safety considerations
- Individual risk assessment and counseling
- Cost-effectiveness of intervention

### Target Population Selection

Some chemopreventive agents are tested in people who are at high risk for a certain type of cancer. The risk may be because of a precancerous condition, family history, or lifestyle factors.

**Considerations for Target Selection:**
- Genetic predisposition (BRCA mutations, Lynch syndrome)
- Precancerous lesions (colonic polyps, ductal carcinoma in situ)
- Environmental exposures
- Age and life expectancy
