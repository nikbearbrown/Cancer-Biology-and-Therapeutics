Cancer prevention and screening represent fundamental pillars in the comprehensive strategy to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. These approaches operate through distinct mechanisms: primary prevention aims to prevent cancer from occurring altogether, while secondary prevention seeks to detect cancer or precancerous lesions at early, more treatable stages. This chapter examines evidence-based strategies across the prevention spectrum, from lifestyle modifications and vaccination to organized screening programs and chemoprevention.
