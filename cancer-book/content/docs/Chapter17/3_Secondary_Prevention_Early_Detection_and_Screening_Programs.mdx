title: 17.2 Secondary Prevention - Early Detection and Screening Programs
---



A complementary strategy to preventing the occurrence of cancer (primary prevention) is early detection of cancer through screening (secondary prevention). The fundamental tenet of screening for cancer is that finding the disease before symptoms develop enables detection at a less advanced stage and that instituting treatment at that time leads ultimately to improved health outcomes.

## 17.2.1 Principles of Cancer Screening

**Definition and Goals:**
Cancer screening markers are defined as tests... When systematically applied to populations, they identify asymptomatic individuals at sufficient risk of cancer to justify use of additional markers or clinical intervention. The goal is to detect malignant disease or precancerous lesions at stages when existing clinical interventions are most effective.

**Essential Characteristics of Effective Screening:**
1. **High Sensitivity:** Ability to detect disease when present (high true-positive rate)
2. **High Specificity:** Ability to correctly identify those without disease (low false-positive rate)
3. **Positive Predictive Value:** Proportion of positive tests that are truly positive
4. **Accessibility:** Tests must be feasible for population-based application
5. **Cost-effectiveness:** Benefits must outweigh costs and potential harms

## 17.2.2 Evidence-Based Screening Programs

### Breast Cancer Screening

Multiple randomized studies have established that routine screening mammography should be offered to women aged 50 to 69. Recent guidelines have expanded recommendations to include earlier screening initiation.

**Current Recommendations:**
- The latest guidelines from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) now advocate starting routine mammograms at age 40.
- Biennial screening is considered reasonable, particularly for women 55 and older
- Screening continuation until life expectancy is less than 10 years

**Impact:**
- From 1989 to 2015, breast cancer mortality dropped by 39%. The mortality rate among women aged 50 and older has continued to decline since 2007.
- Most breast cancers are now diagnosed at stage I, with 100% five-year survival rate

### Cervical Cancer Screening

Cervical cancer screening represents one of the most successful cancer prevention programs, demonstrating the potential for dramatic impact on cancer mortality.

**Historical Impact:**
Cervical cancer mortality, which was a leading cause of cancer death of women in America (and is still the leading cause of cancer death in women in most other parts of the world), is now controlled for most women in this country, and could be eradicated if we could solve the access problem.

**Screening Methods:**
- Papanicolaou (Pap) cytology testing
- HPV DNA testing
- Co-testing strategies combining cytology and HPV testing

### Colorectal Cancer Screening

The Minnesota trial demonstrated that annual and biennial screening by FOBT reduced the mortality rates by 33 percent and 21 percent, respectively... screening also reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, for the annually and biennially screened groups.

**Screening Modalities:**
- Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT)
- Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT)
- Colonoscopy
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy
- CT colonography

**Dual Benefits:**
This suggests that, in addition to secondary prevention (early detection of cancer), FOBT also achieves primary prevention (preventing the occurrence of cancer), presumably by leading those screened to colonoscopy, thus facilitating the detection (and removal) of premalignant polyps.

### Lung Cancer Screening

Recent evidence supports lung cancer screening in high-risk populations, particularly heavy smokers.

**Target Population:**
- Adults aged 50-80 years with significant smoking history
- Current smokers or those who quit within the past 15 years
- Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening

**Considerations:**
- The impact the national lung screening trial could have through just one intervention such as a radiological technique.
- Balance between benefits and risks of radiation exposure
- Importance of smoking cessation counseling concurrent with screening

## 17.2.3 Emerging Technologies in Cancer Screening

### Multi-Cancer Early Detection Tests

Multi-cancer early detection technologies aim to provide a new approach to complement traditional cancer screening programs. These tests examine genetic signals within blood samples with next-generation sequencing and computational algorithms to assess the presence and type of different cancers.

**Advantages:**
- Because multi-cancer early detection technologies rely on blood samples, their simplicity may offer several advantages for screening that could potentially improve accessibility, reduce test discomfort, and reach a greater number of people when complemented with traditional screening tests.
- Potential to detect cancers without established screening programs
- May help overcome barriers to traditional screening methods

**Current Status:**
- Several tests in development and clinical evaluation
- Need for large-scale validation studies to establish clinical utility
- Regulatory approval processes ongoing

## 17.2.4 Challenges and Limitations of Screening

### Potential Harms of Screening

The benefits of early detection of cancer must be weighed not only against the harms of screening but also against the harms of treatment.

**Key Concerns:**
1. **False-positive results:** Leading to unnecessary anxiety and additional testing
2. **Overdiagnosis:** Detection of cancers that would never have caused symptoms
3. **False-negative results:** Missing cancers, providing false reassurance
4. **Opportunity costs:** The diversion of attention, time, and resources away from the primary prevention of cancer and other measures with greater health benefit to patients than screening.

### Implementation Challenges

Screening programs can effectively reduce the burden of cancer if they ensure that people get the tests that they need and that tests are performed accurately, are not conducted too often, and are followed up in a timely and appropriate manner.

**System-Level Challenges:**
- Ensuring access to screening across diverse populations
- Maintaining quality control in screening programs
- Developing effective follow-up systems for abnormal results
- Addressing disparities in screening participation
