title: 19.3 Personalized Medicine - Tailoring Treatment to the Individual
---


The evolution toward personalized medicine represents a fundamental shift from treating cancer based solely on anatomical site and histology to incorporating molecular characteristics, patient factors, and individual preferences into treatment decisions.

## 19.3.1 Foundations of Personalized Medicine

**Conceptual Framework:**
Every patient is unique, and the evolving field of precision medicine aims to ensure the delivery of the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. Treatment previously based on the anatomic origin of cancer (e.g., lung, breast, colon, prostate) is being expanded to include the use of genomic tests to stratify patients into subsets based on the specific molecular drivers of their individual tumors.

**Precision Medicine Definition:**
The vision for a New Taxonomy informed by the proposed "Knowledge Network" shares some similarities with the widely discussed concept of "Personalized Medicine," recently defined by the President's Council on Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) as "the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient... to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment."

## 19.3.2 Molecular Profiling and Targeted Therapy

### Genomic Medicine Implementation

**Clinical Applications:**
Oncology has been at the forefront of advances in precision medicine, primarily due to the genomic nature of cancer: "Most cancers harbor a cocktail of mutated (or otherwise altered) oncogenes and tumor suppressors that work in concert to specify the molecular pathways that lead to their genesis, maintenance, and progression."

**Actionable Alterations:**
For several major tumor types, including melanoma and breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, and brain cancers, about half of those tumors harbor at least one identifiable genetic alteration that fosters tumor growth or survival and is "actionable." An actionable alteration is one that can be targeted by approved or experimental drugs, or one that suggests the inappropriateness of treatment using certain approaches.

### Biomarker-Driven Treatment Selection

**Treatment Matching:**
This is one of the largest ever personalised medicine trials in any cancer, one which attempts to match the right treatment to the right patient based on an in-depth understanding of what makes their own cancer cells grow and survive.

**Clinical Implementation:**
- **Companion diagnostics:** Tests that identify patients likely to benefit from specific therapies
- **Tumor sequencing:** Comprehensive genomic profiling to identify therapeutic targets
- **Liquid biopsies:** Non-invasive monitoring of tumor evolution and treatment response
- **Molecular tumor boards:** Expert review of genomic findings for treatment recommendations

## 19.3.3 Patient-Specific Factors

### Individual Risk Assessment

**Multifactorial Considerations:**
Personalized treatment decisions must integrate tumor characteristics with patient-specific factors including:
- **Performance status:** Functional capacity and ability to tolerate treatment
- **Comorbidities:** Concurrent medical conditions affecting treatment selection
- **Age and life expectancy:** Balancing treatment benefits with remaining lifespan
- **Previous treatments:** Prior therapy history and resistance patterns

### Treatment Tolerance and Toxicity Prediction

**Pharmacogenomics:**
Understanding individual variations in drug metabolism and response enables optimization of dosing and selection of therapies with improved efficacy and reduced toxicity.

**Predictive Factors:**
- **Genetic polymorphisms:** Variations affecting drug metabolism
- **Organ function:** Kidney, liver, and cardiac status
- **Drug interactions:** Concurrent medications and supplements
- **Nutritional status:** Impact on treatment tolerance and outcomes

## 19.3.4 Adaptive Treatment Strategies

### Dynamic Treatment Planning

**Tumor Evolution Recognition:**
The continuous biological changes in the neoplastic cell population represent an essential characteristic of each neoplasm, with infinite possibilities of transformation. The heterogeneity of neoplastic cells is a property that is amplified with the evolution of cancer disease.

**Response-Adapted Therapy:**
- **Early response assessment:** Modification of treatment based on initial response
- **Resistance monitoring:** Detection of acquired resistance mechanisms
- **Sequential therapy:** Planned treatment sequences based on expected resistance patterns
- **Combination strategies:** Rational drug combinations to prevent resistance

### Precision Medicine Clinical Trials

**Innovative Trial Designs:**
Presented by the trial website as 'the largest precision medicine trial in non-small cell lung cancer globally', Matrix involves a rolling programme of recruitment to treatment arms which can close and open as knowledge about the effectiveness of drugs develops through the research.

**Adaptive Trials:**
- **Master protocols:** Single trials testing multiple targeted agents
- **Umbrella trials:** Multiple substudies within a single cancer type
- **Basket trials:** Single targeted therapy across multiple cancer types
- **Platform trials:** Perpetual trials with adding and dropping of arms

## 19.3.5 Challenges and Future Directions

### Implementation Challenges

**Economic Considerations:**
Recent reports suggest that in one of the largest markets, the USA, spending on cancer drugs in the genomic era has increased dramatically â€“ rising from $26 billion in 2012 to more than $45 billion in 2016, with targeted therapies accounting for 60 per cent of this increase.

**Access and Equity:**
- **Cost barriers:** High prices of personalized therapies
- **Geographic disparities:** Unequal access to molecular testing and targeted therapies
- **Health system capacity:** Infrastructure requirements for precision medicine
- **Insurance coverage:** Reimbursement challenges for novel diagnostics and therapies

### Scientific Limitations

**Clinical Efficacy Questions:**
The promise of personalised or precision medicine for cancer is contested in medicine, science and beyond in the public sphere because of concerns about efficacy and cost in particular... overall survival from 71 targeted cancer therapies approved by the FDA between 2002 and 2014 was only 2.1 months.

**Complexity Challenges:**
The consequences of heterogeneity, clonal evolution and the influence of the host response are that simple genetic tests are much less accurate in predicting prognosis and treatment response than was expected based on the CML imatinib paradigm.

## 19.3.6 Future Directions

### Emerging Technologies

**Artificial Intelligence Integration:**
- **Pattern recognition:** Machine learning for treatment response prediction
- **Drug discovery:** AI-driven identification of novel therapeutic targets
- **Clinical decision support:** Algorithmic assistance in treatment selection
- **Outcome prediction:** Predictive modeling for personalized prognosis

### Expanding Precision Medicine

**Broader Applications:**
The tailoring of treatment to specific molecular targets is being applied to other diseases and conditions, including cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

**Comprehensive Profiling:**
- **Multi-omics integration:** Combining genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data
- **Microenvironment analysis:** Understanding tumor-immune interactions
- **Pharmacokinetic modeling:** Personalized dosing strategies
- **Quality of life metrics:** Individual optimization of treatment tolerability
