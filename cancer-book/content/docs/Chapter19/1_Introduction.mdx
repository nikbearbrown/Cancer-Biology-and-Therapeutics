Cancer therapy has evolved from crude surgical interventions to sophisticated, molecularly-targeted treatments that offer unprecedented precision in attacking malignant cells while sparing normal tissues. This transformation reflects our growing understanding of cancer biology and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Understanding the fundamental principles that guide cancer treatment decisions is essential for healthcare professionals involved in cancer care, as these principles inform treatment selection, sequencing, and integration of multiple therapeutic modalities.
