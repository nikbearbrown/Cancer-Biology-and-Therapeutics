title: 19.1 Goals of Cancer Treatment
---


The primary goal of cancer therapy varies significantly based on the stage of disease, tumor characteristics, patient factors, and available therapeutic options. Understanding these goals is fundamental to making appropriate treatment decisions and setting realistic expectations for patients and families.

## 19.1.1 Curative Treatment

**Definition and Objectives:**
Cancer treatment is the series of interventions, including psychosocial support, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy, that is aimed at curing the disease or prolonging the patient's life considerably (for several years) while improving the patient's quality of life.

**Characteristics of Curative Care:**
Cure is defined as the attainment of normal life expectancy and has three important components: recovery from all evidence of disease (complete remission); attainment of a stage of minimal or no risk of recurrence or relapse; restoration of functional health (physical, developmental and psychosocial).

**Curable Cancers:**
Curable cancers are cancers for which treatment can give patients a high potential for being disease free in the 10 years following cessation of treatment. These typically include:
- Early-stage solid tumors amenable to complete surgical resection
- Localized cancers responsive to radiation therapy
- Hematologic malignancies responsive to chemotherapy
- Certain pediatric cancers with high cure rates

**Treatment Approaches for Curative Intent:**
- **Surgery:** Complete resection of the primary tumor with adequate margins
- **Radiation therapy:** High-dose radiation to eradicate localized disease
- **Systemic therapy:** Chemotherapy or targeted therapy to eliminate micrometastatic disease
- **Multimodal therapy:** Combination of treatment modalities to maximize cure probability

## 19.1.2 Life-Prolonging Treatment

**Rationale and Application:**
When cure is not achievable, the focus shifts to prolonging survival while maintaining quality of life. This approach is appropriate for patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease where complete eradication is not possible but meaningful disease control can be achieved.

**Treatment Strategies:**
- **Disease stabilization:** Preventing tumor progression for extended periods
- **Tumor response:** Achieving partial or complete responses to extend survival
- **Metastatic control:** Managing disseminated disease to prolong life
- **Combination approaches:** Sequential or concurrent use of multiple therapies

**Success Metrics:**
- **Overall survival:** Extension of life expectancy beyond natural history
- **Progression-free survival:** Time to disease progression or death
- **Time to treatment failure:** Duration of benefit from specific therapies
- **Quality-adjusted survival:** Meaningful life extension with acceptable toxicity

## 19.1.3 Palliative Treatment

**Fundamental Principles:**
The World Health Organization characterizes the field of palliative care as a form of specialized medical care that aims to optimize the quality of life and alleviate the suffering of patients. The goal of palliative care is to improve the quality of life of patients who have a serious or life-threatening disease.

**WHO Definition:**
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines palliative care in cancer as the "active total care of patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment." The definition is extended in an important way with the statement, "Many aspects of palliative care are also applicable earlier in the course of the illness, in conjunction with anticancer treatment."

**Key Components of Palliative Care:**
- **Symptom management:** Control of pain, nausea, dyspnea, fatigue, and other distressing symptoms
- **Psychosocial support:** Addressing emotional, social, and spiritual needs
- **Quality of life optimization:** Maintaining function and comfort
- **Family support:** Caring for caregivers and loved ones
- **End-of-life care:** Ensuring comfort and dignity during dying process

**Total Pain Concept:**
Dame Cicely Saunders, considered the founder of both the modern hospice movement and the field of PC, developed and propagated the clinical practice around her concept of "Total Pain." Total Pain refers to the comprehensive, multifaceted experience of suffering associated with serious illness, which Saunders further divided into four domains: physical, emotional, social, and spiritual.

## 19.1.4 Preventive and Supportive Treatment

**Preventive Interventions:**
- **Adjuvant therapy:** Treatment given after primary therapy to eliminate residual disease
- **Neoadjuvant therapy:** Treatment given before primary therapy to improve outcomes
- **Prophylactic therapy:** Prevention of complications or secondary malignancies

**Supportive Care Integration:**
Supportive care is the multidisciplinary holistic care offered to all patients and their carers throughout the pathway to help them cope with cancer and treatment of it. It includes issues such as information giving, symptom control and psychological, social and spiritual support.

## 19.1.5 Goal Setting and Communication

**Importance of Clear Goals:**
Patients and oncologists frequently do not share an understanding of the goals of cancer treatment. One group of researchers reported that in 25% of the advanced-cancer patientâ€“physician dyads surveyed, the patient thought the goal of care was to cure disease when it was not.

**Effective Goal Communication:**
- **Honest prognostic discussions:** Sharing realistic expectations about outcomes
- **Shared decision-making:** Involving patients in treatment goal determination
- **Regular reassessment:** Adapting goals as disease status changes
- **Family involvement:** Including loved ones in goal-setting conversations
