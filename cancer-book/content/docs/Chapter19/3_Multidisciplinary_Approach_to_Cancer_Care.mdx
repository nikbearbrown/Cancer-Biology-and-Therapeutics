title: 19.2 Multidisciplinary Approach to Cancer Care
---


Modern cancer care requires coordination among multiple specialists and healthcare professionals to deliver optimal outcomes. The complexity of cancer treatment necessitates expertise from various disciplines working in concert to address all aspects of patient care.

## 19.2.1 Principles of Multidisciplinary Care

**Fundamental Philosophy:**
Most cancer patients, and society in general, would like to think that the entire team of doctors, nurses, and specialists are cooperatively involved in solving their medical problems. The keystone for a successful interdisciplinary management team is attitude: humility, tolerance, adaptability, and appreciation for alternative approaches.

**Team Interdependence:**
None of us is so skilled that he or she can be as expert in every discipline as a highly competent exponent of that particular specialty. No one is omniscient. We are, and must be, interdependent, so it is important to work with individuals who are trustworthy and friendly.

**Benefits of Multidisciplinary Care:**
- **Comprehensive expertise:** Access to specialized knowledge across disciplines
- **Coordinated treatment planning:** Integration of multiple therapeutic modalities
- **Quality improvement:** Enhanced decision-making through collective input
- **Patient advocacy:** Multiple perspectives ensuring optimal patient care

## 19.2.2 Core Team Members

### Medical Oncology

**Role and Responsibilities:**
Medical oncologists provide expertise in systemic therapies including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapy. They often serve as the primary coordinator of care for cancer patients throughout the treatment continuum.

**Key Functions:**
- **Treatment planning:** Selection of appropriate systemic therapies
- **Toxicity management:** Monitoring and managing treatment-related side effects
- **Disease monitoring:** Assessing treatment response and disease progression
- **Supportive care:** Coordinating symptom management and quality of life interventions

### Surgical Oncology

**Fundamental Role:**
Surgery is the oldest modality of cancer therapy and still forms the mainstay of treatment in solid tumors. It remains a paradigm that more patients are cured by surgery when it is used as a single treatment in comparison with any other individual form of cancer therapy.

**Surgical Oncologist Responsibilities:**
The cancer surgeon is commonly charged with the responsibility to establish a tissue diagnosis for a suspicious lesion... The cancer surgeon will usually bear the responsibility for communicating the biopsy findings to the patient, completing the procedures needed to stage the patient's disease, and planning and executing the definitive surgical treatment.

**Evolving Surgical Approaches:**
During the past two decades, major improvements in both operative technique and the use of combined modality therapy have significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with the surgical treatment of solid neoplasms.

### Radiation Oncology

**Treatment Applications:**
Radiation therapy serves multiple roles in cancer care, from definitive treatment of localized disease to palliative management of symptoms. Radiation oncologists work closely with other team members to integrate radiation therapy into comprehensive treatment plans.

**Clinical Applications:**
- **Curative radiation:** High-dose treatment for localized cancers
- **Adjuvant radiation:** Post-operative treatment to reduce recurrence risk
- **Neoadjuvant radiation:** Pre-operative treatment to improve surgical outcomes
- **Palliative radiation:** Symptom relief in advanced disease

### Pathology

**Diagnostic Foundation:**
Pathologists are physicians who are concerned primarily with the study of disease in all its aspects; that is, causation, diagnosis, pathogenesis, mechanisms, natural history, anatomic and biochemical features, progression, and prognosis.

**Critical Role in Treatment Planning:**
Pathological diagnosis provides the foundation for all cancer treatment decisions, including histologic type, grade, stage, and molecular characteristics that guide therapy selection.

## 19.2.3 Supportive Care Specialists

### Palliative Care Team

**Team Composition:**
A palliative team is comprised of a wide array of professionals, including the palliative physician, nurse, social worker, chaplain, and pharmacist.

**Palliative Care Integration:**
Palliative care is appropriate at any age and at any stage in a serious illness and is provided along with curative treatment. Thus, the provision of PC is based on the needs of the patient, not on the patient's prognosis.

### Rehabilitation Team

**Cancer Rehabilitation Goals:**
Cancer rehabilitation can be broadly defined as the maximum restoration of physical, psychologic, social, vocational, recreational, and economic functions within the limits imposed by the malignancy and its treatment.

**Interdisciplinary Rehabilitation Team:**
An integral part of such programs is an interdisciplinary cancer rehabilitation and adaptation team... The team is led by a physician who is either an oncologist or, more commonly, a physiatrist. An oncology nurse, social worker, psychologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, vocational counselor, chaplain, and nutritionist are present on most teams.

## 19.2.4 Communication and Coordination

### Tumor Boards and Multidisciplinary Conferences

**Function and Impact:**
A tumor conference occasionally alters the primary oncologist's opinions and plans and, thus, the therapeutic approach for a specific patient. A conference may surface unfamiliar data, with references, that can change the course. The most important contribution of a conference, however, is the establishment of dialogue, which impacts on the future disposition of similar clinical problems.

**Benefits of Multidisciplinary Review:**
- **Collective expertise:** Input from multiple specialists
- **Treatment optimization:** Refinement of therapeutic plans
- **Quality assurance:** Peer review of treatment decisions
- **Education:** Learning opportunities for team members

### Care Coordination

**Integrated Treatment Planning:**
Because surgery is increasingly combined with other treatment modalities, it is essential that most patients with solid neoplasms have their treatment planned by a multidisciplinary team, which includes radiation and medical oncologists as well as surgical oncologists.

**Sequential vs. Concurrent Care:**
A second oncologic specialist of a different discipline, whose encounter with the patient occurs after the first oncologist has already changed the tumor and the patient, may rightly point out a better approach for the future. A medical oncologist or radiation oncologist can better know and eventually better treat a patient who has been seen before definitive surgical treatment rather than after.

## 19.2.5 Challenges in Multidisciplinary Care

### Resource and Access Issues

**Workforce Considerations:**
People living with and beyond cancer require multidisciplinary, multispecialty care to address a broad range of health care needs—from monitoring for cancer recurrence to detecting and managing toxicities to addressing psychosocial challenges—that affect their health and well-being throughout their lives.

**Access Barriers:**
However, many people face significant barriers in accessing the specialized medical expertise they need, navigating systems of referrals and payments, and receiving care that is appropriately comprehensive and coordinated.

### Team Dynamics

**Interpersonal Challenges:**
More failures of interdisciplinary management teams seem to occur because of personality conflicts than because of intellectual disagreements. In the heat of confrontational oratory, emotional preferences may win out over reasoned accord.

**Quality Improvement:**
Happily, the energies they squander in picayune or counterproductive activities are small compared to their constructive, positive efforts to seek improved (not just new) approaches to cancer.
