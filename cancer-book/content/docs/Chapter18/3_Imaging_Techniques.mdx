title: 18.2 Imaging Techniques
---




Medical imaging plays a pivotal role in cancer detection, staging, and monitoring, providing essential anatomical and functional information that guides clinical decision-making.

## 18.2.1 Conventional Radiography

**Applications in Cancer Detection:**
- Initial evaluation of suspected pulmonary malignancies
- Bone lesion detection in metastatic workup
- Assessment of bowel obstruction in abdominal malignancies

**Limitations:**
- Limited sensitivity for early-stage cancers
- Inability to provide detailed soft tissue characterization
- Two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional structures

## 18.2.2 Computed Tomography (CT)

**Technical Capabilities:**
CT provides cross-sectional imaging with excellent spatial resolution, enabling detailed evaluation of organ anatomy and pathology.

**Clinical Applications:**
- **Diagnostic imaging:** Choose investigations that give the most information about diagnosis and staging with the least risk to the person.
- **Staging evaluation:** Perform contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, liver adrenals and lower neck before any biopsy procedure.
- **Treatment planning:** Precise localization for radiation therapy planning
- **Response assessment:** Monitoring treatment efficacy through serial imaging

**Advanced CT Techniques:**
- **Multi-detector CT (MDCT):** Rapid acquisition with improved temporal resolution
- **CT angiography:** Vascular assessment without invasive procedures
- **Low-dose CT:** Reduced radiation exposure for screening applications

## 18.2.3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

**Fundamental Principles:**
MRI utilizes magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses to generate detailed images based on tissue characteristics, providing superior soft tissue contrast compared to CT.

**Cancer Applications:**
- **Central nervous system tumors:** Unparalleled soft tissue contrast for brain and spinal cord lesions
- **Musculoskeletal malignancies:** Evaluation of bone and soft tissue tumors
- **Pelvic malignancies:** Assessment of gynecologic and urologic cancers
- **Breast cancer:** Screening in high-risk patients and evaluation of extent of disease

**Functional MRI Techniques:**
- **Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI):** Assessment of cellular density and tissue architecture
- **Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI:** Evaluation of tumor vascularity and perfusion
- **Magnetic resonance spectroscopy:** Metabolic characterization of lesions

## 18.2.4 Positron Emission Tomography (PET)

**Metabolic Imaging Principles:**
PET imaging utilizes radiolabeled tracers to assess metabolic activity, providing functional information that complements anatomical imaging.

**Clinical Applications:**
- **Staging:** Offer PET-CT as the preferred first test after CT with a low probability of nodal malignancy... for people with lung cancer who could potentially have treatment with curative intent.
- **Restaging:** Assessment of treatment response and disease recurrence
- **Radiation therapy planning:** Biological target volume definition
- **Prognostic assessment:** Metabolic parameters correlating with outcomes

**Common Radiotracers:**
- **18F-FDG:** Glucose metabolism assessment in most solid tumors
- **18F-DOPA:** Neuroendocrine tumor evaluation
- **68Ga-PSMA:** Prostate cancer imaging
- **18F-FET:** Brain tumor assessment

## 18.2.5 Ultrasound Imaging

**Technical Advantages:**
- Real-time imaging capability
- Absence of ionizing radiation
- Cost-effectiveness and portability
- Guidance for interventional procedures

**Oncologic Applications:**
- **Breast imaging:** Breast US is widely used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer, to look for additional disease in the breast, for image-guided breast biopsy and localization, assessment of the axilla, and as a second-look tool in patients with abnormalities found on MRI.
- **Abdominal evaluation:** Assessment of liver, kidney, and pelvic malignancies
- **Thyroid nodule evaluation:** Characterization and biopsy guidance
- **Lymph node assessment:** Evaluation of nodal involvement
