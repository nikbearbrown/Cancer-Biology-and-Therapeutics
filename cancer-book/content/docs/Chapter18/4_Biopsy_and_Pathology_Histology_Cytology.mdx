Tissue diagnosis remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, providing definitive pathological confirmation and essential information for treatment planning.

## 18.3.1 Principles of Cancer Pathology

**Fundamental Role:**
Surgical pathologists have the definitive role in tumor diagnosis. No matter how high the index of clinical suspicion, the diagnosis of cancer is not conclusively established nor safely assumed in the absence of a tissue diagnosis. With very few exceptions, definitive therapy for cancer should not be undertaken in the absence of a tissue diagnosis.

**Pathologist Responsibilities:**
Pathologists are physicians who are concerned primarily with the study of disease in all its aspects; that is, causation, diagnosis, pathogenesis, mechanisms, natural history, anatomic and biochemical features, progression, and prognosis.

## 18.3.2 Biopsy Techniques

### Incisional Biopsy

**Indications:**
Incisional biopsy (along with fine-needle aspiration) is often the method of choice for lesions that are inoperable, too large for ready excision, or when excision could lead to functional or cosmetic impairment.

**Technical Considerations:**
- An incisional biopsy is recommended when a malignant diagnosis is suspected, as further surgical intervention is usually required.
- A wedge-shaped biopsy to capture some normal and abnormal tissue may be preferred to facilitate histopathological examination.
- When a more aggressive lesion is suspected, photographs of the lesion in situ and the specimens should be taken.

### Excisional Biopsy

**Advantages:**
Excisional biopsy is often favored because it provides generous amounts of tissue for diagnosis and may itself afford sufficient surgical therapy for some tumors, for example, small- to medium-sized breast cancers.

**Clinical Applications:**
- Complete removal of small, accessible lesions
- Diagnostic and potentially therapeutic procedure
- Optimal tissue preservation for histopathological analysis

### Image-Guided Biopsy

**Technical Approaches:**
- **CT-guided biopsy:** Precise targeting of deep-seated lesions
- **Ultrasound-guided biopsy:** Real-time visualization and guidance
- **MRI-guided biopsy:** Superior soft tissue contrast for targeting
- **Stereotactic biopsy:** Precise localization using coordinate systems

**Specimen Considerations:**
The reliability of biomarker test results depends on the quality of the patient specimens. If the specimen is inadequate for tests that need to be conducted, repeat biopsy procedures may be required to obtain samples sufficient for testing, exposing the patient to unnecessary risk.

## 18.3.3 Cytological Diagnosis

**Advantages of Cytology:**
In both tumor processes and other pathological situations... cytologic examination has the advantage of a microscopic preparation consistent with the tissue of origin, without the changes that occur in histological sections by fixation and processing. In addition, rapid, even intraoperative diagnosis, is possible in the case of neoplasms.

**Cytological Sampling Methods:**
- **Fine needle aspiration (FNA):** Minimally invasive sampling of palpable or image-guided lesions
- **Exfoliative cytology:** Collection of naturally shed cells (e.g., Pap smears)
- **Body fluid analysis:** Examination of pleural, peritoneal, or cerebrospinal fluid
- **Brush cytology:** Sampling of mucosal surfaces through endoscopy

**Limitations:**
Although compared to the histological section, the cytological preparation has some limits regarding the complexity of a tissue, with relationships between cells and/or support tissue, vascularization and a general complex image, cytodiagnosis is, at least for oncology, an extremely useful method.

## 18.3.4 Histopathological Analysis

### Tissue Processing and Staining

**Standard Procedures:**
- **Fixation:** Preservation of tissue architecture and cellular morphology
- **Embedding:** Paraffin processing for sectioning
- **Sectioning:** Creation of thin tissue sections for microscopic examination
- **Staining:** Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and specialized stains

### Immunohistochemistry

**Principles:**
Immunohistochemistry utilizes specific antibodies to identify cellular proteins, providing essential information for cancer classification and treatment planning.

**Clinical Applications:**
- **Cancer subtyping:** Differentiation of morphologically similar tumors
- **Prognostic markers:** Assessment of tumor behavior and patient outcomes
- **Predictive markers:** Selection of targeted therapies
- **Metastatic workup:** Identification of primary tumor site

### Special Stains and Techniques

**Histochemical Stains:**
- **Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS):** Detection of glycogen and mucins
- **Reticulin stains:** Assessment of architectural preservation
- **Trichrome stains:** Evaluation of connective tissue components

**Molecular Pathology Techniques:**
- **In situ hybridization:** Detection of specific nucleic acid sequences
- **Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH):** Chromosomal abnormality assessment
- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR):** Amplification of specific genetic sequences
