title: 18.1 Screening Methods
---




Cancer screening serves as the foundation for early detection, identifying malignancies before clinical symptoms develop. Early diagnosis, during the first stages of cancer development, leads to a precocious therapeutic strategy, with chances of recovery or prolongation of the patient's life expectancy.

## 18.1.1 Principles of Cancer Screening

**Definition and Purpose:**
Screening refers to the systematic examination of asymptomatic individuals to detect early signs of cancer. The fundamental premise underlying cancer screening is that earlier detection enables more effective treatment and improved outcomes.

**Characteristics of Effective Screening Programs:**
- **Population-based approach:** Systematic application to defined populations at risk
- **High sensitivity:** Ability to detect disease when present
- **High specificity:** Minimization of false-positive results
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Benefits must outweigh costs and potential harms
- **Accessibility:** Tests must be feasible for widespread implementation

## 18.1.2 Established Screening Modalities

### Mammographic Screening

Mammography is the mainstay of breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Mammography, together with ultrasound and MRI, is used for the detection and staging of breast cancer and helps guide treatment decisions.

**Technical Advances:**
- **Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT):** DBT is a three-dimensional (3D) imaging method with the potential to overcome the main limitation of standard two-dimensional mammography, a masking effect due to overlapping fibroglandular breast tissue, improving diagnostic accuracy in breast cancer, particularly in dense breasts.
- **Contrast-Enhanced Mammography (CEM):** CEM allows both a morphologic evaluation comparable to routine digital mammography and through contrast agent application a simultaneous assessment of tumor neovascularity as an indicator of malignancy similar to MRI.

**Performance Metrics:**
- The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) was developed by the American College of Radiology in order to standardize terminology describing mammographic findings.
- Acceptable performance metrics include a cancer detection rate of â‰¥2.5 cancers/1000 screens and a recall rate between 5 and 12%
- Randomized controlled trials have found that screening mammography has decreased the mortality for breast cancer by 30%

### Cervical Cancer Screening

Cervical cancer screening represents one of the most successful cancer control programs, demonstrating dramatic reductions in incidence and mortality through systematic implementation.

**Screening Technologies:**
- **Papanicolaou (Pap) cytology:** Traditional method examining cellular morphology
- **Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing:** Detection of high-risk HPV types
- **Co-testing strategies:** Combined cytology and HPV testing for enhanced sensitivity

### Colorectal Cancer Screening

Multiple modalities are available for colorectal cancer screening, each with distinct advantages and limitations.

**Available Methods:**
- **Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT):** Non-invasive detection of microscopic bleeding
- **Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT):** Improved specificity over traditional FOBT
- **Colonoscopy:** Direct visualization with therapeutic capability
- **Flexible sigmoidoscopy:** Limited examination of distal colon
- **CT colonography:** Non-invasive imaging alternative

### Lung Cancer Screening

Recent evidence supports targeted lung cancer screening in high-risk populations using low-dose computed tomography.

**Target Population:**
- Adults aged 50-80 years with significant smoking history
- Current smokers or those who quit within the past 15 years
- Absence of symptoms suggestive of lung cancer

## 18.1.3 Emerging Screening Technologies

### Multi-Cancer Early Detection Tests

The development of multi-cancer early detection technologies represents a paradigm shift in cancer screening, offering the potential to simultaneously screen for multiple cancer types through a single blood test.

**Technological Approach:**
These tests examine genetic signals within blood samples with next-generation sequencing and computational algorithms to assess the presence and type of different cancers.

**Advantages:**
- Simplified sample collection through venipuncture
- Potential detection of cancers lacking established screening programs
- Reduced patient discomfort compared to traditional screening methods
