title: 28.3 Compassionate Use and Expanded Access
---





## 28.3.1 Historical Development

By the end of the 1960s, this concept had been incorporated into the compassionate use IND, which also covered the provision of experimental drugs to patients during FDA review of a new drug application, or NDA (the document submitted by a sponsor after the completion of clinical trials to request permission for marketing).

The expanded access framework evolved through several key developments:
- 1960s: Compassionate use IND established
- 1970s: Open-label safety studies and Group C cancer drug IND
- 1987: Treatment IND regulations finalized

## 28.3.2 Treatment IND Framework

The treatment IND mechanism allows patients suffering from serious or life-threatening conditions for which there is no satisfactory alternative therapy to obtain a promising experimental drug.

**Eligibility Criteria:**
The treatment IND pathway requires:
- Serious or immediately life-threatening disease
- No comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy available
- Drug under investigation in controlled clinical trials
- Evidence of potential effectiveness that would justify the potential risks

**Regulatory Evolution:**
In June 1983, the FDA issued proposed regulations that included a very broad interpretation of the use of investigational drugs for therapeutic purposes: at any time during the investigational process, the FDA could approve a treatment protocol for any patient with a serious disease (the definition of "serious" was left to the discretion of the patient and physician).

## 28.3.3 Contemporary Expanded Access Programs

**Individual Patient Access:**
The most restrictive form of expanded access, reserved for individual patients with serious conditions when:
- No approved treatment alternatives exist
- Patient cannot participate in ongoing clinical trials
- Potential benefits justify potential risks

**Intermediate-Size Patient Population Access:**
For groups of patients (usually fewer than widespread distribution) who:
- Have disease or condition for which there is no approved treatment
- Do not meet eligibility criteria for ongoing clinical trials
- Would benefit from investigational treatment

**Widespread Treatment Access:**
For large numbers of patients when:
- Safety and effectiveness data from Phase III trials support broader access
- Manufacturing capacity allows for expanded distribution
- Mechanism exists to ensure appropriate use

## 28.3.4 Right to Try Legislation

In addition to FDA expanded access programs, "Right to Try" legislation at the state and federal levels has created additional pathways for terminally ill patients to access investigational treatments that have completed Phase I testing.

## 28.3.5 Safety Monitoring and Data Collection

**Ongoing Oversight:**
Serious or life-threatening adverse effects, and all deaths possibly linked to the treatment, must be reported (to the sponsor in the case of non-IND studies and to FDA in the case of those under INDs) expeditiously. All sponsors and FDA have the authority to terminate trials for reasons of patient safety or for poor performance of various types.

**Data Requirements:**
Expanded access programs typically require:
- Informed consent documentation
- Safety reporting
- Limited efficacy data collection
- Regular safety updates to FDA

## 28.3.6 Ethical Considerations

**Balancing Access and Scientific Rigor:**
Expanded access programs must balance compassionate provision of potentially beneficial treatments with the need to maintain scientific integrity of ongoing clinical trials. Key considerations include:

- Ensuring expanded access does not compromise enrollment in controlled trials
- Maintaining appropriate safety oversight
- Collecting meaningful safety and efficacy data
- Protecting vulnerable patient populations

**Informed Consent:**
Patients must understand:
- Investigational nature of the treatment
- Potential risks and benefits
- Alternative treatment options
- Right to withdraw from expanded access treatment

## 28.3.7 Global Perspectives

**European Medicines Agency:**
The Agency seeks knowledge from CSOs to improve the quality of its work and substantiate its scientific opinions, while CSOs offer their experience as patients and expertise as patients' representatives to promote their main interest, namely ensuring better access to safe and innovative medicines and high quality information.

EMA has established similar compassionate use programs, often coordinated with national competent authorities in EU member states.

## 28.3.8 Impact on Drug Development

**Lessons from Expanded Access:**
In the second week of March 1990, headlines across the country described an unusual scientific controversy over the distribution of an investigational drug called dideoxyinosine (ddI) to thousands of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Newspapers reported that patients receiving the drug through a new expanded access program had a much higher death rate than patients enrolled in conventional clinical trials of the drug.

This case highlighted the importance of:
- Careful patient selection for expanded access
- Appropriate safety monitoring
- Recognition that expanded access populations may differ from clinical trial populations
- Need for ongoing safety assessment

## 28.3.9 Future Directions

**Real-World Evidence Integration:**
Expanded access programs increasingly serve as sources of real-world evidence to:
- Supplement clinical trial data
- Inform post-marketing surveillance
- Guide clinical practice recommendations
- Support regulatory decision-making

**Digital Health Integration:**
Technology platforms are being developed to:
- Streamline expanded access applications
- Improve safety monitoring
- Facilitate data collection and analysis
- Enhance patient-physician communication

The landscape of clinical trials and regulatory pathways continues to evolve, driven by scientific advances, patient advocacy, and the need to bring effective treatments to patients as rapidly and safely as possible. Understanding these frameworks is essential for clinicians involved in cancer care, as they directly impact treatment availability and clinical decision-making.
