title: 28.2 FDA/EMA Approval Processes
---





## 28.2.1 FDA Regulatory Framework

**New Drug Application (NDA) Process:**
The manufacturer submits the data from all three clinical trial phases and from the preclinical studies to the FDA in a new drug application (NDA) to market the substance for specific indications. An NDA also contains detailed information on the laboratory formulation and chemistry of the drug, the manufacturing process, quality control procedures, the proposed labeling of the drug, and samples of the drug in its proposed dose and form.

The data from all three phases, but particularly those from Phase III, form the basis for the FDA's decision on approval, including its specification of indications and other parts of the official label.

**Review Timeline:**
The process of review usually takes 10 to 12 months and may include an advisory committee review, but such a review is at the discretion of the FDA.

**Biologics License Application (BLA):**
The approval process for biologics is quite similar to that for drugs, in part because the FDA merged the two Bureaus of Drugs and Biologics from 1982 to 1987 into the Center for Drugs and Biologics. Biologics, however, are regulated under a regime based on the Public Health Service Act of 1944 rather than the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act. Although the evaluation process parallels the drug evaluation process, manufacturers submit a product license application (PLA) rather than an NDA.

## 28.2.2 FDA Expedited Review Programs

The FDA has established several pathways to accelerate the development and review of drugs that address unmet medical needs:

**Fast Track Designation:**
Fast-track review can be requested for IND applications for drugs that fulfill an unmet medical need. Fast-track review allows drug sponsors to meet with the FDA to advance drug development.

**Breakthrough Therapy Designation:**
Breakthrough therapy review can be requested for drugs with clinical data demonstrating significant improvement over existing drugs. Breakthrough drugs also allow drug sponsors to meet with the FDA and sometimes enable sponsors to avoid components of the standard review process.

**Accelerated Approval:**
Accelerated approval is intended for developing drugs with long-term clinical endpoints that may be difficult to measure during clinical trials. Other expedited review programs may also be used alongside accelerated approval.

**Priority Review:**
Priority review can be used for an NDA or BLA to decrease the FDA review period and may be combined with other expedited review programs.

## 28.2.3 FDA Oncology-Specific Initiatives

Review staff within the two divisions of oncology products will specialize in specific oncologic diseases (e.g., breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, melanoma), an approach that Dr. Pazdur noted mirrors what is currently being done in academic comprehensive cancer centers. The motivation for this restructuring was to encourage more consistency of review and improved career building of the FDA staff through increased interaction among FDA staff and outside academic investigators.

In addition, recognizing the growing need to combine unapproved drugs, the agency has created the DHOT, a toxicology-pharmacology division that will focus not just on routine toxicology, but on mechanisms of action. The agency also is hiring people to become thematic leaders, including leaders with expertise in clinical pharmacology or biomarkers.

## 28.2.4 European Medicines Agency (EMA) Framework

**Centralized Procedure:**
The "centralized" procedure works with one single application for a licence, which is then valid for the entire EU; this route is compulsory for some product types, in particular those derived from biotechnology, and for those containing a new active substance licensed after May 2004 and intended to treat the priority conditions of HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases or diabetes.

**EMA Organizational Structure:**
EMA has regulatory policies in place to support and incentivize drug development for rare diseases and conditions, including an orphan designation program, mechanisms for expedited review, and opportunities for sponsors and people with lived rare disease experience to engage with the agency.

**Authority and Recommendations:**
EMA is a decentralized agency of the European Union (EU) that is responsible for evaluating the safety and efficacy of drugs in Europe. However, it does not have the authority to approve medications. Instead, EMA can issue guidance and make authorization recommendations on medical products that the European Commission ultimately approves for marketing in the European Union.

## 28.2.5 EMA Expedited Pathways

There are four expedited authorization pathways for drugs available through EMA. Each program has its own eligibility criteria, process, and benefits. While these pathways are available for any medicine that meets the criteria, they may be particularly relevant for products with orphan designation because orphan products are more likely to meet the criteria of the programs (e.g., meeting an unmet need, intended to treat a life-threatening disease, extremely rare indication).

**Conditional Marketing Authorization:**
Conditional approval from the EMA is a form of conditional marketing authorisation for those medicines that target unmet medical needs for serious conditions with a positive benefitâ€“risk balance, but that do not have sufficient data to support traditional approval.

## 28.2.6 Harmonization and Global Considerations

**International Council for Harmonisation (ICH):**
Both FDA and EMA participate in ICH guidelines, which provide internationally accepted standards for drug development, including Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards that govern clinical trial conduct.

**Approval Rate Comparisons:**
Overall, there was little difference in EMA approval rates for orphan and non-orphan medicine applications (see Figure 3-4) and no discernable differences in approval rates across therapeutic areas.

## 28.2.7 Regulatory Science and Evidence Standards

Dr. Rothenberg suggested that traditional end points for cancer clinical trials, such as overall survival, may not be adequate, especially for assessing the value of newer targeted therapies, and should perhaps be supplanted by other end points that are biologically significant and predictive of outcome but have not served as a basis for regulatory review or approval.

Increased investment in regulatory science studies that assess how best to craft regulations on the basis of the scientific evidence, as recently advocated by the FDA commissioner, might aid with the determination of such data standards.
