## 28.1.1 Historical Context and Evolution

The modern clinical trial system emerged from the recognition that new medical interventions required systematic evaluation before widespread implementation. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) of 1906 was the first federal law to establish the FDA as the main regulatory body for all medications in the United States. This role became more complex with the Durham-Humphrey Amendment of 1951 and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA). These legislative milestones established the foundation for the rigorous testing requirements that characterize contemporary drug development.

In 1961, thalidomide was shown to cause severe congenital disabilities after being marketed in Europe, prompting increased regulations on medication development. The passage of the Kefauver-Harris Amendment in 1962 would allow the FDA to require proof that drugs were both safe and effective before approval. This amendment contained provisions for obtaining informed consent for clinical trials and initiated Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).

## 28.1.2 Preclinical Development

Before any human testing can begin, extensive preclinical research must be conducted. Safety information from preclinical testing is used to support a request to FDA to begin testing the experimental intervention in studies with humans. These studies include laboratory investigations, animal testing, and comprehensive toxicology assessments to provide preliminary evidence that the experimental intervention will be safe and effective for humans.

Before testing with humans begins, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application is filed with the FDA. If the IND application is approved, then clinical trials can begin. The IND must include preclinical data, proposed drug use, safety data from animal studies, and the proposed plan for human studies.

## 28.1.3 Phase I Trials: First-in-Human Studies

Phase I trials are the earliest-stage clinical trials used to study an experimental drug in humans, are typically small (less than 100 participants), and are often used to determine the toxicity and maximum safe dose of a new drug. They provide an initial evaluation of a drug's safety and pharmacokinetics.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
- Characterize pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
- Identify dose-limiting toxicities
- Determine optimal dosing schedule

Phase I trials may involve small numbers (20 to 100) of healthy volunteers, or they may include patients with specific conditions for which targeted pathways have been identified as potentially relevant to the disease under study. A Phase I study may last for several months. In oncology, Some phase I trials, for example, those of studies of treatments for cancer, are performed with individuals with advanced disease who have failed all other standard treatments.

**Design Considerations:**
Phase I trials typically employ dose-escalation designs to systematically identify the appropriate dose for subsequent phases. Common approaches include the traditional 3+3 design, continual reassessment methods, and accelerated titration designs.

## 28.1.4 Phase II Trials: Preliminary Efficacy Assessment

Phase II trials assess the effectiveness of the drug, with continued attention to safety and noncritical side effects, and define the clinical endpoints for the assessment of Phase II and III data. Phase II studies may involve up to several hundred participants who have the disease under study, compared with 20 to 100 healthy individuals in Phase I trials, in which subjects are often randomized.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Assess preliminary efficacy in the target population
- Further characterize safety profile
- Determine optimal dose and schedule for Phase III
- Refine patient selection criteria

Phase II trials are often aimed at gathering preliminary data on whether a drug has clinical efficacy and usually involve 100 to 300 participants. Frequently, phase II trials are used to determine the efficacy and safety of an intervention in participants with the disease for which a new intervention is being developed.

**Design Types:**
- Single-arm studies for rare diseases or when historical controls are appropriate
- Randomized Phase II trials comparing multiple experimental arms
- Selection designs to identify the most promising treatment for Phase III testing

## 28.1.5 Phase III Trials: Definitive Efficacy Studies

Phase III trials are considered the "gold standard" for changing medical practice because the results of these trials are used to obtain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, establish practice guidelines, and make insurance coverage decisions. They are also the most complex and costly trials to conduct.

These trials are both larger (several hundred or even more patients) and longer (one to four years). Often, initiation of Phase III trials occurs after a meeting between the FDA and the drug company sponsoring the trial and the FDA to clarify and agree on the basis for evaluating the drug.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Large sample sizes (hundreds to thousands of participants)
- Randomized, controlled design
- Often multicenter and international
- Primary endpoints typically overall survival or disease-free survival
- Rigorous statistical design with pre-specified analysis plans

Phase III trials are advanced-stage clinical trials designed to show conclusively how well a drug works. Phase III trials are usually larger, frequently multi-institutional studies, and typically involve from a hundred to thousands of participants. They are comparative in nature, with participants usually assigned by chance to at least two arms, one of which serves as a control or a reference arm and one or more of which involve new interventions.

**Pivotal Trials:**
Some phase II and phase III trials are designed as pivotal trials (sometimes also called confirmatory trials), which are adequately controlled trials in which the hypotheses are stated in advance and evaluated. The goal of a pivotal trial is to attempt to eliminate systematic biases and increase the statistical power of a trial. Pivotal trials are intended to provide firm evidence of safety and efficacy.

## 28.1.6 Phase IV Trials: Post-Marketing Surveillance

Phase IV trials are studies conducted after a drug receives regulatory approval from the FDA. They may be used primarily for medical marketing. In some cases, the FDA may require or companies may voluntarily undertake postapproval studies to generate additional information about a drug's long-term safety and efficacy, including its risks, benefits, and optimal use.

Phase IV trials are also used to assess the long-term effects of an intervention and to reveal rare but serious side effects. These studies may take various forms, including:
- Registry studies
- Large simple trials
- Comparative effectiveness research
- Long-term safety surveillance

## 28.1.7 Innovative Trial Designs

**Adaptive Designs:**
Modern oncology increasingly employs adaptive trial designs that allow for modifications based on accumulating data while maintaining scientific integrity. These include:
- Seamless Phase II/III designs
- Biomarker-adaptive trials
- Population enrichment strategies

**Basket and Umbrella Trials:**
Biomarker-based treatments also have the possibility to span across tumour sites and are likely to be assessed using innovative study designs, such as basket and umbrella trials. These designs allow for the efficient evaluation of targeted therapies across multiple cancer types or the simultaneous testing of multiple treatments within a single disease.
