title: 25.4 Cancer Vaccines

Cancer vaccines aim to stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells through active immunization strategies. Two major categories exist: prophylactic vaccines to prevent cancer development and therapeutic vaccines to treat existing cancers.

## 25.4.1 Targets for Cancer Vaccine Therapy

Vaccine targets can be categorized into tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) and tumor-associated antigens (TAAs):

**Tumor-Specific Antigens (TSAs)**:
TSAs comprise gene products uniquely expressed in tumors:

* **Mutated oncogenes**: Point-mutated ras oncogenes (found in 20-30% of human tumors)
* **Mutated tumor suppressors**: p53 mutations (though vast heterogeneity requires individualized approaches)
* **Fusion proteins**: Products of chromosomal translocations (bcr/abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia)
* **Splice variants**: Abnormal RNA processing products
* **Immunoglobulin idiotypes**: Unique surface proteins on B-cell lymphomas

*Advantages of TSAs*:
- Exquisitely tumor-specific
- No expression in normal tissues
- Unlikely to cause autoimmunity

*Challenges with TSAs*:
- Individual patient/tumor specificity may require personalized vaccines
- Variable expression levels may be insufficient for immune targeting
- May be lost during tumor progression

**Tumor-Associated Antigens (TAAs)**:
TAAs are overexpressed in tumors but may also be present in normal tissues:

*Oncofetal Antigens*:
* Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
* MUC-1 (breast cancer mucin)
* Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)
* Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)

*Tissue-Lineage Antigens*:
* Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
* Melanocyte antigens: MART-1/Melan A, tyrosinase, gp100, TRP-1

*Oncogene Products*:
* Non-mutated HER-2/neu
* Overexpressed p53
* Telomerase components

*Viral Antigens*:
* Human papillomavirus (HPV) proteins - cervical cancer
* Hepatitis B virus proteins - hepatocellular carcinoma
* Epstein-Barr virus proteins - certain lymphomas

## 25.4.2 Prophylactic Cancer Vaccines

**HPV Vaccines**:
The most successful cancer vaccine to date targets human papillomavirus:
* **Target**: HPV16 and HPV18 (responsible for ~70% of cervical cancers)
* **Mechanism**: Virus-like particles containing HPV capsid proteins
* **Efficacy**: >90% prevention of HPV-related cervical cancer precursors
* **Clinical impact**: Dramatic reduction in cervical cancer incidence in vaccinated populations

**Hepatitis B Vaccine**:
* **Target**: Hepatitis B surface antigen
* **Cancer prevention**: Hepatocellular carcinoma
* **Mechanism**: Prevents chronic HBV infection, a major risk factor for liver cancer
* **Impact**: Significant reduction in hepatocellular carcinoma incidence in vaccinated populations

## 25.4.3 Therapeutic Cancer Vaccines

Therapeutic vaccines face greater challenges than prophylactic vaccines due to:
* Established tumors with immune escape mechanisms
* Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment
* Tumor heterogeneity and antigen loss variants
* Host immune dysfunction in cancer patients

**Clinical Challenges**:
Recent vaccination-based clinical trials have frequently failed to demonstrate clear relationships between clinical responses and immune responses. Common issues include:
* Weak or undetectable immune responses to vaccines
* Presence of vaccine-specific effector cells without measurable clinical benefit
* Limited correlation between immunological and clinical endpoints

**Vaccine Platforms Under Investigation**:
* Peptide vaccines
* Protein vaccines
* DNA vaccines
* RNA vaccines
* Viral vector vaccines
* Dendritic cell vaccines
* Tumor cell vaccines
