title: 25.1 Fundamentals of Cancer Immunology

The relationship between the immune system and cancer has evolved into one of the most significant therapeutic frontiers in modern oncology. Evidence accumulated over recent decades indicates that the host immune system actively interacts with developing tumors and, in specific circumstances, can arrest tumor growth and induce regression.

## 25.1.1 The Immune System and Tumor Recognition

The fundamental premise of cancer immunotherapy rests on the ability of the immune system to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. In experimental animal models, tumors induced by carcinogens or oncogenic viruses express unique tumor-associated transplantation antigens (TATAs), demonstrating that the immune system can distinguish between normal and transformed cells. When animals are immunized with killed tumor cells, they develop long-lasting, specific antitumor immunity that enables them to reject subsequent challenges with viable tumor cells.

In human cancer patients, the presence of antibodies to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and specific effector cells in peripheral circulation has been extensively documented. This implies that immune cells potentially capable of tumor rejection exist in cancer patients. Various effector mechanisms have been identified:

* **T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity**: Tumor-specific T cells recognize antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
* **Natural killer (NK) cell activity**: Innate immune cells capable of recognizing and eliminating abnormal cells
* **Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)**: Antibody-armed immune cells targeting tumor cells
* **Macrophage-mediated killing**: Activated macrophages capable of tumor cell destruction

## 25.1.2 Immune Surveillance and Escape Mechanisms

Despite the presence of antitumor immune responses, cancers frequently progress, indicating that tumors have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade immune recognition—a phenomenon termed "immunologic escape." Several key mechanisms contribute to immune evasion:

**Antigen Loss or Presentation Defects**
* Loss of tumor-associated antigens through genetic mutations
* Defects in antigen processing machinery
* Downregulation of MHC Class I molecules
* Mutations in β2-microglobulin affecting MHC presentation

**Immunosuppressive Microenvironment**
* Production of immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF-β, IL-10)
* Expression of immune checkpoint molecules
* Recruitment of regulatory immune cells
* Metabolic barriers to T-cell function

**T-cell Dysfunction and Exhaustion**
* Chronic antigen stimulation leading to T-cell exhaustion
* Upregulation of inhibitory receptors
* Loss of effector function and proliferative capacity
