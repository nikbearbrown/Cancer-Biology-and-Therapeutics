title: 25.2 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors

Immune checkpoint inhibitors represent one of the most significant advances in cancer immunotherapy. These molecules normally function as critical control mechanisms to prevent excessive immune activation and autoimmunity, but cancer cells exploit these pathways to evade immune destruction.

## 25.2.1 CTLA-4 Pathway and Inhibition

**Molecular Mechanism of CTLA-4**

Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily with structural homology to the co-stimulatory receptor CD28. CTLA-4 plays a crucial role in immune regulation through several mechanisms:

* **Competitive inhibition**: CTLA-4 binds to B7 ligands (CD80 and CD86) on antigen-presenting cells with higher affinity than CD28, preventing co-stimulatory signaling
* **Ligand capture**: CTLA-4-expressing cells capture and degrade CD80 and CD86 from APC surfaces
* **Cell cycle arrest**: CTLA-4 signaling inhibits IL-2 production and blocks T-cell progression through the cell cycle

CTLA-4 expression is tightly regulated and activation-dependent. Unlike CD28, which is constitutively expressed, CTLA-4 is absent from naive T-cells and only appears following activation, with transcripts detectable within 1 hour and surface expression occurring 24-48 hours post-stimulation. The level of CTLA-4 expression is directly proportional to the strength of T-cell stimulation, establishing a negative feedback mechanism.

**Clinical Development of CTLA-4 Inhibitors**

**Ipilimumab** is a fully human monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 isotype that blocks CTLA-4 from interacting with its ligands. The clinical development of ipilimumab in melanoma has established several important principles:

*Phase III Clinical Results*:
* In previously treated metastatic melanoma: overall survival improved to 10.1 months with ipilimumab versus 6.4 months with control
* First-line therapy combined with dacarbazine: median overall survival of 11.2 months versus 9.1 months with placebo
* Adjuvant therapy in Stage III melanoma: 5-year recurrence-free survival improved to 40.8% versus 30.3% with placebo

*Response Characteristics*:
* Overall response rates: 10.9-15.2% as monotherapy
* Durable responses: plateau in survival curves at 22% at 3 years
* Long-term benefit in responding patients

## 25.2.2 PD-1/PD-L1 Pathway and Inhibition

**Molecular Mechanism of PD-1**

Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) represents a distinct immune checkpoint with different temporal and spatial functions compared to CTLA-4. Key features include:

* **Signal transduction**: Contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and switch motif (ITSM) that recruit phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2
* **TCR signal dampening**: Directly inhibits T-cell receptor signaling rather than competing for co-stimulation
* **Peripheral tolerance**: Functions primarily in peripheral tissues during the effector phase of immune responses
* **Ligand interactions**: Binds to PD-L1 (broadly expressed) and PD-L2 (more restricted expression)

PD-1 expression patterns differ significantly from CTLA-4:
* Absent on resting T-cells, upregulated following activation
* High expression during chronic stimulation (viral infections, cancer)
* Associated with T-cell exhaustion phenotype
* Expression correlates with tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte dysfunction

**PD-L1 Expression and Tumor Immune Escape**

PD-L1 expression serves as an adaptive immune resistance mechanism:
* Constitutively expressed on various immune and non-immune cells
* Upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN-Î³
* Frequently overexpressed on tumor cells
* Located in proximity to CD8+ T-cell infiltrates
* Creates a localized immunosuppressive environment

**Clinical Development of PD-1 Inhibitors**

**Nivolumab** and **Pembrolizumab** are fully human monoclonal antibodies of the IgG4 isotype targeting PD-1:

*Clinical Efficacy*:
* Previously treated melanoma: 31.7% objective response rate with nivolumab versus 10.7% with chemotherapy
* First-line wild-type BRAF melanoma: 1-year overall survival 72.9% versus 42.1% with dacarbazine
* Pembrolizumab first-line: 1-year overall survival 74.1% versus 58.2% with ipilimumab

*Safety Profile*:
* Lower incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse events compared to CTLA-4 inhibitors
* Common adverse events: fatigue, rash, diarrhea, pruritus, nausea
* Improved tolerability allows for longer treatment durations

## 25.2.3 Combination Immune Checkpoint Inhibition

The distinct mechanisms and timing of CTLA-4 and PD-1 provide rationale for combination therapy:

**Mechanistic Rationale**:
* CTLA-4 affects T-cell priming phase
* PD-1 impacts effector phase in peripheral tissues
* Non-overlapping pathways may provide synergistic benefit

**Clinical Results**:
* Combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab: 57.6% objective response rate
* Median progression-free survival: 11.5 months versus 6.9 months (nivolumab alone) or 2.9 months (ipilimumab alone)
* Enhanced efficacy comes with increased toxicity: 55.5% Grade 3-4 adverse events
