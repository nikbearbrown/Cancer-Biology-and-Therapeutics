## 25.3.1 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell Therapy

**CAR Design and Function**

Chimeric antigen receptors are recombinant receptors that redirect T-lymphocyte specificity and function in a single engineered molecule. The concept leverages several advantages:

* **Rapid deployment**: Bypasses barriers and kinetics of active immunization
* **Homogeneous targeting**: Programmed to target specific tumor-associated antigens
* **Enhanced potency**: Supraphysiologic activities compared to natural T-cells
* **Persistence**: Designed to maintain long-term surveillance

**CAR Structure and Components**:
* **Extracellular domain**: Recognizes specific tumor antigen (often derived from monoclonal antibodies)
* **Transmembrane domain**: Anchors the receptor in the cell membrane
* **Intracellular signaling domains**: 
  - CD3 zeta: Critical for T-cell activation and anti-tumor activity
  - Co-stimulatory domains (4-1BB/CD137): Enhance expansion and persistence

**FDA-Approved CAR T-cell Products**

**Tisagenlecleucel**: CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy
* Target: B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
* Design: Murine single-chain antibody fragment fused to 4-1BB and CD3 zeta domains
* Mechanism: Binds CD19-expressing cells, transmits activation signal, promotes T-cell expansion and target elimination

**Axicabtagene ciloleucel**: CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy
* Similar mechanism targeting CD19-expressing malignancies
* Different co-stimulatory domain configuration

## 25.3.2 CAR T-cell Therapy Process

**Manufacturing Process**:
1. **Leukapheresis**: Collection of patient's peripheral blood T-cells
2. **Genetic modification**: Introduction of CAR transgene using viral vectors
3. **Ex vivo expansion**: Proliferation of CAR-expressing T-cells in laboratory
4. **Quality control**: Testing for identity, purity, potency, and safety
5. **Cryopreservation**: Freezing and storage until patient ready for infusion
6. **Reinfusion**: Administration of CAR T-cells to patient

**Clinical Considerations**:
* **Patient preparation**: Lymphodepleting chemotherapy to enhance CAR T-cell engraftment
* **Monitoring**: Close observation for cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity
* **Supportive care**: Management of complications and side effects

## 25.3.3 Expanding CAR T-cell Targets

Beyond CD19-targeting in B-cell malignancies, numerous tumor-associated antigens are under investigation for CAR T-cell therapy:

**Hematologic Malignancies**:
* BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) - multiple myeloma
* CD22 - B-cell malignancies
* CD30 - Hodgkin lymphoma

**Solid Tumors** (representing greater challenges):
* EGFR - lung cancer, epithelial carcinomas, glioma
* EGFRvIII - glioblastoma
* HER2 - breast, ovarian, brain tumors
* Mesothelin - mesothelioma, ovarian, pancreatic cancer
* PSMA - prostate cancer
* CEA - colorectal, pancreatic, breast cancer

## 25.3.4 Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) Therapy

Adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes represents another form of cellular immunotherapy:

**Clinical Experience**:
* 36% objective cancer remission in metastatic melanoma patients
* Expansion of lymphocytes from tumor tissue
* Ex vivo activation and proliferation
* Reinfusion with supportive cytokines

**Advantages**:
* Uses naturally occurring tumor-specific T-cells
* Polyclonal response against multiple antigens
* Proven clinical efficacy in melanoma
