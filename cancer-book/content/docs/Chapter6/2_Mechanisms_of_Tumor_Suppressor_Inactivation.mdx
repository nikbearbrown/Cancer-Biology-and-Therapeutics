title: 6.2 Mechanisms of Tumor Suppressor Inactivation

## 6.2.1 Genetic Mechanisms of Inactivation

Loss of function of tumor-suppressor genes usually occurs in a bimodal fashion, and most frequently involves point mutations in one allele and loss of the second allele by a deletion, recombinational event, or chromosomal nondisjunction.

**Point Mutations and Structural Alterations**

Tumor suppressor genes can be inactivated through various mechanisms:

- **Point mutations**: Including nonsense, missense, and frameshift mutations
- **Deletions**: Large-scale chromosomal deletions or focal gene deletions
- **Chromosomal rearrangements**: Translocations, inversions, and other structural variants

## 6.2.2 Epigenetic Mechanisms of Inactivation

Beyond genetic alterations, tumor suppressor genes can be silenced through epigenetic mechanisms that do not alter the DNA sequence itself but affect gene expression.

**DNA Methylation**

The CIMP pathway is implicated in roughly 15% of colon cancers and is characterized by CpG island hypermethylation. CIMP-related tumors tend to arise in serrated polyps rather than classical adenomas and are often associated with KRAS and BRAF mutations. This demonstrates how promoter hypermethylation can silence tumor suppressor genes.

## 6.2.3 The Two-Hit Model in Practice

Whereas germ line APC mutations are an uncommon cause of colorectal cancer in the general population and are present in only about 0.5% of all colon cancers, somatic APC mutations are present in the vast majority of sporadic colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. This illustrates how both inherited and somatic mutations can inactivate the same tumor suppressor gene.
