title: Conclusion

---

A current view is that cancers arise through a multistage process in which inherited and somatic mutations of cellular genes lead to clonal selection of variant progeny with the most robust and aggressive growth properties. Two classes of genes, protooncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, are targets for the mutations.

The study of tumor suppressor genes has revolutionized our understanding of cancer biology and continues to provide insights into cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. These mutations occur in genes that control cell growth and cell death. The activation of protooncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes are mutational events that drive the multistep process of carcinogenesis.
