## 6.5.1 Emerging Tumor Suppressors

Enormous progress has been made in the identification of inherited and somatic mutations in tumor-suppressor genes in human cancer, as well as in defining the means by which loss-of-function mutations in these genes contribute to the development of cancer.

## 6.5.2 Therapeutic Development

The recent sequencing of the human genome and the availability of increasingly powerful tools for systematically searching DNA for significant mutations should soon lead to a much more complete catalog of cancer-critical genes.
