title: 6.4 Clinical Implications of Tumor Suppressors

## 6.4.1 Hereditary Cancer Syndromes

There are even familial cancer syndromes associated with the loss of function germline mutations of specific tumor suppressor genes like Li-Fraumeni syndrome with the loss of TP53.

## 6.4.2 Therapeutic Targeting

The understanding of tumor suppressor gene function has led to novel therapeutic approaches:

**Synthetic Lethality**

The concept of synthetic lethality has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, particularly exemplified by the use of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-deficient cancers.

**DNA Repair Targeting**

Scientists used to think that radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs killed cancer cells directly by harming their DNA. It seems clear now that such therapy only slightly damages the DNA in cells; the damaged cells, in response, actively kill themselves. This understanding has led to strategies that exploit defective DNA repair in tumor suppressor-deficient cancers.

## 6.4.3 Diagnostic Applications

In addition to the controls on proliferation afforded by the coordinated action of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, cells also have at least three other systems that can help them avoid runaway cell division. The first of these systems is the DNA repair system. This system operates in virtually every cell in the body, detecting and correcting errors in DNA.
