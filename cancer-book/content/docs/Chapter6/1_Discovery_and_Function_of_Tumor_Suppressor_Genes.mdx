title: 6.1 Discovery and Function of Tumor Suppressor Genes

## 6.1.1 Historical Perspective and Discovery

The concept of tumor suppressor genes emerged from converging lines of evidence that challenged the prevailing oncogene-centric view of cancer development. The first insight into the activity of tumor suppressor genes came from somatic cell hybridization experiments, initiated by Henry Harris and his colleagues in 1969. The fusion of normal cells with tumor cells yielded hybrid cells containing chromosomes from both parents. In most cases, such hybrid cells were not capable of forming tumors in animals. Therefore, it appeared that genes derived from the normal cell parent acted to inhibit (or suppress) tumor development.

**Cell Fusion Studies**

The fusion of normal cells with tumor cells yielded hybrid cells containing chromosomes from both parents. In most cases, such hybrid cells were not capable of forming tumors in animals. Therefore, it appeared that genes derived from the normal cell parent acted to inhibit (or suppress) tumor development. These experiments provided the first functional evidence for the existence of genes that could suppress malignancy.

**The Two-Hit Hypothesis**

The molecular basis for tumor suppressor gene function was established through studies of retinoblastoma, a rare childhood eye tumor. Interestingly, about 60% of retinoblastomas occur sporadically (almost always in one eye), and these patients are not at increased risk for other forms of cancer. To explain this dichotomy, Knudson proposed a "two-hit" hypothesis: In the inherited form of retinoblastoma, children inherit one mutated RB allele (germ-line mutation), and the other copy is normal. Retinoblastoma develops when the normal retinoblastoma (RB) allele undergoes a spontaneous somatic mutation; this is the "second hit." In sporadic cases of retinoblastoma, both normal RB alleles must undergo a somatic mutation in the same cell. The probability of this is low, which explains why retinoblastoma is uncommon in the general population.

**Molecular Identification of Tumor Suppressors**

The first tumor suppressor gene was identified by studies of retinoblastoma, a rare childhood eye tumor. Visible deletions of chromosome 13q14 were found in some retinoblastomas, suggesting that loss (rather than activation) of the Rb gene led to tumor development. Gene-mapping studies further indicated that tumor development resulted from loss of normal Rb alleles in the tumor cells, consistent with the function of Rb as a tumor suppressor gene. Isolation of the Rb gene as a molecular clone in 1986 then firmly established that Rb is consistently lost or mutated in retinoblastomas. Gene transfer experiments also demonstrated that introduction of a normal Rb gene into retinoblastoma cells reverses their tumorigenicity, providing direct evidence for the activity of Rb as a tumor suppressor.

Following the identification of RB1, the second tumor suppressor gene to have been identified is p53, which is frequently inactivated in a wide variety of human cancers, including leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas and many other cancer types.

## 6.1.2 General Functions of Tumor Suppressor Genes

Tumor suppressor genes are important genes that act within the genome to regulate several cellular functions. These genes can be broadly classified based on their role in cell growth/cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, DNA repair mechanisms, and other crucial cellular signaling functions such as the apoptosis induction. Without functional tumor suppressor genes, there is a high risk of dysregulated cell growth that is a well-known mechanism for the development of cancers.

**Cell Cycle Regulation**

Two categories of genes play major roles in triggering cancer. In their normal forms, these genes control the cell cycle, the sequence of events by which cells enlarge and divide. One category of genes, called proto-oncogenes, encourages cell division. The other category, called tumor suppressor genes, inhibits it. Together, proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes coordinate the regulated growth that normally ensures that each tissue and organ in the body maintains a size and structure that meets the body's needs.

**DNA Damage Response and Repair**

DNA repair pathway gene defects recently have been implicated in a fairly broad spectrum of human cancers. Like other tumor-suppressor genes, the DNA repair genes are inactivated in human cancers. However, because of their cellular function, it might be argued that they constitute a unique subset of the tumor-suppressor genes.

**Apoptosis Regulation**

A second cellular back-up system prompts a cell to commit suicide (undergo apoptosis) if some essential component is damaged or its control system is deregulated. This observation suggests that tumors arise from cells that have managed to evade such death. One way of avoiding apoptosis involves the p53 protein. In its normal form, this protein not only halts cell division, but induces apoptosis in abnormal cells. The product of a tumor suppressor gene, p53 is inactivated in many types of cancers.

## 6.1.3 Classification and Properties

Based on these original observations, there are three important properties of classic tumor suppressor genes (TSGs): Classic tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are recessive at the cellular level, meaning that both copies must typically be inactivated for cancer to develop.

Cancer-critical genes in general can be classified into two groups, according to whether the dangerous mutations in them are those that cause loss of function or those that cause gain of function. Loss-of-function mutations of tumor suppressor genes relieve cells of inhibitions that normally help to hold their numbers in check; gain-of-function mutations of proto-oncogenes stimulate cells to increase their numbers when they should not.

In the case of the tumor suppressor gene, on the other hand, the cancer-causing mutations are generally recessive: both copies of the normal gene must be removed or inactivated in the diploid somatic cell before an effect is seen. This calls for a different approach, to discover what is missing.
