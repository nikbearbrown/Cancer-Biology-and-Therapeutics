## 6.3.1 TP53: Guardian of the Genome

The p53 gene like the Rb gene, is a tumor suppressor gene, i.e., its activity stops the formation of tumors. If a person inherits only one functional copy of the p53 gene from their parents, they are predisposed to cancer and usually develop several independent tumors in a variety of tissues in early adulthood. This condition is rare, and is known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. However, mutations in p53 are found in most tumor types, and so contribute to the complex network of molecular events leading to tumor formation.

**Structure and Function**

The p53 gene has been mapped to chromosome 17. In the cell, p53 protein binds DNA, which in turn stimulates another gene to produce a protein called p21 that interacts with a cell division-stimulating protein (cdk2). When p21 is complexed with cdk2 the cell cannot pass through to the next stage of cell division. Mutant p53 can no longer bind DNA in an effective way, and as a consequence the p21 protein is not made available to act as the 'stop signal' for cell division.

**Role in DNA Damage Response**

The p53 tumor-suppressor gene is central in the response pathway to cellular stress. For example, DNA damage caused by chemical carcinogens activates the p53 tumor-suppressor protein by posttranslational modification to transduce signals to "guard the genome" by engaging cell-cycle checkpoints and enhancing DNA repair, and as a fail-safe mechanism, to cause replicative senescence or apoptotic death. Mutations in the p53 gene or inactivation of its encoded protein by viral oncoproteins generally lead to a loss of these cellular defense functions.

**Clinical Significance**

Most of the cancers demonstrate a biallelic loss-of-function mutation in TP53. Uncommon patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have a very high incidence of a wide variety of cancers like breast cancer, soft-tissue, and bone sarcomas, and brain tumors since they inherit one defective copy of TP53.

## 6.3.2 RB1: Master Regulator of the Cell Cycle

The retinoblastoma gene (RB1) was the first tumor suppressor gene to be identified and serves as the prototypical example of Knudson's two-hit hypothesis.

**Normal Function**

Although Rb was identified in a rare childhood cancer, it is also involved in some of the more common tumors of adults. In particular, studies of the cloned gene have established that Rb is lost or inactivated in many bladder, breast, and lung carcinomas. The significance of the Rb tumor suppressor gene thus extends beyond retinoblastoma, apparently contributing to development of a substantial fraction of more common human cancers.

**Viral Inactivation**

In addition, as noted earlier in this chapter, the Rb protein is a key target for the oncogene proteins of several DNA tumor viruses, including SV40, adenoviruses, and human papillomaviruses, which bind to Rb and inhibit its activity. Transformation by these viruses thus results, at least in part, from inactivation of Rb at the protein level rather than from mutational inactivation of the Rb gene.

## 6.3.3 BRCA1 and BRCA2: Guardians of Genomic Integrity

BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) is characterized by an increased risk for female and male breast cancer, ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers), and to a lesser extent other cancers such as prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma primarily in individuals with a BRCA2 pathogenic variant.

**Molecular Functions**

The BRCA1/BARD1 protein complex enhances ubiquitin ligase activity, which is associated with the regulation of centrosome function and involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. BRCA1 colocalizes with BRCA2 and RAD51 at sites of DNA damage and activates RAD51-mediated homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks. BRCA2 regulates the availability and activity of RAD51, which coats single-strand DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament that invades and pairs with a homologous DNA duplex.

**DNA Repair Functions**

Subsequent transducers and effectors include the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1 complex (both transducer and effector), and the breast cancer susceptibility proteins BRCA1 (a transducer) and BRCA2 (an effector). BRCA2 interacts directly with DNA and the Rad51 strand-transferase to help initiate homologous recombination.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are essential for efficient HRR (homologous recombinational repair), but the precise biochemical role for BRCA1 remains unclear.

**Clinical Implications**

Several lines of investigation have implicated BRCA1 and BRCA2 in DNA damage-response pathways. An association between BRCA1 and p53 and the subsequent enhancement of p53 activity incriminates BRCA1 in p21-mediated cell-cycle arrest following DNA damage. In addition, BRCA1 forms complexes with both BRCA2 and Rad51, the human homolog of the Escherichia coli gene RecA, which is essential to normal recombination and genome stability.

**Therapeutic Targeting**

PARP inhibitors have emerged as a promising treatment in individuals with BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast cancer, given their role in DNA repair. Because BRCA1, BRCA2, and PARP participate in DNA repair, their mutual disruption could lead to "synergistic lethality" of tumor cells.

## 6.3.4 APC: The Colorectal Cancer Gatekeeper

The APC gene is large, with more than 15 exons, and alternative splicing affects the 5′ untranslated portion of transcripts. The predominant APC transcript encodes a 2,843-amino-acid protein expressed in many adult tissues.

**Role in Colorectal Cancer**

Among the earliest and most common events in the colorectal tumor progression pathway is loss or pathogenic variant–inactivation of the APC gene. APC mutations have been reported in up to 80% of adenomas and in up to 80% of carcinomas. Functionally, the APC gene is involved in the wingless/Wnt signaling pathway.

**Familial Adenomatous Polyposis**

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant polyposis syndrome characterized by varying degrees of penetrance. The primary genetic defect associated with this disorder is a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene.

If left untreated, affected individuals develop hundreds to thousands of polyps throughout the colon and rectum, often manifesting in the early teenage years. This condition ultimately results in an almost 100% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer, typically occurring by age 40.

**Molecular Function**

The APC gene on chromosome 5q21 encodes a 2,843-amino acid protein that is important in cell adhesion and signal transduction; the main function of the APC protein is to regulate intracellular concentrations of beta-catenin, a major mediator of the Wnt signal transduction pathway.

The APC protein is now known to be an inhibitory component of the Wnt signaling pathway. It acts by binding to β-catenin, another component of the pathway, and thereby preventing activation of TCF4, a gene regulatory protein that stimulates growth of the colonic epithelium when it has β-catenin bound to it.

## 6.3.5 PTEN: A Phosphatase with Broad Tumor Suppressive Functions

The PTEN gene, located on chromosome 10q23, is missing or mutated in a variety of human cancers, including glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer), endometrial (uterine) tumors, and prostate cancer, as well as in Cowden disease cells.

**Molecular Function**

The PTEN tumor suppressor gene acts as a phospholipid phosphatase. Under normal growth conditions, stimulatory signals from the insulin receptor activate the enzyme phosphoinositide kinase (PI3-kinase), which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol to generate PIP3, a key second messenger.

PTEN belongs to a subclass of phosphatases called dual-specificity phosphatases that remove phosphate groups from tyrosine as well as serine and threonine. In addition, PTEN is the major phosphatase for phosphoinositide-3,4,5-triphosphate, and thus downregulates the PI3K/AKT pathway.

If PTEN fails to deactivate PIP3 because of a mutation in its phosphatase domain, downstream signals are not switched off, and therefore PKB/Akt remains in the "on" state. In this case, PKB/Akt can continue to stimulate downstream proteins such as transcription factors and glucose transporters, which could lead to enhanced cell growth.

**PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome**

The PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) includes Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN-related Proteus syndrome (PS), and PTEN-related Proteus-like syndrome. CS is a multiple hamartoma syndrome with a high risk for benign and malignant tumors of the thyroid, breast, kidney, and endometrium.

Autosomally dominant inherited mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN are responsible for Cowden disease. The protein encoded by the PTEN gene contributes to the control of apoptosis and the cell cycle. Specifically, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is down-regulated by the PTEN gene product, resulting in decreased cellular proliferation and survival.
