title: 13.7 Angiogenesis and Metastasis
---


Tumor metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related deaths. Tumor metastasis is orchestrated by a complex network of biological events. One such event is the formation of new blood vessels, termed as tumor angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis is essential for tumor progression. Without tumor angiogenesis, most solid tumors remain dormant.

## 13.7.1 Angiogenesis in the Metastatic Process

Apart from supplying tumors with nutrients and oxygen, tumor blood vessels provide a route for metastasis. Endothelial cells are key players in the formation of neovessels. Tumor endothelial cells that line tumor blood vessels differ from normal endothelial cells in many aspects.

The tumor must also initialize angiogenesis, without which the tumor would fail to develop, as local diffusion for transport of nutrients to and removal of waste products from the tumor site would suffice for tumors up to 2 mm in diameter. The blood vessel within the tumor's vicinity can then provide a route for the detached cells to enter the circulatory system and metastasize to distant sites; the process of intravasation.

Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that the process of metastasis is also angiogenesis dependent. For a tumor cell to metastasize successfully, it must breach several barriers and be able to respond to specific growth factors. Thus, tumor cells must gain access to the vasculature in the primary tumor, survive the circulation, arrest in the microvasculature of the target organ, exit from this vasculature, grow in the target organ, and induce angiogenesis.

## 13.7.2 Vascular Properties in Metastasis

Tumor endothelial cells are irregular monolayers, have a higher expression of proangiogenic factors, and impaired endothelial barrier function when compared with their normal counterparts. The basement membrane thickness of tumor blood vessels is uneven and the association between pericytes and tumor endothelial cells is weak, leading to vascular leakiness.

VEGF is highly expressed in tumor endothelial cells (TECs), and because VEGF is a known factor to enhance permeability of blood vessels, tumor blood vessels typically are leaky and immature structures. Tumor cells can enter the circulation by penetrating through proliferating capillaries that have fragmented basement membranes and are leaky.

Angiogenic factors from tumors such as bFGF and VPF/VEGF induce increased production of plasminogen activator and collagenases in proliferating endothelial cells, thus further contributing to degradation of basement membranes. These degradative enzymes may facilitate the entry of tumor cells into the circulation.

## 13.7.3 Metastatic Angiogenesis

Tumor cells that have successfully metastasized may not immediately become neovascularized after reaching the target organ. Such a metastasis lacking angiogenic activity for any of a variety of reasons may remain as a microscopic tumor of 100 to 200 μm diameter indefinitely. It is generally assumed that in human dormant micrometastases (e.g., metastases appearing 5–10 years after removal of a breast cancer), tumor cells are not cycling or are in G0.

One of the important components in a cell's journey to a distant metastatic site is its angiogenic potential. A primary tumor cell must have access to the bloodstream and inhabit an area with blood vessels that can be extended using growth factors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). After the cell extravasates, the metastasizing cell can grow along the blood-vessels for perivascular growth or can recruit new blood vessels for angiogenesis.
