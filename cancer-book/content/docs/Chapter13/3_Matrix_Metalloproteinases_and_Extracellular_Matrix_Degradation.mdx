title: 13.3 Matrix Metalloproteinases and Extracellular Matrix Degradation
---


Controlled remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for growth, invasion, and metastasis of malignant tumors. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of secreted, zinc-dependent endopeptidases collectively capable of degrading ECM components, and there is a considerable amount of evidence that they play an important role at different steps of malignant tumor growth.

## 13.3.1 Matrix Metalloproteinase Structure and Function

MMPs are a family of structurally related, zinc-dependent endopeptidases collectively capable of degrading essentially all components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). There is strong evidence for the role of MMPs in physiological ECM remodeling, e.g., during tissue morphogenesis, growth, uterine cycling and postpartum involution, tissue repair, and angiogenesis.

The MMP family currently comprises 23 human homologs. MMP protein structure is made of specific domains some of which are common to all MMPs. These conserved domains include a "pre" domain which directs the MMPs to the endoplasmic reticulum, a "pro" domain which maintains the MMP in an inactive form and a "catalytic" domain. Most MMPs also contain a c-terminal hemopexin-like domain, which mediates interactions with substrates and in some cases, directs substrate specificity and participates in substrate binding.

Collectively, MMPs can degrade virtually every component of the ECM. Initially, MMPs were thought to predominantly degrade specific components of the ECM thereby providing new substrates facilitating migration and invasion. Since then, it has become clear that by degrading ECM components, MMPs can also modulate signaling pathways from the ECM and modulate the bioavailability of growth factors.

## 13.3.2 MMPs in Cancer Invasion

The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are an important component of cell invasion capability. Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) plays an important role in the breakdown of extracellular matrix and mediates pathways of apoptosis, angiogenesis, and immunity. It has been demonstrated that MMP-1 overexpression is associated with tumor initiation, invasion, and metastasis.

In oral squamous cell carcinoma Snail and Slug are seen to act as regulators of TGFβ triggered EMT, with Snail upregulating MMP2 and MMP9 initiating EMT; while Slug and Snail maintain longer term EMT by stimulating MMP9 expression. The MMPs not only function in membrane/ matrix degradation but are also involved in cell adhesion.

Treatment of MCF-7 cells with MMP7 results in E-cadherin cleavage producing an 80kDa fraction which is detectable in the serum and urine of cancer patients and has been proposed as a biomarker. Similarly, MMP9 appears to cleave the TJ molecule Occludin.

Particular attention has been paid to the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 (gelatinase A and B, respectively), previously denoted type-IV collagenases (72 kDa and 92 kDa type IV collagenases, respectively), since they specifically can degrade type IV collagen, the major component of basement membranes.

## 13.3.3 MMP Regulation and Inhibition

At present, several synthetic MMP inhibitors are in clinical trials evaluating their ability to inhibit growth and invasion of malignant tumors in vivo. Gene delivery of TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4 into malignant cells may also be a potent way of inhibiting tumor growth and invasion. Furthermore, an effective way of inhibiting MMP expression may be blocking signaling pathways mediating activation of MMP gene expression.

Recent observations also suggest that MMPs play a role in cancer cell survival. Furthermore, others substrates have now been identified, the cleavage of which is also involved in increased migratory and invasive properties. Thus, cell adhesion molecules (E-cadherin, CD44, αv integrin) or growth factor receptors (FGF receptor 1, members of the EGF receptor family HER2 and HER4, c-met) can be processed by MMP-dependent proteolysis.
