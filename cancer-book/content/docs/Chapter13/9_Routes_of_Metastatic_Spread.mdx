title: 13.9 Routes of Metastatic Spread
---


The general patterns of metastatic spread observed clinically include the following routes: hematogenous, lymphatic, transcoelomic, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is important first to define what metastatic disease is not: it is not simply a primary cancer that is large in size or locally invasive.

## 13.9.1 Lymphatic Spread

Lymphatic spread occurs in 2 ways: antegrade invasion through the diaphragm or pleural surfaces or retrograde spread from hilar nodal metastases. Examples include lung, stomach, breast, pancreas, uterus, rectum, and prostate cancer.

## 13.9.2 Hematogenous Spread

Hematogenous spread: seen in tumors with venous drainage into lungs, eg, head and neck, thyroid, adrenals, kidneys, testes, melanoma, and osteosarcoma. Among the routes mentioned above, hematogenous spread through Batson's plexus system is the most common pathway for tumor embolization and spinal invasion.

## 13.9.3 Transcoelomic Spread

Direct spread to pleura: occurs due to hematogenous dissemination with extension to the pleura, with lymphatic spread, or from established hepatic metastases. Examples include cancers of the lung, breast, pancreas, and stomach. A Krukenberg tumor is a metastasis to the ovary (or ovaries) of gastric adenocarcinoma or another gastrointestinal cancer primary. The route of spread is transcoelomic, involving mechanical sloughing of malignant cells from the primary gastric cancer, followed by migration and circulation through the peritoneal cavity, adhesion, then invasion and proliferation on foreign tissue.
