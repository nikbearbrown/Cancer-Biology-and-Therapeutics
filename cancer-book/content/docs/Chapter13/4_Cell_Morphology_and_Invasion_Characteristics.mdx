title: 13.4 Cell Morphology and Invasion Characteristics

The malignant cell is characterized by: acceleration of the cell cycle; genomic alterations; invasive growth; increased cell mobility; chemotaxis; changes in the cellular surface; secretion of lytic factors, etc.

## 13.4.1 Cellular Features of Invasive Cancer Cells

Microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules appear in different proportions, in malignant cells. The capacity of invasion and metastasizing of the cancerous cell depends on its possibility to move, which is ensured by the actin content. Epithelial carcinomas contain cytokeratins, mesenchymal tumors contain vimentin, and in the central nervous system cells is an acid protein from glial fibers, with a special role in tumor diagnosis.

Cytostatics act by the depolymerization of tumor cell microtubules, which leads to the inhibition of the metastasizing capacity, as well as mitosis and tumor growth. The cell membrane plays an extremely important role in the malignization process. Surface molecular changes, associated with malignization, are able to influence the evolution of a tumor, as well as the host reactions to the lesion.

The presence of desmosomes and tight junctions facilitates the establishment of the epithelial origin of the neoplasm, while their absence indicates the mesenchymal origin. The basal membrane is present in benign tumors, while the invasive growth of malignant cells is characterized by fragmentation, reduplication or disappearance of the basal membrane.

## 13.4.2 Basement Membrane Changes

During the first phases of malignancy, defects are produced with the interruption of the lamina densa. Malignant cells have lytic factors that destroy the basal membrane. The loss of the basal membrane is considered a fundamental criterion of morphological and biological differentiation between benign and malignant tumors. The basal membrane in malignant cells changes its structure or/and ratios between various components, such as: type IV collagen, laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycan and fibronectin.

## 13.4.3 Heterogeneity of Metastatic Potential

Metastases are selectively derived from a genotypically distinct cell population compared to the primary tumor. On average, metastatic cells are much more metastasizing than their non-metastatic equivalents from the primary tumor. So, not all the cells of a primary tumor can metastasize, which is a selective property that only a minority of mutant cells or cell variants possess.

The same authors prove the existence of a correlation between the phenotypic characteristics and the presence of certain genes in the malformed cell with metastatic properties, such as the detachment and mobilization from the primary tumor, the invasion in and from blood or lymphatic vessels, survival in the circulatory system, growth in an ectopic microenvironment, angiogenesis, etc. The metastatic process is selective, and metastatic potential proves to intensify based on a successive selection of neoplastic cells.
