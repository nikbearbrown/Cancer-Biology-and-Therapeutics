title: 13.2 Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)
---


Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a type of epithelial plasticity that is characterized by long-lasting morphological and molecular changes in epithelial cells as a result of transdifferentiation towards a mesenchymal cell type.

## 13.2.1 Definition and Characteristics of EMT

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a morphogenetic event during which cells lose their epithelial characteristics, such as apicobasal polarity, and gain mesenchymal features with an increased migratory and invasive potential. As cells undergo EMT, they lose their epithelial features including loss of their sheet-like architecture, loss of polarity, and down regulation of E-cadherin. The cells also develop a mesenchymal phenotype, taking on a spindle-like, fusiform morphology, become motile, and start expressing mesenchymal markers, e.g. N-cadherin, fibronectin, vimentin.

EMT encompasses all changes in cell morphology from epithelioid to mesenchymal/fibroblastoid/spindle-shaped. A functional transition of fully differentiated polarized epithelial cells to mobile mesenchymal cells occurs. Like metaplasia, EMT occurs in physiological and pathological circumstances, including embryonic gastrulation, tissue regeneration, inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer metastasis.

## 13.2.2 EMT in Embryonic Development

Initially, EMT was observed in embryological and adult development with many well characterized examples including the conversions of epiblast to primary mesenchyme (gastrulation), somite to sclerotome, somite to dermis, myotome to migratory myoblast, dorsal neural tube to neural crest, placodal ectoderm to cranial ganglion precursor, intermediate mesoderm to nephric mesenchyme, lateral mesoderm to connective/muscular tissue, endocardium to cardiac cushion mesenchyme and trophectoderm invasion.

The progenitors of the mitral and tricuspid valves and the membranous interventricular septum in the heart arise by an epithelial-mesenchymal cell transformation (EMT) from embryonic endothelial cells. Experiments using collagen gel cultures to mimic the three dimensional environment in the embryonic heart cushions showed that EMT was triggered by an inductive stimulus produced by the adjacent myocardium.

## 13.2.3 TGF-β and EMT Regulation

The transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is involved in a whole range of biological functions, from cell growth to cell differentiation and apoptosis. The role of TGFβ in epithelial-mesenchymal-transitions (EMTs) has been shown for both embryonic development and tumorigenesis. All three TGFβ mammalian isoforms - TGFβ1, TGFβ2 and TGFβ3 — can regulate EMTs, with distinct outcomes depending on the tissue and on the state of cell differentiation.

TGFβ was first shown to induce epithelial-mesenchymal-transitions (EMTs) in immortalized mammary epithelial NMuMG cells. This differentiation from epithelial to fibroblastic phenotype was observed within 16 hours after addition of TGFβ1 and was accompanied by a decreased expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin, ZO-1, and desmoplakin I and II, an increased expression of mesenchymal fibronectin markers.

TGFβ plays an ambiguous role as it is both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter. Although TGFβ was originally purified from human placenta and platelets, most cells secrete it. Secretion of TGFβ is increased in many tumor cells which respond to TGFβ by enhanced invasiveness. This process, which contributes to metastasis formation, is due to an increased mesenchymal-transdifferentiation in epithelial cells.

## 13.2.4 EMT in Cancer Progression

Although the features of EMT were initially characterized in vitro, studies from patients with a variety of cancers have provided evidence for EMT in vivo. In human pancreatic tumor samples, fibronectin and vimentin are increased in high-grade tumors and within poorly differentiated areas of low-grade tumors, with a corresponding decrease in E-cadherin expression. Significantly, these patients have worse survival than those patients whose tumors demonstrate less evidence of EMT.

EMT has been shown to be a significant contributor to chemo-resistance in several cancers, including in pancreatic cancer. Induction of gemcitabine resistance in previously sensitive cell lines results in development of cells with an EMT phenotype that is associated with an increased migratory and invasive ability compared to gemcitabine sensitive cells.

The results of studies demonstrate participation of EMT in therapy resistance and in the development and maintenance of stemness potential in colorectal cancer. Evidence from preclinical and early clinical studies have shown that EMT markers might serve as outcome predictors and potential therapeutic targets in colorectal cancer.

## 13.2.5 EMT Detection in Human Cancer

To detect possible phenotypic transitions in human cancer, surgical pathology is a useful medical discipline, examining surgical or biopsy material at the microscopic and ultrastructural level. The expression in a particular tumor of epithelial and mesenchymal markers is evaluated by means of immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization, and this could, besides directing to a correct diagnosis, substantiate a possible transdifferentiation.

Whereas EMT occurs in several stages of embryonic development and can be readily induced in (cancer) cell lines in vitro, in human cancer the phenomenon is rarely encountered. Carcinosarcoma is the tumor best studied, in which monoclonality of both epithelial and mesenchymal cell components strongly favors an EMT.

Aberrant de novo expression of N-cadherin has been noted in carcinomas from the breast, prostate, bladder and the head and neck region, where it parallels a downregulation of E-cadherin and a decrease in tumor differentiation. In breast carcinoma cell lines N-cadherin expression is associated with an increased invasion potential.
