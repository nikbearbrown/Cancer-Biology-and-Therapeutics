## 13.8.1 Integrin-Mediated Invasion

Several integrins, such as β1, β3, β4 and β5 may be affected by HGF-mediated regulation of integrin avidity. The interactions between bone matrix proteins and invading breast cancer cells are pivotal because bone is a typical site of breast cancer metastasis. Integrins αVβ3 and αVβ5 are involved in bone sialoprotein-induced cancer cell adhesion, proliferation and migration.

It has been proposed that laminin receptors, especially integrin α6β1 are involved in metastatic processes, possibly during extravasation. Multiple binding epitopes on α6β1 may contribute to the migratory and adhesive properties mediated by this integrin. Intravenously injected anti-α6 integrin antibody inhibited the formation of lung metastases of a highly invasive mouse melanoma cell line.

Integrin α3β1 is involved in breast cancer cell migration and invasion by regulating the production of MMP-2. It may also participate in the rearrangement of cytoskeleton. Both phenomena are PI3-kinase dependent. Moreover, the expression of α3β1 integrin is reported to be related to the metastatic capacity of breast cancer cells by increasing the activity of MMP-9.

## 13.8.2 Cell Adhesion and Junction Disruption

Such data shows that HGF disrupts TJ function in human breast cancer cells by effecting changes in the expression of TJ molecules at both the mRNA and protein levels and that regulation of TJ could be of fundamental importance in the prevention of metastasis of breast cancer cells.

Regulation of vascular permeability is one of the most important functions of endothelial cells, and endothelial cells from different organ sites show different degrees of permeability. Tumor blood vessels are more permeable on macro-molecular diffusion than normal tissue vessels. Tumor cells release a number of factors that can assist their transmigration through the endothelium after treating endothelial cells with conditioned media from a highly invasive and metastatic melanoma cell line, with TJ being irreversibly damaged.

## 13.8.3 Adhesion Molecules in Metastasis

VCAM 1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) has been reported in secondary lung masses from breast cancer. It is expressed in endothelial cells. Upon activation, it initiates trans-endothelial migration by binding specific integrins, which in turn induce the activation of the GTPase Ras-related c3 botulinum toxin substrate. The activation of GTPases modifies the cytoskeleton network and facilitates cell migration.

Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) acts as the mediator of lung metastases. It recruits macrophages, which, in turn, secrete epidermal growth factor. This is followed by CSF1 secretion by tumor cells and further recruitment of macrophages. The presence of macrophages indicates a highly invasive potential.
