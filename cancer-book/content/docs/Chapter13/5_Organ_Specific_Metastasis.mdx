title: 13.5 Organ-Specific Metastasis
---


Tumors' histologic, genetic, and pathologic features guide them to metastasize to specific sites. Different cancers have distinct patterns of metastatic spread that reflect both biological and anatomical factors.

## 13.5.1 Lung Metastasis

Metastasis is the spread of tumor cells from primary sites to surrounding structures and distant sites. It is considered a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Distant metastasis is an indicative marker of the aggressive nature of the primary tumor. Metastasis in the lung is a complex multistep process. Metastatic tumor cells undergo stages of detachment from the primary tumor sites, invasion into vessels (capillary, lymphatics), extravasation into the appropriate secondary site, and establishment of a microenvironment supporting its nourishment and blood supply.

Common cancers that metastasize to lung parenchyma include breast, lung, colorectal cancer, uterine leiomyosarcoma, and head/neck squamous cell carcinomas. Cancers that spread to the endobronchial tree of the lungs include colorectal, renal, lung cancer, and lymphomas. Other tumors that can metastasize to the lungs include osteosarcoma and testicular tumors.

Tumors spread to the lungs either by hematogenous or lymphatic route or by direct invasion. Hematogenous spread: seen in tumors with venous drainage into lungs, eg, head and neck, thyroid, adrenals, kidneys, testes, melanoma, and osteosarcoma. Lymphatic spread occurs in 2 ways: antegrade invasion through the diaphragm or pleural surfaces or retrograde spread from hilar nodal metastases.

The lung is the second most frequent site of metastatic focus. It is estimated that 20 to 54% of malignant tumors developing elsewhere in our body would have pulmonary metastasis. Patients with metastasis to the lung have clinical prognoses and treatment options very different from their primary tumor.

## 13.5.2 Brain Metastasis

Brain metastases are a common complication of cancer and the most common type of brain tumor. Anywhere from 10% to 26% of patients who die from their cancer will develop brain metastases. Primary cancers such as lung, breast, and melanoma are most likely to metastasize to the brain.

The incidence of brain metastases is increasingly likely as a result of several factors. Patients with a systemic metastatic disease have a longer survival with new systemic therapies (including immunotherapy) that have recently seen more widespread use. Furthermore, the growing use of sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has contributed to the better detection of small asymptomatic brain metastases.

Metastatic cancer passes through the bloodstream and enters the central nervous system through a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Clonal cells then proliferate, causing local mass effect and edema. Due to the important role of the CNS, there are numerous mechanisms the body employs to protect this sensitive component. Physical and cellular components, such as the blood-brain-barrier and astrocytes, protect the brain from foreign and potentially hazardous infiltrates.

## 13.5.3 Spinal Metastasis

Spinal metastases are the most common tumors of the spine, comprising approximately 90% of masses encountered with spinal imaging. Spinal metastases are more commonly found as bone metastasis, although they are not limited to bone metastasis, and approximately 20% present with symptoms of spinal canal invasion and cord compression.

The most common primary malignancies predominantly metastasizing to the spine include the following tumors in descending order: breast (21%), lung (19%), prostate (7.5%), renal (5%), gastrointestinal (4.5%), and thyroid (2.5%). While all tumors can seed to the spine, the cancers mentioned above metastasize to the spinal column early in the disease process.

Among the routes mentioned above, hematogenous spread through Batson's plexus system is the most common pathway for tumor embolization and spinal invasion. Within the spinal column, metastasis is more commonly found in the thoracic region, followed by the lumbar region, while the cervical region is the least likely place professionals find metastasis.

## 13.5.4 Peritoneal Metastasis

Cancer cell metastasis is a complex phenomenon involving a multistage process and multidirectional spread. Dissemination, adhesion, invasion, and proliferation are significant steps in developing peritoneal metastasis from any primary source. Primary malignant cells can spread to distal sites through local invasion, lymphatics, or blood. In the case of peritoneal metastasis, malignant cells originating from primary abdominal organs usually spread through a transcoelomic mechanism.

The term peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) generally refers to the metastatic involvement of the peritoneum. The name was first coined in 1931 by Sampson to thoroughly describe metastatic involvement of the peritoneal stromal surface by ovarian cancer cells. Since then, it has referred to almost any peritoneal metastatic deposits. Metastatic cancer of the peritoneum is more common than a primary peritoneal malignancy.

Peritoneal involvement is most common with cancers of the gastrointestinal (GI), reproductive, and genitourinary tracts. Ovarian, colon, and gastric cancers are by far the most common conditions presenting in advanced stages with peritoneal metastasis. Cancers involving other organs such as the pancreas, appendix, small intestine, endometrium, and prostate can also cause peritoneal metastasis, but such occur less frequently.
