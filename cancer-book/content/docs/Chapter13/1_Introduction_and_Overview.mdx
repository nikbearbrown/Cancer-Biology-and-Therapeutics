Invasion and metastasis are the most insidious and life-threatening aspects of cancer. The capacity for invasion may not be expressed initially or in all tumors. Those tumors with minimal or no invasion may be extirpated successfully leading to cure in some patients. However, most cancers gradually unmask their invasive potential: progressing over time to frank malignancy from preexisting carcinoma in situ, adenomas, or disorders of epithelial proliferation.

Once the neoplasm becomes invasive, it can disseminate via the lymphatics and/or vascular channels that it induces through tumor-stimulated lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis and other perturbations of the local microenvironment. Invasion and metastases kill hosts through two processes: local invasion and distant organ colonization and injury.

## 13.1.1 The Metastatic Cascade

Metastasis is the leading reason for the resultant mortality of patients with cancer. The course of tumor metastasis entails a series of stages that lead to the formation of secondary tumors in distant organs and is, largely, responsible for the mortality and morbidity of cancer. The metastatic cascade can be broadly separated into three main processes: invasion, intravasation and extravasation.

Once tumor cells acquire the ability to penetrate the surrounding tissues, the process of invasion is instigated as these motile cells pass through the basement membrane and extracellular matrix, progressing to intravasation as they penetrate the lymphatic or vascular circulation. The metastatic cells then journey through the circulatory system invading the vascular basement membrane and extracellular matrix in the process of extravasation. Ultimately, these cells will attach at a new location and proliferate to produce the secondary tumor.

The loss of cell-cell adhesion capacity allows malignant tumor cells to dissociate from the primary tumor mass and changes in cell-matrix interaction enable the cells to invade the surrounding stroma. The metastatic procedure is an inefficient process whereby the vast majority of circulating tumor cells are not able to progressively grow at distant sites. In 1970 Fidler showed that in in vivo models after 24 h, only 0.01% of cancer cells released into the circulation survived to produce metastases.

## 13.1.2 Clinical Significance of Metastasis

At the time of cancer diagnosis, at least half of the patients already present clinically detectable metastatic disease. A higher number of patients will also have micrometastases that would be beyond conventional detection techniques. Thus, metastasis is the most life threatening event in patients with cancer.

The most significant turning point in cancer is the establishment of distant metastasis. The patient can no longer be cured by local therapy alone at this point. The patient with metastatic disease most commonly succumbs to injury caused by cancer dissemination. Approximately 30% or patients still will have clinically detectable metastases at the time of initial diagnosis, and a further 30 to 40% of patients will develop metastases later.

Tumors of comparable size and histology can have widely divergent metastatic potential, depending on their genotype and local environmental influences. Cancer is a disease of signaling, the aberrancy of signaling induced by genetic changes of mutation and transformation as well as the aberrant signaling ongoing in the local tumor microenvironment.
