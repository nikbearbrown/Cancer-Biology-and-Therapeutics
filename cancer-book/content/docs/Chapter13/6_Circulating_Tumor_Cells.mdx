title: 13.6 Circulating Tumor Cells
---


Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) represent cancer cells that have detached from the primary tumor and entered the bloodstream. These cells provide insights into the metastatic process and have clinical significance as biomarkers.

## 13.6.1 CTC Biology and Characteristics

In patients, the precise number of CTCs has not been well characterized (estimated 1:1 billion normal blood cells) and only a handful of these cells are considered viable metastatic precursors. Different cell clones, each derived from the same primary tumor, displayed differential metastatic potentials. This study fuelled the notion that only a small subpopulation of CTCs survive to establish heterogeneous metastases.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are frequently enriched in advanced and aggressive tumors, and cells isolated from distant metastases often show a CSC phenotype. CSCs were originally identified mainly using metastatic samples provided the preliminary evidence for the existence of CSCs in metastasis.

The majority of early disseminated cancer cells detected in the bone marrow of breast cancer patients showed a CD44+CD24 phenotype; their relative percentage went up to 65% in metastasis compared with less than 10% in primary tumor. CD44+ prostate cancer CSCs also showed a high metastatic propensity compared with CD44 cells.

## 13.6.2 CTC Detection and Clinical Significance

A higher number of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in peripheral blood indicates poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. The unfavorable count (presence of 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 ml peripheral blood) was associated with poor overall survival in patients with prostate cancer. CTC counts can be used as an accurate and independent predictor of survival rate in patients with prostate cancer.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) represent a biomarker for tumor progression and monitoring therapeutic effects. Changes in CTC count and the pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) for local advanced breast cancer (LABC) patients have been evaluated, though the association between changes in CTC number during treatment and pathological complete response remains complex.

## 13.6.3 CTC Survival in Circulation

The vasculature induced by cancer cells is crooked, leaky and constantly reconfigured. Once the cancer cells cross the blood-brain-barrier, they must survive in the circulatory system, which poses three unique stresses: lack of adhesion sites, strong hemodynamic force, and the innate immune system.

When a cell is deprived of the ECM to use as an anchor, it is programmed to undergo anoikis, a type of cell death. Cancer cells must be able to overcome this innate response to survive in the blood stream. Additionally, the physical force of the circulatory system and the response of the innate immune system create additional survival challenges for circulating tumor cells.
