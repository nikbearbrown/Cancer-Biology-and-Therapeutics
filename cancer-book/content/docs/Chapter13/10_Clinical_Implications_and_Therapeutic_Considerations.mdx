## 13.10.1 Metastasis Prevention Strategies

Some neoplasms produce early metastases almost constantly, such as: osteosarcomas, tonsillar carcinomas, oropharyngeal melanomas, splenic sarcomas, etc. In other cancers, metastases are exceptional and occur at a late stage. This is the case of the basocellular epithelioma, Sticker's sarcoma, seminoma, etc.

It should be mentioned that only a small part of the tumor cells that reach blood circulation have metastatic properties, and only when they find favorable conditions. Depending on the metastasizing subclone, the cellular structure of metastases is similar or different, compared to the primary tumor. The involvement of the host tissue in the development of a tumor is strongly expressed by the growth rhythm and the possibilities of tumor metastasizing.

## 13.10.2 Staging and Prognosis

The system of cancer staging codifies and describes for each type of cancer the extent of tumor spread. A truly effective cancer staging system not only aids in the description of the extent of the cancer, but also will provide prognostic information (likelihood of cure) and will thus influence therapeutic decision-making.

For every distinct type of cancer based on the organ of origin and histology, there is a distinct staging formula using the TNM staging system. T represents tumor size or depth of invasion; N represents lymph node involvement, M represents distant metastases. The size of the primary tumor does have an effect on the likelihood of future metastases.

## 13.10.3 Therapeutic Targets

A number of studies suggest that distinct TGFβ signaling pathways regulate growth inhibition and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition. This raises the fascinating possibility that antagonists specific for the EMT pathway might be generated, that do not affect the control of cell proliferation. Under such circumstances, one could envision drugs for cancer therapy which would provide a block to metastasis spreading, while keeping the powerful capacity of TGFβ to control cell proliferation.

However, the complex heterogeneity of tumors and the reversible plasticity of EMT, which is fundamental for tumor progression and drug resistance, are principal obstacles in the reproduction of clinical cancer progression. Therefore, further research to establish new biomarkers for EMT, with special emphasis on partial EMT as well as a better understanding of how EMT and therapy resistance are interconnected, is imperative for the development of new therapeutic approaches.
