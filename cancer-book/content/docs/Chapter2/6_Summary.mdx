This chapter has provided a comprehensive overview of cancer as a disease of deregulation based exclusively on verified sources from NCBI Bookshelf. Cancer cells break the most basic rules of behavior by which multicellular organisms are built and maintained, and they exploit every kind of opportunity to do so.

Key principles that emerge from this exploration include:

1. **Cancer as Uncontrolled Growth**: Cancer begins when a cell breaks free from the normal restraints on cell division and begins to follow its own agenda for proliferation.

2. **Multistep Development**: Carcinogenesis can be divided conceptually into four steps: tumor initiation, tumor promotion, malignant conversion, and tumor progression.

3. **Hallmarks Framework**: The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumours. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease.

4. **Prevention Potential**: More than 90% of cancers are directly attributable to environmental and lifestyle factors, making them largely preventable.

5. **Historical Progress**: In the United States, a definitive effort to combat cancer and advance scientific research began with the establishment of the National Cancer Institute in 1937.

Understanding cancer as both a cellular and systemic disease provides the foundation for developing effective prevention, detection, and treatment strategies. The subsequent chapters will build upon this foundation to explore specific aspects of cancer biology, diagnosis, and therapeutic approaches, all grounded in evidence from authoritative medical literature.
