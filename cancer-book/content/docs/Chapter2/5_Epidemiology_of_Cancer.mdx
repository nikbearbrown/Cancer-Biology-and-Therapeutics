## 2.5.1 Global Cancer Burden

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, second only to heart disease in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 606,520 cancer deaths, and new cancer cases in 2020 were expected to exceed 1.8 million. Globally, nearly 20 million new cancer cases and almost 10 million deaths are reported annually.

In the first systematic collation of global high-quality cancer incidence data, in the 1960s, stomach cancer was the most common cancer type worldwide. Stomach cancer is now the fifth most common cancer type globally, with an estimated 1 million new cases in 2018 (5.7% of new cancer cases).

## 2.5.2 Risk Factors for Cancer

More than 90% of cancers are directly attributable to environmental and lifestyle factors, making them largely preventable.

**Tobacco Use**

TOBACCO, through its various forms of exposure, constitutes the main cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide among men, and increasingly among women. Forms of exposure include active smoking, breathing secondhand tobacco smoke (passive or involuntary smoking) and smokeless tobacco.

The most significant modifiable risk factor for bladder cancers is tobacco smoking. Smoking has been shown to increase the risk of developing bladder cancer by up to four times, with mortality from bladder cancer due to smoking is only second to lung cancer due to smoking.

**Diet, Physical Activity, and Obesity**

PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, DIETARY FACTORS, OBESITY AND BEING OVERWEIGHT play an important role as causes of cancer. These factors are affected by gender norms. Because all these factors are intimately interconnected at the individual and contextual levels, estimating the specific contribution of each of these risk factors is difficult and might underestimate the cumulative potential risk.

**Alcohol Consumption**

ALCOHOL USE is a risk factor for many cancer types including cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colorectum and breast. Risk of cancer increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.

**Infectious Agents**

Chronic HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) infection (chronic hepatitis) causes about 52% of the world's hepatocellular carcinomas, resulting in nearly 340 000 deaths per year.

**Radiation**

Exposure to natural radiation is largely a result of radon gas in homes, which increases the risk of lung cancer. Non-ionizing radiation comprises electromagnetic fields like those emitted by mobile phones or power lines and ultraviolet radiation (mainly from the sun), the latter causing chromosomal damages.

## 2.5.3 Cancer Prevention and Screening

**Primary Prevention**

A 19 percent decline in the rate at which new cancer cases occur and a 29 percent decline in the rate of cancer deaths could potentially be achieved by 2015 if efforts to help people change their behaviors that put them at risk were stepped up and if behavioral change were sustained.

**Secondary Prevention (Screening)**

A complementary strategy to preventing the occurrence of cancer (primary prevention) is early detection of cancer through screening (secondary prevention). The fundamental tenet of screening for cancer is that finding the disease before symptoms develop enables detection at a less advanced stage and that instituting treatment at that time leads ultimately to improved health outcomes.

Cancer screening markers are defined as tests. When systematically applied to populations, they identify asymptomatic individuals at sufficient risk of cancer to justify use of additional markers or clinical intervention.

Fortunately, early screening for cancers such as colon, lung, cervical, breast, and prostate can delay or halt disease progression, increase cure rates, and reduce morbidity and mortality.

**Screening Effectiveness**

Of these, only breast mammography, the cervical PAP test, and colorectal FOB testing have been demonstrated to reduce site-specific cancer mortality when applied as a screening measure in the general population.

Since the early 1970s alone, the incidence and mortality for cervical cancer have dropped by approximately 40 percent, a decrease most likely due to increased screening by Pap tests and the use of effective treatment.

## 2.5.4 Cancer Survivorship

Second primary cancers have become an increasingly important concern in oncology during the last two decades, as they now comprise the sixth most common group of malignancies after skin, prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal cancers.

What was formerly a problem primarily in pediatric cancer survivors and for the survivors of the more curable adult cancers has become a more universal problem in the present-day practice of oncology. Survivors of all cancers are living for longer periods, partly because of the more frequent use of effective therapy.
