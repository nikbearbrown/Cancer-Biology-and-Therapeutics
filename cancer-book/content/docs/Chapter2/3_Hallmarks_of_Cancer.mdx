 title: 2.3 Hallmarks of Cancer
---


Currently, the most widely recognized description of the nature of cancer is that presented by Hanahan and Weinberg in two reviews – published more than a decade apart – that identify the "hallmarks" of cancer.

## 2.3.1 Original Hallmarks of Cancer

Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by diverse molecular signatures, yet all share common cellular phenotypic traits and functional capabilities. Hanahan and Weinberg identified these traits as the hallmarks of cancer, which include increased cell proliferation, achieved through sustained proliferative signaling or evasion of growth suppressors.

Second, it is now understood that specific hallmarks of cancer cells cause the clinically evident tumor mass and are fundamental to developing and maintaining the malignant state, including metastases. These include resistance to apoptosis; the ability to replicate indefinitely (immortality); the ability to invade and metastasize; accelerated proliferation, including resistance to growth-stopping signals; and sustained angiogenesis.

## 2.3.2 Emerging Hallmarks

Two enabling characteristics facilitate the acquisition of these traits: genomic instability and tumor-promoting inflammation. Additionally, deregulated tumor metabolism has emerged as a defining feature of cancer cells.

The malignant tumor also has an altered metabolism, including accelerated glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and lipid synthesis.

## 2.3.3 Clinical Implications of Cancer Hallmarks

Moreover, identifying cancer hallmarks has redefined the understanding of carcinogenesis, providing a more comprehensive view of cancer as a process driven by the accumulation of these hallmarks.
