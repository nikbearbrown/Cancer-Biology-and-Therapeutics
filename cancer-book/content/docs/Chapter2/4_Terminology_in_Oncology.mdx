2.4 Terminology in Oncology

## 2.4.1 Classification of Neoplasms

The most important issue in cancer pathology is the distinction between benign and malignant tumors. Benign tumors usually don't cause much damage and aren't normally life-threatening. But there's no guarantee: Benign growths may sometimes become malignant after some time.

**Benign vs. Malignant**

A tumor, or mass of cells, formed of these abnormal cells may remain within the tissue in which it originated (a condition called in situ cancer), or it may begin to invade nearby tissues (a condition called invasive cancer). An invasive tumor is said to be malignant, and cells shed into the blood or lymph from a malignant tumor are likely to establish new tumors (metastases).

**Tissue of Origin**

Different types of cancers arise from different tissues:
- Carcinomas: Derived from epithelial tissues
- Sarcomas: Arise from mesenchymal tissues
- Hematologic malignancies: Include leukemias and lymphomas

## 2.4.2 Staging Systems

Stage distribution of prostate cancer is affected substantially by the intensity of early detection efforts. Cancer statistics from the National Cancer Institute indicated that between 2014 and 2020, the proportion of disease diagnosed at a locoregional stage was 82%, and the proportion of disease diagnosed as distant disease was 8%.

## 2.4.3 Patterns of Spread

When cancer cells replicate and divide, they don't behave like normal cells. For example, they don't "know" when to stop replicating and when to die. And they don't always stick together. This means that they might break away, move through the blood vessels or lymphatic system, and start growing somewhere else in the body. That is known as metastasis.
