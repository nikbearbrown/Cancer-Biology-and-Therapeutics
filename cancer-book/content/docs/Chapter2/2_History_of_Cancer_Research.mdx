 title: 2.2 History of Cancer Research
---


References to cancer can be found in historical records as far back as 1700 BC, including the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, the ancient Egyptian Ebers and Smith Papyrus, and the Chinese Rites of the Zhou Dynasty. Early mentions of cancer are also documented in medieval Islamic texts and the ancient Indian Ramayana.

### 2.2.1 Early Observations and Theories

Humankind has studied benign and malignant tumors since ancient times, speculating on their causes. Recent findings by Randolph-Quinney et al support the ancient origins of cancer, with the discovery of osteosarcoma in a hominin foot bone over one million years old in South Africaâ€”suggesting that cancer has been present as long as humanity itself.

### 2.2.2 The Emergence of Scientific Oncology

At the beginning of the 20th century, cancer was eighth among the leading causes of death. Infectious diseases were prominent, with pneumonia, influenza, tuberculosis, and gastrointestinal diseases being responsible for one-third of all deaths.

At the beginning of the century, cases of lung cancer was so rare that it was shown to medical students as a condition that the students were unlikely to see again during their medical practices. By the 1940s, however, lung cancer was becoming quite common.

### 2.2.3 The National Cancer Institute Era

In the United States, a definitive effort to combat cancer and advance scientific research began with the establishment of the National Cancer Institute in 1937. This initiative gained further momentum with the passage of the National Cancer Act in 1971.

In 1937 the National Cancer Institute Act established the National Cancer Institute (NCI) within the U.S. Public Health Service. The Act directed the Surgeon General to promote the coordination of research conducted by the Institute and similar research conducted by other agencies, organizations, and individuals.
