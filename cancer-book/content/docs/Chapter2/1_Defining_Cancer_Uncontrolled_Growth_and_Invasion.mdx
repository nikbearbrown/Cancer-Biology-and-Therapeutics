 title: 2.1 Defining Cancer - Uncontrolled Growth and Invasion
---


The fundamental abnormality resulting in the development of cancer is the continual unregulated proliferation of cancer cells. Rather than responding appropriately to the signals that control normal cell behavior, cancer cells grow and divide in an uncontrolled manner, invading normal tissues and organs and eventually spreading throughout the body. In simple terms, cancer is a group of more than 100 diseases that develop across time and involve the uncontrolled division of the body's cells.

## 2.1.1 Cancer as a Cellular Disease

What happens to cause a cell to become cancerous? Thirty years ago, scientists could not offer a coherent answer to this question. They knew that cancer arose from cells that began to proliferate uncontrollably within the body, and they knew that chemicals, radiation, and viruses could trigger this change. But exactly how it happened was a mystery. Research across the last three decades, however, has revolutionized our understanding of cancer.

The generalized loss of growth control exhibited by cancer cells is the net result of accumulated abnormalities in multiple cell regulatory systems and is reflected in several aspects of cell behavior that distinguish cancer cells from their normal counterparts.

## 2.1.2 The Multistep Process of Carcinogenesis

Carcinogenesis can be divided conceptually into four steps: tumor initiation, tumor promotion, malignant conversion, and tumor progression. Cancer usually develops through the transformation of normal cells into malignant tumor cells, often progressing from a precancerous condition to a fully developed tumor.

A central feature of today's molecular view of cancer is that cancer does not develop all at once, but across time, as a long and complex succession of genetic changes. Each change enables precancerous cells to acquire some of the traits that together create the malignant growth of cancer cells.

The stages of carcinogenesis include:

1. **Initiation**: After initiation, carcinogenesis advances through the promotion and progression stages. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the initiation phase is crucial for developing strategies to prevent, detect, and treat cancer.

2. **Promotion**: The expansion of initiated cells through enhanced proliferation or reduced apoptosis.

3. **Progression**: Tumor progression comprises the expression of the malignant phenotype and the tendency of malignant cells to acquire more aggressive characteristics over time.

## 2.1.3 Distinguishing Characteristics of Malignancy

Cancer can result from abnormal proliferation of any of the different kinds of cells in the body, so there are more than a hundred distinct types of cancer, which can vary substantially in their behavior and response to treatment.

**Uncontrolled Proliferation**

When either of these proteins is not functioning correctly, downstream elements are not properly functioning, such as the INK4a/ARF, which encodes for tumor suppressor proteins. However, tumors may grow, leading to cancer in these specific cells.

**Cellular Atypia**

Morphologically, the cancerous cell is characterized by a large nucleus, having an irregular size and shape, the nucleoli are prominent, the cytoplasm is scarce and intensely colored or, on the contrary, is pale.

**Altered Metabolism**

The cancerous cell is particularly characterized by a poor use of oxygen and the massive use of glucose, which is exclusively converted to lactic acid. Consequently, malignant cells take from blood a 5â€“10 fold glucose amount compared to normal cells and they produce a corresponding lactic acid amount that will be recycled and changed back to glucose in the liver.

## 2.1.4 Cancer as a Systemic Disease

Tumors threaten an individual's life when their growth disrupts the tissues and organs needed for survival.
