## 32.2.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors

**Incidence and Demographics**:
Meningioma is a known benign central nervous system tumor commonly arising from the meninges of the brain and spinal cord. About 68% of all brain and central nervous system tumours are non-malignant; about half of these tumours are meningiomas, followed by pituitary tumours and nerve sheath tumours.

**Risk Factors**:
Although obesity has not been consistently associated with risk of glioma, there is a consensus that obesity is associated with risk of meningioma. Various genetic susceptibility loci have been identified for gliomas, and two distinct susceptibility loci have been associated with meningiomas.

**Ionizing Radiation**:
Ionizing radiation and the risk of brain and central nervous system tumors represents a well-established risk factor for meningioma development.

## 32.2.2 Pathophysiology and Classification

**Cellular Origin**:
Intraventricular meningiomas show similar characteristics to those found in the extra-axial space. Their cells of origin are the same; however, extra-axial meningiomas are derived from the arachnoid cap cells, naturally occurring near venous sinuses and dural edges. Intraventricular meningiomas originate from the choroid plexus' stroma and arise at the tela choroidea.

**WHO Grading System**:
Meningioma is classified into three grades, according to the World Health Organization. Most meningiomas are considered to be benign World Health Organization (WHO) grade I, slow-growing lesions.

**Grade I (Benign)**:
The majority of meningiomas are WHO Grade I tumors, characterized by slow growth and favorable prognosis with complete surgical resection.

**Grade II (Atypical)**:
Grade 2 are atypical lesions characterized by three or more of the following: necrosis, sheet-like growth, prominent nuclei, increased cellularity, or high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio. An increased mitotic activity (4-19 mitoses per 10 high-power fields) will also indicate an atypical tumor. A meningioma with brain invasion is now considered a grade 2 tumor.

**Grade III (Anaplastic)**:
Grade 3 are anaplastic, malignant lesions that can be similar to high-grade sarcomas, carcinoma, or melanomas with a high rate of distant metastases. A high mitotic activity (20 or more mitoses per 10 high-power fields) will also indicate a grade 3 lesion.

**Cystic Variants**:
Cystic meningioma represents a meningioma with intratumoral or peritumoral cysts. The classification system includes four types based on cyst location and characteristics.

## 32.2.3 Clinical Presentation

**Symptom Presentation**:
Since most patients with meningioma are asymptomatic, the management is usually done with close observation and follow-up with serial imaging. However, symptomatic patients usually require surgery to lower the risk of recurrence and severity of the disease.

**Location-Specific Symptoms**:
The clinical presentation of meningiomas depends significantly on their location within the CNS. Symptoms may include headaches, seizures, focal neurological deficits, or cognitive changes, depending on the anatomical structures affected.

**Optic Nerve Sheath Meningiomas**:
The natural history of ONSM is characterized by slowly painless and progressive visual loss in the affected eye. If left untreated, this tumor can lead to complete blindness. Visual loss, optic atrophy, and optociliary shunt vessels is the classic triad in patients with an ONSM but most patients do not present the three components.

## 32.2.4 Diagnostic Approaches

**Imaging Characteristics**:
Advanced neuroimaging plays a crucial role in meningioma diagnosis and surgical planning. MRI with gadolinium enhancement typically shows characteristic features that help distinguish meningiomas from other CNS tumors.

**Histopathological Confirmation**:
Prompt diagnosis, as well as understanding the severity of the tumor, would aid in the better future management of the patient. Tissue diagnosis through biopsy or surgical resection provides definitive histopathological classification.

**Molecular Markers**:
Pathology and molecular genetics of meningioma: recent advances have improved our understanding of meningioma biology and may influence treatment decisions.

## 32.2.5 Treatment Strategies

**Surgical Management**:
For most people, complete surgical resection (Simpson grade 1 or 2 resection) of a meningioma is considered optimal treatment. However for many people their tumour is inoperable due to location (an attempt at resection would result in significant neurological deficit) or in such a position that resection would be incomplete to avoid neurological sequelae.

**Observation Strategy**:
Active surveillance is appropriate in some circumstances. With the increasing use of sensitive neuroimaging tools, detection of asymptomatic low-grade meningiomas has increased; most appear to show minimal growth and can often be safely observed, with therapy deferred until the detection of tumor growth or the development of symptoms.

**Intraventricular Meningiomas**:
Small asymptomatic lesions &lt;3cm are closely followed with brain MRI every six months for 1-2 years, and then once per year. For large asymptomatic lesions >3cm in young good surgical candidates, gross total resection is recommended as it is curative in most cases.

**Radiation Therapy**:
For these people the optimal timing of radiotherapy is unclear. In addition it is unclear if patients who have residual disease after surgical resection should have immediate adjuvant radiotherapy or wait until progressive growth occurs.

The committee therefore recommended that the radiotherapy technique selected should be the one which provides the least dose of radiation to the normal brain and the rest of the body, to reduce the risk of side effects of treatment, subject to that technique being appropriate in all other ways.

**Higher-Grade Meningiomas**:
The committee described how for higher-grade meningiomas the effectiveness of treatment decreased and they can regrow rapidly. The involvement of a comprehensive oncology team is necessary for malignant meningiomas to provide essential and amenable chemotherapies and radiation treatments.

## 32.2.6 Prognosis and Follow-up

**Recurrence Risk**:
The rate of recurrence and the risk of transformation to malignancy is dependent on the histopathological type of meningioma. Grade I meningiomas have excellent prognosis with complete resection, while higher-grade tumors carry increased risk of recurrence and malignant transformation.

**Surgical Outcomes**:
The recurrence and mortality are lower for intraventricular meningiomas than in other localizations. A higher complete surgical resection rate is achieved than in other localizations. Gross total resection is the gold standard for the treatment of intraventricular meningiomas.

**Complications**:
Many patients can present with deficits due to the tumor location. Postoperative reevaluation is needed as the surgical approach can cause new deficits. Some patients develop neurologic deficits primarily in visual fields.
