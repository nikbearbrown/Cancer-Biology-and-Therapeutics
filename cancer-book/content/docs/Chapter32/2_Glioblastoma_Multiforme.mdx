## 32.1.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) comprises glioma's most malignant and pervasive subtype. GBM is the most common primary brain tumor in adults, accounting for 45.2% of primary malignant brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors. There are an estimated 80,000 to 90,000 newly diagnosed cases of primary brain tumors each year in the United States, with approximately 25% being gliomas. The total number of glioblastoma cases diagnosed each year is about 12,000 (approximately 15% of the total of newly diagnosed brain tumors and roughly 50% of all malignant brain tumors).

**Age and Gender Distribution**:
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor. With an incidence rate of 3.19 per 100,000 persons in the United States and a median age of 64 years, it is uncommon in children. The incidence is 1.6 times higher in males compared to females and 2.0 times higher in Caucasians compared to Africans and Afro-Americans, with lower incidence in Asians and American Indians.

**Anatomical Distribution**:
GBM is commonly located in the supratentorial region (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes) and is rarely located in cerebellum. Overall, the incidence of GBM is higher in males than in females (3.97 vs. 2.53 in the United States).

**Risk Factors**:
The only well-established causative factor is exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation. Results from some epidemiological studies suggest that ionizing radiation can increase the chance of developing gliomas. Gliomas most often present in patients without any relevant history; however, some patients may have tumor-predisposition syndromes. The phacomatoses such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2 predispose patients to astrocytomas and ependymomas, respectively.

## 32.1.2 Pathophysiology and Molecular Biology

**Cellular Origin and Classification**:
Due to different triggering mutations and critical mutations in the GBM stem cells, GBM is classified into primary tumors arising from neural stem cell precursors and secondary tumors arising from mutations in mature neural cells like astrocytes. Glioblastoma is an extremely aggressive form of cancer most commonly derived from neural stem cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes that occurs in the brain and has a 5-year survival rate of 6.7%.

**Molecular Subtyping**:
The classification of GBM based on gene expression distinguishes between four subtypes: proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal. Aberrations and gene expression of EGFR, NF1, and PDGFRA/IDH1 define classical, mesenchymal, and proneural GBMs, respectively. Genes of normal brain cell types show a strong relationship between subtypes and different neural lineages and the response to aggressive treatment differs by subtype, with prominent benefits in the classical and little or no benefit in the proneural subtype.

**IDH Mutations**:
Interestingly, IDH1 mutations are also found in 80% of diffuse astrocytoma and anaplastic astrocytoma, the precursors of secondary GBM, and in less than 5% of primary GBM. According to the WHO 2021 recommendations for central nervous system tumors, astrocytomas are now diagnosed solely by IDH mutations. New to the 2021 recommendations, glioblastomas are now only IDH-wildtype tumors and no longer classified as IDH-mutant.

**Tumor Heterogeneity**:
Alteration in genetic information, causing expression and suppression of genes compared to their physiological levels in healthy brain cells, leads to cellular and extracellular matrix changes, resulting in a multiform number of biochemical forms. Hence, the name multiforme is due to the extent of genotypic diversity. Glioblastomas are complex heterogeneous tumors that have the ability to adapt and build resistance against existing treatments.

## 32.1.3 Clinical Presentation

**Symptom Categories**:
A thorough history of patients with astrocytoma is a critical component of the diagnostic process, providing valuable insights into symptoms' onset, progression, and nature. Symptoms can be divided into 2 categories: general and focal. General symptoms include headache (usually early morning), nausea, vomiting, cognitive difficulties, personality changes, and gait disorders. Localizing symptoms include seizures, aphasia, or visual field defects.

**Specific Manifestations**:
The most common symptoms of glioblastomas are loss of vision, numbness, and headaches, usually accompanied by nausea or vomiting. These symptoms may be overlooked or mistaken for another disease, which is why glioblastomas are commonly detected in later stages when they begin their widespread infiltration of the brain.

**Seizures and Neurological Deficits**:
About 50% of patients with supratentorial brain tumors may present with seizures. A visual field defect is often unnoticed by the patient and may be revealed after it leads to injury, such as motor vehicle accidents. Once the tumors have developed, 60% of patients experience short seizures, between 2–3 minutes of duration, and suffer from fatigue, confusion, and numbness once the seizure has concluded.

## 32.1.4 Diagnostic Approaches

**Imaging Characteristics**:
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows poorly circumscribed marginal enhancement. Central hypointensity in T1 due to necrosis and peripheral hyperintensities in T2/FLAIR sequences due to edema are salient MRI features. MR spectroscopy has a choline peak.

**Histopathological Diagnosis**:
The definitive diagnosis is made through a histopathological examination that reveals poorly differentiated pleomorphic cells. The differential diagnosis of GBM poses a significant challenge due to its overlapping clinical and radiological features with other brain tumors and non-neoplastic conditions.

**Multidisciplinary Evaluation**:
The urgency of neurosurgical evaluation depends on whether the patient is clinically stable, the symptoms' severity, and the tumor's size and location. Preoperative evaluation includes MRI and diffusion tensor imaging.

## 32.1.5 Treatment Strategies

**Surgical Management**:
The goal of surgery is the maximum safe resection to preserve neurological function with improved survival. Since GBM infiltrates surrounding structures, GTR is not always possible. Data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) suggest GTR and STR are associated with improved survival compared to biopsy alone or no surgical intervention.

In a multicenter trial including 314 patients who underwent resection of a newly diagnosed glioblastoma, the complete resection rate was similar for intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) or 5-aminolevulinic acid (81% and 78%, respectively). In a trial of iMRI versus conventional neuronavigation, iMRI use led to better PFS.

**Adjuvant Treatment**:
Current approved therapies include surgical resection followed by a combination of radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide, and more recently tumor-treating (TT) fields. GBM's gold-standard treatment comprises surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiochemotherapy.

**Chemotherapy**:
Temozolomide is an oral alkylating agent converted to 3-methyl-(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC) at physiologic pH. This agent is 100% bioavailable, and approximately 35% crosses the blood-brain barrier. Based on the CATNON trial, adjuvant treatment consists of 12 monthly cycles, beginning 1 month after radiotherapy completion.

**Treatment Challenges**:
However, there are many limitations with the current treatment strategies due to several resistance mechanisms varying from low concentrations of chemotherapeutics crossing the blood brain barrier to increased risk of temozolomide resistance in a sub-set of patients.

## 32.1.6 Prognosis and Complications

**Survival Outcomes**:
It remains an incurable disease with a median survival of 15 months and has been classified into wild-type and mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) subtypes. The average survival for patients is approximately 12–15 months, and relative survival is extremely low, with less than 5% of all patients surviving 5 years post-diagnosis, with this value decreasing to 2% among patients aged 65 years or older.

**Recurrence Patterns**:
Recurrence after GTR and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy mainly occurs within the peritumoral brain zone (PBZ) bearing the malignant microenvironment containing tumor cells, angiogenesis-related endothelial cells, reactive astrocytes, glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and glioma-associated stromal cells (GASCs). High local recurrence rates (80% to 90%) are observed within 2 cm of the original tumor.

**Treatment-Related Complications**:
GBM is usually associated with pseudoprogression or radionecrosis, which is a subacute worsening of MRI findings that occur within 3 months after the completion of chemoradiotherapy. It is a treatment-related effect. The risk of surgical site infection increases with irradiation and multiple surgeries.

## 32.1.7 Pediatric Considerations

**Epidemiology in Children**:
Glioblastoma in children, when compared with adults, is relatively rare. In contrast, GBM accounts for no more than 3–15% of primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors in children. This is despite the fact that CNS tumors are the most common solid tumors of childhood, and 40–50% of these tumors are constituted by the astrocytomas.

**Prognosis in Children**:
The reported median survival in p-GBM ranges from 13 to 73 months with a 5-year survival of less than 20%. A few reports, however, reveal a relatively better prognosis and long-term survival figures in p-GBM as compared with adults.
