Central nervous system (CNS) tumors represent a diverse group of neoplasms that originate within the brain and spinal cord. These tumors present unique challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to their location within the anatomically complex and functionally critical nervous system. In 2018, cancer of the brain and central nervous system was the 17th most common cancer type, with an estimated 297,000 new cases worldwide. Understanding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical management of CNS tumors is essential for healthcare providers, as these conditions significantly impact patient quality of life and require specialized multidisciplinary care.

About 68% of all brain and central nervous system tumours are non-malignant; about half of these tumours are meningiomas, followed by pituitary tumours and nerve sheath tumours. Among the malignant tumours, heterogeneity is also substantial; almost half of these are glioblastomas, followed by other gliomas. This chapter focuses on the two most clinically significant CNS tumors: glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive primary brain tumor, and meningiomas, the most common non-malignant brain tumor.
