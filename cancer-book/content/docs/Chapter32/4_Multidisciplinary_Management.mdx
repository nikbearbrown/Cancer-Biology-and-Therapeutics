## 32.3.1 Team-Based Approach

**Neurosurgical Team**:
Formulating a treatment plan requires a multidisciplinary team, including surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists. This activity highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in the management of patients suffering from meningiomas.

**Specialized Expertise**:
Meningiomas involving the paranasal sinuses or the temporal bone may require an otorhinolaryngologist or a craniomaxillofacial surgeon. Moreover, since temporal bone meningiomas can cause hearing deficits, it is crucial to evaluate auditory function.

**Supportive Care**:
Dexamethasone, mannitol, and furosemide are used to treat the peritumoral edema associated with brain tumors. The use of anticonvulsants is mandatory for patients with seizures.

## 32.3.2 Advanced Techniques

**Surgical Technology**:
The use of functional brain mapping, diffusion tensor imaging, and tractography of white matter fiber tracts can help to select the best appropriate approach. Neuronavigation can be used to plan and verify the exact trajectory of the surgery.

**Adjuvant Interventions**:
Sometimes, complete resection can prove difficult due to vascular control being deep to the tumor, and pre-operative endovascular embolization should be attempted.

## 32.3.3 Patient Education and Counseling

**Informed Decision-Making**:
Clarifying patients' goals of care is essential as soon as the diagnosis is made, given the poor prognosis even with complete treatment. The patient should be educated about the management and prognosis of ONSMs as they are slowly progressive. Patients need to have clear information so they can make informed decisions about their tumors.

**Genetic Counseling**:
Offer genetic counseling for patients with a family history of brain tumors to assess potential hereditary risks.
