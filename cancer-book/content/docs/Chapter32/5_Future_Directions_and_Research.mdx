## 32.4.1 Molecular Therapeutics

**Targeted Therapy Development**:
In recent years, novel therapies and delivery systems have been developed to overcome these limitations. This therefore prompts the need for new therapies that have the capacity to target various pathways so that they remain effective against all subpopulations in the tumor.

**Immunotherapy**:
GBM shows features of immune escape and high tumor heterogeneity. Moreover, the relative immune privileged milieu owing to the lack of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and lymphatics within the CNS further contributes to the poor prognosis among cohorts with GBM.

## 32.4.2 Precision Medicine

**Molecular Classification**:
For decades, histologic diagnosis of these tumors provided a valuable foundation for assessing prognosis and guiding therapeutic management. The integration of molecular markers with traditional histopathological classification is revolutionizing CNS tumor diagnosis and treatment.

**Personalized Treatment**:
Molecular diagnosis will contribute to a better understanding and classification of brain tumors. Future therapeutic approaches will increasingly rely on molecular profiling to guide treatment decisions.

## 32.4.3 Prevention and Risk Reduction

**Lifestyle Modifications**:
Encourage healthy lifestyle choices, including proper nutrition and exercise, and avoid known risk factors like ionizing radiation exposure.

**Environmental Factors**:
Many potential risk factors have been studied, but most remain classified as "probably not risk factors". These include head injuries, occupational exposures, residential power-frequency electromagnetic fields, dental X-rays, tobacco smoke, and alcohol consumption.
