Cancer care represents one of the most complex and resource-intensive areas of modern medicine, presenting significant economic challenges for patients, healthcare systems, and society as a whole. The current fee-for-service reimbursement structure provides an incentive to prescribe more chemotherapy and other expensive treatments even when the patient may not be likely to benefit from them, while the United States spends far more than other nations on health care, in proportion to its earnings as a nation. 

The economic burden of cancer care extends beyond direct medical costs to encompass broader societal implications, including lost productivity, caregiver burden, and the opportunity costs of healthcare resource allocation. Many patients lack access to affordable, high-quality cancer care. There are major disparities in cancer outcomes among individuals who are of lower socioeconomic status, are racial or ethnic minorities, and who are underinsured or lack health insurance coverage. Understanding these economic dimensions is crucial for medical and nursing professionals who will encounter patients struggling with financial barriers to optimal cancer care.
