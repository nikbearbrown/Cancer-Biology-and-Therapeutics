Health economics and access to cancer care represent critical challenges that require multifaceted approaches combining clinical excellence, economic efficiency, and ethical principles. As future healthcare professionals, understanding these complex interactions is essential for providing optimal patient care while advocating for systemic improvements.

The dramatic disparities in cancer outcomes between different populations and geographic regions underscore the urgent need for innovative solutions that address both immediate patient needs and long-term sustainability. Cancer has substantial economic impacts for patients, their families and/or caregivers, employers, and the health care system. However, there is only limited understanding of how economic issues can affect access to cancer care services and the receipt of high-quality cancer care. Success will require collaboration among clinicians, policymakers, patients, and communities to develop approaches that are clinically effective, economically viable, and ethically sound.

The evidence demonstrates that high-quality cancer care can be delivered cost-effectively when appropriate systems and incentives are in place. However, achieving this goal will require fundamental changes in how healthcare systems are organized, financed, and managed. Health care expenses in the United States are increasing inexorably. At the current rate of growth, it is anticipated that 20% of the gross national product will consist of health-related expenditures within the next decade. Although cancer is responsible for only 5% of the health care budget, its cost is increasing and it can be viewed as paradigmatic when contemplating the problem of equity in health care.

Value-based health care (VBHC) has recently emerged as a prominent movement within health care. Value-based health care focuses on maximizing outcomes achieved per dollar spent. As such, it bears many similarities to a well-established method, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), which provides a framework for evaluating the economic efficiency of healthcare interventions. As healthcare professionals, we have both an opportunity and an obligation to contribute to these improvements through our clinical practice, advocacy, and commitment to the principles of equity and justice in healthcare.
