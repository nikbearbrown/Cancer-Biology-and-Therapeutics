## The Burden of Cancer in Low- and Middle-Income Countries

Cancer has evolved from a disease primarily affecting wealthy nations to a global health challenge with disproportionate impacts on resource-limited settings. Treating a single cancer patient may require the coordination of many inputs and may cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in high-income countries (HICs), creating insurmountable barriers for most patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

The epidemiological transition in LMICs has shifted disease patterns toward non-communicable diseases, including cancer. Each year, 5 million people in low- and middle-income countries (LMCs) die from cancer, about 10 percent of the 50 million deaths in those countries. This represents a significant and growing burden that often exceeds the capacity of existing healthcare infrastructure.

Breakthroughs in our global fight against cancer have been achieved. However, this progress has been unequal. In low- and middle-income countries and for specific populations in high-income settings, many of these advancements are but an aspiration and hope for the future. The rising prevalence of noncommunicable diseases globally, with a strikingly disproportionate increase in prevalence and related mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), is a major threat to sustainable development. The epidemiologic trend of cancers in LMICs is of particular concern. Despite a lower incidence of cancer in LMICs compared with high-income countries, total cancer-related mortality is significantly higher in LMICs, especially in people younger than 65 years of age.

Cancer is rapidly becoming a major health care problem, especially in developing countries, where 60% of the world's total new cases are diagnosed. There is a projected rise in cancer cases worldwide, particularly in low-income countries where most cancer-related deaths are expected. Although the approval rate of cancer treatments has risen, their excessive cost and lack of affordability pose significant barriers to widespread access. Disparities in the costs of crucial cancer medications are influenced by geographic location.

## Healthcare Infrastructure Disparities

The availability of basic cancer care services varies dramatically between high-income and low-income countries. Less than 25% of the global population has access to basic, high-quality cancer surgery. Similarly, only 40–60% of patients with cancer are estimated to have access to radiotherapy services. These disparities in fundamental treatment modalities create profound inequities in survival outcomes.

Infrastructure limitations extend beyond specialized cancer services to encompass basic diagnostic capabilities. About 18 percent of low-income countries have recorded mortality data any time since 1950, and about 35 percent have published some population-based incidence data. This lack of basic epidemiological infrastructure hampers both clinical care and public health planning.

## Geographic and Economic Access Barriers

Geographic barriers compound economic constraints in resource-limited settings. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, and Madagascar, not having to pay for the costs of transportation reduced the proportion of patients not attending for surgery by 45%. This demonstrates how seemingly minor costs can create insurmountable barriers to essential cancer care.

The concentration of cancer services in urban centers creates additional disparities. LICs have a preponderance of Basic facilities, rural areas in MICs have more facilities with Limited capabilities, urban areas in MICs have more facilities with Enhanced capabilities, and much of the population in HICs has access to facilities with Maximal capabilities. This geographic maldistribution means that patients in rural areas face both distance and financial barriers to accessing appropriate care.

Palliative care and pain management constitute an integral part of the multi-disciplinary approach to treating patients with cancer. There are major disparities in the global presence of sustainable palliative care models and universal availability of effective pain medications, especially in low and middle income countries with the highest predicted future burden of cancer. Active intervention is needed to improve the availability of palliative care and effective pain control worldwide.

## Cancer Types and Stage Distribution

The types of cancers prevalent in different economic settings reflect varying risk factor exposures and screening capabilities. In high-income countries, breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers comprise more than 50 percent of diagnosed cancers. Middle-income countries—such as those in Latin America—have high rates of esophageal, stomach, and liver cancers. These differences reflect underlying risk factor patterns, including infectious disease burden and lifestyle factors.

Stage at diagnosis also varies significantly by resource setting. Delays in diagnosis, resulting from prolonged duration in the presentation, diagnosis, and/or treatment intervals, are often associated with education level, socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity, rural residence, and other risk factors. Later-stage diagnosis in resource-limited settings contributes to poorer outcomes and higher case fatality rates.

## Childhood Cancer Disparities

The disparities in cancer care are perhaps most stark for pediatric patients. Nonetheless, in the United States and other resource-rich countries, 75–80 percent of children with cancer survive for 5 years and most live out full lifetimes. But nearly 80 percent of the world's children who develop cancer are in resource-poor countries. Those without access to treatment, which is most in poor countries, do not survive.

This dramatic difference in outcomes reflects not only resource constraints but also the potential for effective intervention when appropriate care is available. For specific cancer types, such as childhood cancers, survival can be greater than 80% in high-resource settings and less than 20% in low-resource settings.

## Social Determinants and Vulnerable Populations

Indigenous populations face particular challenges in cancer care access globally. Despite this diversity, many Indigenous people around the world, in both high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries, continue to face substantial economic, health, and social disadvantages as a result of an enduring legacy of colonization, an ongoing marginalization and disempowerment.

These social determinants create compounding disadvantages. Indigenous people are more likely to have cancers that are largely preventable, detectable by screening, and/or have a poor prognosis, such as lung, liver, and cervical cancers. The intersection of social disadvantage, limited healthcare access, and higher-risk cancer types creates particularly challenging disparities.

## Screening and Prevention Disparities

Access to cancer screening varies dramatically by economic development level. A screening intervention can be successful only if the disease is more likely to be cured when detected early, and for which effective treatment for early-stage disease is available, affordable, and acceptable to the individual, the community, and the jurisdiction of interest.

The infrastructure requirements for effective screening programs often exceed the capacity of resource-limited settings. While these screening methods may be feasible in some settings (mainly middle-income countries), they can only be successful where a reasonable healthcare infrastructure exists and care for detected cancers can be accessed, a requirement that, unfortunately, still excludes many countries.
