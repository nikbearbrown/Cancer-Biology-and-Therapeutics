## The Economic Framework of Cancer Drug Pricing

Cancer drug pricing operates within a complex economic ecosystem that significantly impacts patient access to care. Oncology drugs comprise about one-third of all drugs given a fast track approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the quicker time to market via this regulatory pathway boosts the potential value of the drug. This accelerated pathway, while beneficial for bringing life-saving treatments to market quickly, contributes to the high cost structure of cancer therapeutics.

The pricing mechanisms for cancer drugs differ fundamentally from other pharmaceutical categories. In practice, many plans place cancer drugs on a third or fourth tier, and patients are expected to pay a percentage of the cost through coinsurance. This tiered system creates substantial financial barriers for patients, particularly those with advanced disease requiring multiple treatment lines.

## Financial Impact on Patients

The financial burden on individual patients can be devastating. For Revlimid, a cancer drug, a patient enrolled in Part D in 2016 faced total annual out-of-pocket costs of $11,538 for this drug alone in 2016, 76 percent of which was in the catastrophic coverage phase of the benefit. These costs have continued to escalate, with the price for Revlimid has since increased dramatically, to more than $18,000 per fill; thus, in the catastrophic phase under Part D, enrollees will pay more than $900 per month for this drug.

The concept of "financial toxicity" has emerged as healthcare professionals recognize that treatment costs can be as debilitating as the disease itself. Cancer treatment has become increasingly expensive, partially due to the use of specialty drugs. The costs of these drugs are often passed down to patients, who may face the consequences of paying for more than they can afford, leading to financial toxicity. Molecular and immune therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment and improved patient outcomes and survival. However, the pricing of these drugs has become an issue as the cost of cancer care continues to rise significantly. Cost sharing policies have increased out-of-pocket expenses for patients, leading to poorer financial well-being, quality of life, psychosocial health, and treatment adherence. People with cancer are at higher risk for bankruptcy than people without a cancer diagnosis. The financial cost of cancer treatment in the United States is astronomically high and is expected to rise. The economic burden of cancer care increasingly falls on the patients. Patients thus experience "financial toxicity" of cancer care that can have catastrophic consequences on health and quality of life.

Rising costs of cancer care drive patient financial toxicity (FT) that perpetuates known health disparities in access and quality cancer treatment. This financial stress not only affects immediate treatment decisions but can have long-term consequences for patients and their families, including delayed care, treatment abandonment, and reduced quality of life.

## Healthcare System Economics

From a healthcare system perspective, cancer care represents a significant portion of overall medical expenditures. Peter Eisenberg, an oncologist at Marin Specialty Care, noted that in his community practice, six doctors purchase about $8 million worth of chemotherapy each year, and sell it for about $10 million. The difference pays their salaries and practice expenses. This practice model creates inherent conflicts of interest where "Without selling chemotherapy, we wouldn't be in business," he said. "Doctors, like everybody else, respond to incentives."

The current reimbursement structure contributes to rising costs through several mechanisms. McClellan noted that as insurers have decreased their physician payments in order to cut costs, many oncologists' practice revenues have been driven by the profit margin made on the chemotherapies they administer to their patients. This creates a perverse incentive where more expensive treatments generate higher revenues for providers, regardless of their comparative effectiveness.

## International Pricing Comparisons

Global variation in pharmaceutical pricing policies reveals different approaches to managing drug costs. While most other developed nations have governmental mechanisms for negotiating or controlling prescription drug prices, either directly or de facto, there is no nationwide regulation of drug pricing in the United States. 

Countries like Australia have implemented comprehensive evaluation systems. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), an independent body appointed by the Australian government that decides which medicines are approved and which are not. When deciding whether to list a medicine on the PBS, the PBAC assesses the national disease burden, the medicine's clinical effectiveness, its safety, and cost-effectiveness compared with alternative treatments.

## Value-Based Pricing Approaches

The concept of value-based pricing has gained traction as a potential solution to rising drug costs. Chalkidou stressed that because of U.S. payers' willingness to pay the high prices of drugs, there is a disconnect between return on investment and value for money in the pharmaceutical industry. However, implementation faces significant regulatory barriers. Hartstein noted that CMS, which is the biggest payer for cancer care in this country, is prohibited from negotiating prices and interfering with the practice of medicine. In addition, the ACA specifically prohibits the use of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) or other metrics.

This paper examines the issue of prices, relative to value, for cancer drugs. Faced with largely price-insensitive consumers and payers, manufacturers would rationally charge high prices. Because U.S. payers do not require evidence on prices relative to value, U.S. data are unavailable to test whether prices are higher, relative to value, for cancer drugs than for other drugs. Evidence from the Canadian Common Drug Review on cost-utility values suggests that cancer drugs are relatively high priced, although conclusions are tentative because of very small samples and non-U.S. data. Making such outcomes-adjusted prices available in the U.S. would be helpful to physicians, payers, and patients and indirectly constrain pricing to align with value.

The monthly drug treatment costs in the USA were a median of 2·31 times (IQR 1·79-3·17) as high as in the assessed European countries. There were no significant associations between monthly treatment costs for solid tumours and clinical benefit in all assessed countries. Cancer drugs with low or uncertain clinical benefit might be prioritised for price negotiations. Value frameworks could help identify therapies providing high clinical benefit that should be made rapidly available across countries.

In this cross-sectional study, prices of brand-name medications for treatment of NSCLC increased in the US from 2015 to 2020 without evidence of price competition, raising concern about the affordability of promising oncology drugs. These findings suggest that drug pricing reform is needed.
