## Ethical Frameworks in Cancer Care Economics

The intersection of economics and ethics in cancer care raises fundamental questions about justice, equity, and the allocation of scarce resources. Dr. Daniel Brock of Harvard Medical School's Division of Medical Ethics began with his description of value in cancer care and treatment: "That the benefits in life extension and improved quality of life are obtained at a reasonable cost comparable to other typically-funded treatments and at a reasonable cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)".

However, the application of cost-effectiveness criteria to cancer care raises complex ethical questions. Many cancer drugs fail to meet this standard, which is in essence a cost-effectiveness standard. This creates tension between economic efficiency and other ethical principles such as beneficence and justice.

## Equity and Priority Setting

The question of who deserves priority in resource allocation becomes particularly acute in cancer care. Adhering to the adage that one can tell the justice of a society by how it treats its least well-off members, special concern or priority is often given to those who are worst off. Does this justify spending more on cancer patients who are near death?

This ethical dilemma becomes more complex when considering age and life expectancy. Assume for a moment, Dr. Brock said, that giving cancer drugs is equivalent to providing additional months or years of life. Who are the worst off with respect to months and years of life? Different ethical frameworks may lead to different conclusions about resource allocation priorities.

## Cost-Effectiveness and Moral Considerations

The role of cost-effectiveness analysis in healthcare decision-making extends beyond economic considerations to encompass moral obligations. Cost-effectiveness is not merely an economic concern, because improving people's health and well-being is a moral concern, and an allocation of resources that is not cost-effective produces fewer benefits than would have been possible with a different allocation.

However, the application of economic evaluation methods must account for values beyond efficiency. Producing more rather than fewer benefits for people is one important ethical consideration in evaluating actions and social policies, but it is not the only consideration. Issues of equity, dignity, and respect for persons must also be incorporated into policy decisions.

Many new cancer drugs provide only limited benefits, but at very great cost, for example, $200,000-$300,000 per quality-adjusted life year produced. By most standards of value or cost-effectiveness, this does not represent good value. The cost of cancer care has increased by five fold over the last three decades. As our healthcare system shifts from volume to value, greater scrutiny of interventions with clinical equipoise is required. Traditionally, QALYs and ICER have served as surrogate markers for value. However, this approach fails to incorporate all stakeholders' viewpoints.

The principle of extended dominance is applied in incremental cost-effectiveness analysis to eliminate from consideration strategies whose costs and benefits are improved by a mixed strategy of two other alternatives. Ethical considerations arise, however, in that equal care is not provided to all of the population. The implications of cost-effectiveness analysis are made explicit, revealing classic economic concerns about the tradeoff of equity and efficiency.

## Individual Responsibility and Health Outcomes

The question of individual responsibility for health outcomes introduces additional ethical complexity. There are strong moral reasons for considerable caution in letting health resource allocation depend on individuals' responsibility for their health needs. For that practice to be fair to those whose needs receive lower priority because of behavior, (a) the needs must have been caused by the behavior, (b) the behavior must have been voluntary, and (c) the persons must have known that the behavior would cause the health needs.

The example of smoking-related cancers illustrates these complexities. Smoking shows that these conditions are not easily satisfied. Smoking is one causal factor in much cancer and heart disease, but many smokers do not get those diseases, indicating that other factors, no doubt in part genetic differences for which individuals are not responsible, also play an important causal role.

## Professional Ethics and Financial Incentives

Healthcare professionals face ethical challenges when financial incentives conflict with patient care obligations. The realistic worry, concerning which the data are not yet in, is rather that over time the increased importance of investor-owned for-profit institutions may permit considerations of economic self-interest increasingly to invade the heretofore somewhat protected sphere of the physician/patient relationship.

The potential for conflicts of interest extends beyond individual practitioners to institutional and system-level considerations. In that light, it is unnecessary to view for-profit institutions as introducing a qualitatively new dimension of commercialization and new set of conflicts of interest into health care, as financial considerations have always played a role in healthcare delivery.

## Policy Approaches to Affordability

Various policy mechanisms have been proposed to address cancer care affordability while maintaining ethical standards. Emanuel further suggested that treatment guidelines be required to rank chemotherapy by price, and recommend the least expensive treatments be used first when outcomes are similar. Such approaches attempt to balance cost considerations with clinical effectiveness.

However, implementing cost-conscious policies requires careful attention to potential unintended consequences. Emanuel also suggested supporting insurers who only pay for cancer treatments that adhere to clinical practice guidelines, standard of care, or evidence-based treatment pathways. "We don't like to say no and be the bad guy, but we need to support insurers that say no," he said.

The burden of cancer on public finances is a serious concern for policy makers. More people are developing cancer, and as standards of care have risen, more are surviving and requiring longer-term care. Precision medicine promises better outcomes but demands commensurately higher payments for care. As both incidence and per case costs rise, the task of expanding access to high-quality cancer care poses a "value challenge" that policies in many countries are inadequate to meet. Policy makers should respond with a new approach using transparency and accountability as cornerstones of a new approach to promote value-based decision making.

The 340B drug pricing program is a health care policy that may provide an opportunity to mitigate the financial consequences of cancer care. The 340B program requires manufacturers to sell outpatient drugs at a discount to hospitals caring for a significant number of socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals. However, there has been growing discussion among stakeholders to reform the 340B program given the mixed findings of its effectiveness. With the rising costs of specialty drugs and associated prevalence of financial toxicity in patients with cancer, there is an opportunity to address these issues through reform that improves the program.

## Screening Ethics and Resource Allocation

Cancer screening programs raise particular ethical considerations regarding population-level interventions. Population-wide cancer screening programs increasingly raise controversies. Many members of the public and many health professionals believe strongly that early detection saves lives — that screening fulfills the clinical duty of beneficence.

However, screening also entails potential harms and opportunity costs. Recommendations to change the intensity of screening or the population invited to screen in order to limit the harms of screening — in order to fulfill the duty of non-maleficence — can be controversial. They may be seen as motivated by cost considerations even when they are based in a clinical analysis of harms and benefits.

## Global Justice and Health Equity

The dramatic disparities in cancer care between high-income and low-income countries raise questions of global justice. Feasible, affordable, and cost-effective interventions that reduce exposure to the key causes and other risk factors for cancer and for other noncommunicable diseases, increase access to essential health-care services, and ensure the availability of effective and affordable essential medicines and vaccines are crucial for disease control globally.

Addressing these disparities requires coordinated international action. RECOMMENDATION. Countries and global partners should follow the evolving information on newer screening approaches and determine the feasibility of adoption, given local resources and infrastructure. Such recommendations recognize both the potential benefits of cancer control interventions and the need to adapt approaches to local contexts.

## Future Directions and Sustainability

The long-term sustainability of cancer care systems requires innovative approaches that balance effectiveness, affordability, and equity. The committee's recommendations aim to ensure the delivery of high-quality cancer care across the care continuum, from diagnosis through end of life.

Achieving these goals will require fundamental changes in how cancer care is organized, financed, and delivered. The committee's vision for a cancer care delivery system is one in which all people with cancer have access to high-quality, affordable cancer care. Underpinning this system are new payment models that reward cancer care teams for providing patient-centered, high-quality care and eliminating wasteful interventions.
