Pediatric cancers represent a distinct category of malignancies that differ significantly from adult cancers in their biology, presentation, treatment approaches, and outcomes. While leukemias constitute the most common pediatric malignancies, solid tumors account for approximately 40% of childhood cancers. This chapter focuses on three major pediatric solid tumors: neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, and medulloblastoma. These embryonal tumors arise from developing tissues and demonstrate unique characteristics that reflect their origin from immature, rapidly dividing cells during organ development.
