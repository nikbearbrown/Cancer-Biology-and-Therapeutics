title: 34.1 Neuroblastoma

## Introduction and Epidemiology

Neuroblastoma is the most frequently occurring extracranial childhood tumor, classified as an embryonal neuroendocrine tumor originating from neural crest progenitor cells. It accounts for 8-10% of all pediatric neoplasms and approximately 15% of cancer deaths in pediatrics, with an incidence of 10.5 per million children under 15 years of age. Neuroblastoma constitutes the fourth most common malignant tumor in children and represents approximately 7% to 10% of childhood malignancy, making it the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood.

The disease demonstrates a striking age distribution, with 90% of cases diagnosed before age 6 and a median age at diagnosis of 22 months. Non-Hispanic White patients have a higher risk of developing neuroblastoma than all other race and ethnicity groups. There is a slight male predominance with a male-to-female ratio of 1.2:1.

## Pathophysiology and Molecular Biology

Neuroblastoma can occur anywhere along the sympathetic nervous system, including the superior cervical, paraspinal, and celiac ganglia; the majority arise in the adrenal glands. During embryogenesis, neuroblasts invaginate and migrate along the neuraxis, populating the adrenal medulla, sympathetic ganglia, the Meissner (submucosus) and Auerbach (myenteric) plexuses of the gastrointestinal tracts as well as other sites.

The tumor demonstrates remarkable biological heterogeneity, ranging from spontaneous regression to aggressive metastatic disease. Biologically, neuroblastomas can be divided into two major groups: one characterized by chromosomal multiplication and hyperdiploidy associated with good clinical prognosis, while gene amplification affecting N-myc characterizes a group of highly aggressive neoplasms with poor prognosis.

### Key Molecular Alterations

**MYCN Amplification**: Present in approximately 20-25% of neuroblastomas, MYCN amplification is strongly associated with advanced-stage disease and poor prognosis.

**Chromosomal Abnormalities**: 
- Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 1p36
- Deletions of 11q
- Gains of chromosome 17q

**Telomere Maintenance Mechanisms**: High-risk neuroblastoma tumors harbor aberrant genetic mechanisms for telomere lengthening, including chromosomal rearrangements involving the TERT gene at 5p15.33, which occur in approximately 20% to 25% of high-risk cases and are mutually exclusive with MYCN amplifications.

## Clinical Presentation

Due to high variability in presentation, clinical signs and symptoms can range from a benign palpable mass with distension to major illness from substantial tumor spread. The clinical manifestations depend largely on the primary tumor location and the presence of metastatic disease.

### Primary Tumor Effects
- **Abdominal mass**: Most common presentation when arising from adrenal glands
- **Horner syndrome**: When involving superior cervical ganglia (ptosis, miosis, anhydrosis)
- **Spinal cord compression**: When arising from paraspinal locations
- **Respiratory symptoms**: When arising from thoracic sympathetic chain

### Metastatic Disease
Over half of all neuroblastoma patients have hematogenous spread at diagnosis, with disease involving bone and bone marrow (56% and 71% respectively), followed by lymph nodes (31%), and lungs (3%).

### Paraneoplastic Syndromes
- **Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome**: Associated with better prognosis
- **Hypertension**: Due to catecholamine excess
- **Watery diarrhea**: Due to vasoactive intestinal peptide secretion

## Diagnosis and Staging

### Biochemical Markers
Since neuroblastoma cells produce catecholamines, breakdown products including homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) are elevated in urine in over 90% of cases.

### Histological Features
Histological confirmation requires identification of small round pale blue cells, known as Homer-Wright pseudorosettes. The International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (INPC) identifies four basic categories: neuroblastoma (Schwannian stroma-poor), ganglioneuroblastoma intermixed, ganglioneuroblastoma nodular, and ganglioneuroma.

### Risk Stratification
The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) developed a consensus approach using patient age, tumor stage, tumor grade and differentiation, histology, MYCN amplification, cytogenetic aberrations in 11q, and DNA ploidy, defining 16 pre-treatment groups broadly divisible into four prognostic subgroups based on five-year event-free survival:

- **Very low risk**: >85% five-year event-free survival
- **Low risk**: 75-85% five-year event-free survival  
- **Intermediate risk**: 50-75% five-year event-free survival
- **High risk**: &lt;50% five-year event-free survival

## Treatment Approaches

Treatment strategies are risk-stratified based on clinical and biological factors:

### Low and Intermediate Risk
- Surgery alone for localized, resectable tumors
- Observation for stage 4S disease with spontaneous regression potential
- Moderate-intensity chemotherapy for intermediate-risk disease

### High Risk
- Intensive multimodal therapy including:
  - Induction chemotherapy
  - Surgical resection
  - High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue
  - Radiation therapy
  - Immunotherapy with anti-GD2 antibodies
  - Maintenance therapy with retinoids

## Prognosis

Over 50% of newly diagnosed neuroblastomas are very low or low risk with excellent outcomes. However, high-risk disease continues to have poor outcomes despite intensive therapy. While relapsed neuroblastoma was previously believed to be universally fatal, there have been reports of salvage using radiation, chemotherapy, and/or combined chemo-immunotherapy, with many children now surviving for years on chronic active therapy with reasonable quality of life.
