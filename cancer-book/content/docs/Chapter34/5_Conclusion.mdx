Neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, and medulloblastoma represent three distinct pediatric embryonal tumors with unique biological characteristics, clinical presentations, and treatment approaches. Advances in molecular classification have revolutionized our understanding of these diseases, leading to risk-stratified treatment protocols that aim to optimize outcomes while minimizing long-term toxicities. Continued research into the molecular basis of these tumors holds promise for developing more targeted, less toxic therapeutic approaches that will improve both survival and quality of life for pediatric cancer survivors.
