title: 34.3 Medulloblastoma
---



## Introduction and Epidemiology  

While leukemias are the most common malignancy affecting the pediatric population, brain tumors are the most common solid tumors. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, constituting nearly 20% of all pediatric brain tumors. Embryonal tumors account for 20-25% of primary CNS tumors arising in children, with medulloblastomas comprising the vast majority of pediatric embryonal tumors.

Examining SEER database data from 1973-2007, the annual incidence was six per million children (approximately 450 new pediatric cases per year). Children aged 4-9 years had the highest incidence (44%), followed by adolescents 10-16 years (23%), and infants/toddlers 0-3 years (12%). Pediatric incidence is ten-fold higher than adult incidence, with males affected 1.5 times more than females.

## Pathophysiology and Molecular Biology

Medulloblastoma is thought to originate from granule cell precursors in the external germinal layer (EGL) of the developing cerebellum. Tumor growth starts in the fourth ventricle and can completely occupy it, then spreads to the cerebellar vermis and brainstem, seeding the craniospinal axis.

Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant tumor with propensity for local invasion and distant metastatic spread through the subarachnoid system ("drop mets"). Extraneural metastases occur in approximately 7% of pediatric cases, most commonly to bone (78%), lymph nodes (33%), liver (15%), and lungs (11%).

### Cytogenetic Alterations
The most common cytogenetic mutation is isochromosome 17q, resulting from loss of the short arm (17p) with gain of genetic material from the long arm (17q). Deletions in 17p leading to loss of heterozygosity are also frequently reported.

### Molecular Subgroups
Recent transcriptional profiling studies revealed four primary molecular subgroups with distinct transcriptomes, proteomes, and cytogenetic signatures: (1) SHH (sonic hedgehog), (2) WNT (wingless), (3) non-SHH/WNT group 3, and (4) non-SHH/WNT group 4.

**WNT Subgroup**:
- Excellent prognosis (>95% five-year survival)
- Often associated with classic histology
- Due to excellent outcomes, the WNT subgroup will be studied separately in future trials to evaluate therapy reduction while maintaining favorable outcomes

**SHH Subgroup**:
- Intermediate prognosis (70-88% five-year survival)
- Associated with desmoplastic/nodular histology in infants
- TP53 mutations confer worse prognosis

**Group 3 and Group 4**:
- Group 4 patients have 65-85% five-year survival, while Group 3 has 40-65% five-year survival, with MYC amplification portending the poorest outcomes

## Histopathological Classifications

The WHO recognizes five histological subtypes: classic (70%), desmoplastic-nodular (15%), large-cell anaplastic (10%), melanotic, and medullomyoblastoma (rare variants comprising 5%).

### Classic Medulloblastoma
Sheets of small round cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, high invasive tendency, and occasional neuroblastic differentiation.

### Desmoplastic-Nodular Variant  
Nodules of tumor cells displaying neurocytic differentiation on a collagen-rich matrix; less aggressive than classic variant.

### Large-Cell Anaplastic Variant
Large tumor cells with abundant cytoplasm, pleomorphic nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. Highly aggressive with high mitotic and apoptotic activity, large areas of necrosis, and especially poor prognosis.

## Clinical Presentation

Given origin in the cerebellum with propensity for spreading into the fourth ventricle, patients present with cerebellar signs including clumsiness, gait disturbances, and obstructive hydrocephalus symptoms such as early morning headaches, nausea/vomiting, double vision, or blurry vision.

### Signs and Symptoms
- **Increased intracranial pressure**: Morning headaches relieved during the day
- **Cerebellar dysfunction**: Ataxia, truncal unsteadiness, coordination problems
- **Brainstem involvement**: Cranial nerve palsies, diplopia, hearing loss, facial weakness
- **Hydrocephalus**: Due to fourth ventricular obstruction
- **Fundoscopic changes**: Papilledema or optic pallor

Time from symptom onset to diagnosis is usually short, typically 2-3 months.

## Diagnosis and Staging

### Imaging Studies
- **MRI**: Preferred for anatomical detail and detecting residual disease
- **Spinal MRI**: Essential for detecting metastatic spinal lesions  
- **CT**: May reveal fourth ventricular mass with contrast enhancement

### CSF Analysis
Lumbar puncture may reveal leptomeningeal tumor spread, though CSF may be normal despite positive MRI. Following surgery, lumbar puncture is delayed at least 2 weeks to avoid false-positive results from surgical dissemination.

### Risk Stratification
Traditional classification divides patients into average-risk and high-risk based on:
- Age (â‰¥3 years for average risk)
- Extent of residual disease (&lt;1.5 cm for average risk)
- Presence of metastases (absent for average risk)

## Treatment Approaches

Current treatment combines surgical resection with chemotherapy and radiation, with cure rates in average-risk patients reaching 75%. However, treatment-related neurologic, cognitive, and endocrinologic sequelae affect up to 80% of survivors.

### Surgical Management
- Maximal safe resection to relieve CSF obstruction
- Care must be taken as tumors are friable and can disseminate quickly. More than 40% of patients have residual neurological deficits post-surgery
- Ventriculoperitoneal shunt often necessary for hydrocephalus

### Radiation Therapy
- Craniospinal radiation for local control and micrometastatic disease
- Should be administered within 4 weeks after surgery to maximize response
- Dose reduction associated with higher relapse rates

### Targeted Therapies
Based on molecular subgroups:

**SHH Subgroup**: 
SMO inhibitors including vismodegib and sonidegib are in clinical trials for relapsed SHH medulloblastoma

**WNT Subgroup**: 
Given excellent prognosis (>90% five-year survival), current efforts focus on limiting cytotoxic therapies such as reducing radiation doses

## Prognosis and Long-term Outcomes

Five-year survival rates range from 50-90% depending on multiple factors including age, presence of metastases, molecular subgroup, and extent of residual disease. The highest survival rates are seen in WNT subgroup (97-100%), while Group 3 medulloblastoma has the worst outcomes (40-65%).

### Long-term Complications
Treatment-related sequelae include:
- Neurological and cognitive deficits  
- Growth hormone deficiency
- Learning difficulties
- Gonadotropin and thyroid hormone deficiencies
- Secondary malignancies
- Ototoxicity from chemotherapy

Even after successful treatment, many patients have permanent residual neurological and cognitive deficits, with complete functional recovery taking months to years.
