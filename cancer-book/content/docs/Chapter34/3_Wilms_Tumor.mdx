title: 34.2 Wilms Tumor
---



## Introduction and Epidemiology

Wilms tumor, or nephroblastoma, is the most common renal cancer in the pediatric age group, the most common pediatric abdominal cancer, and the fourth most common pediatric cancer overall. There are approximately 650 new cases in the United States every year, with most tumors (75%) occurring in children less than 5 years of age. The tumor was first described by German physician Dr. Max Wilms in 1899.

The median age of diagnosis is 3.5 years, with 90% of cases diagnosed before age 6. Girls are slightly more likely to develop Wilms tumor than boys. There are notable racial differences, with higher incidence in Africans and African Americans, while East Asians have the lowest incidence and better survival outcomes.

## Molecular Biology and Genetics

The cause of Wilms tumor is believed to be due to genetic alterations affecting normal embryological development of the genitourinary tract. Several key genes have been implicated in Wilms tumorigenesis:

### Major Genetic Alterations
- **WT1 gene**: Located at 11p13, involved in genitourinary development
- **CTNNB1**: Encodes β-catenin, involved in Wnt signaling
- **WTX gene**: X-linked tumor suppressor
- **TP53**: Associated with anaplastic histology and poor prognosis
- **MYNC**: Contributes to unfavorable outcomes

Genetic markers including WT1, CTNNB1, and WTX gene alterations are found in about one-third of all Wilms tumors, while poorer prognosis is linked to TP53 mutations and loss of heterozygosity at chromosomes 1p, 1q, 11p15, and 16q.

### Developmental Origin
Wilms tumor is thought to develop from persistent metanephric tissue or nephrogenic rests, which may occur in 1% of infantile kidneys but typically regress during childhood. These abnormal metanephric cells are found in up to 100% of cases of bilateral Wilms but only 35% of unilateral tumors.

## Associated Syndromes

Several genetic syndromes predispose to Wilms tumor development:

### WAGR Syndrome
WAGR syndrome includes Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation. Children with WAGR syndrome have a 50% chance of developing Wilms tumor and have chromosomal abnormalities in the WT1 gene.

### Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome
Clinically diagnosed by hemihypertrophy, pancreatic enlargement, hypertrophic kidneys, omphalocele, ear creases, macrosomia, and macroglossia. Affected patients have a 5-10% chance of developing Wilms tumor.

### Denys-Drash Syndrome
Includes male pseudo-hermaphroditism and progressive renal failure starting in infancy, with 90% of affected individuals eventually developing Wilms tumor.

## Histopathology

The histological features of Wilms tumor closely recapitulate those of the developing kidney, with both composed of three elements: blastema (primitive metanephric tissue), epithelium (primitive and mature tubular structures), and stroma (primitive mesenchymal and mature stromal elements including muscle, cartilage, bone, fat, and other tissues).

### Favorable vs. Unfavorable Histology

**Favorable Histology** (90% of cases):
Classical histological features include a triphasic pattern of blastema, epithelial, and stromal tissues. The blastema consists of small, round blue cells with active mitotic activity. The epithelial component shows wide variations from early tubular formation to differentiating glomeruli-like structures.

**Unfavorable Histology** (10% of cases):
Characterized by anaplasia, defined as hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei that are three times larger than adjacent cells with abnormal mitotic figures. Anaplasia is associated with poor response to treatment.

## Clinical Presentation

Wilms tumor usually presents as an asymptomatic abdominal mass in the majority of children, often discovered by caregivers during bathing. Additional presenting features include:

- **Abdominal pain**: Most common initial symptom (30-40%)
- **Hypertension**: Present in 25% of patients, normalizes after nephrectomy  
- **Hematuria**: Occurs in 12-25% of cases
- **Associated anomalies**: Cryptorchidism, varicocele, hypospadias in boys; congenital uterine anomalies in 10% of girls

## Staging and Risk Assessment

### Staging System
- **Stage I**: Tumor completely contained within kidney (40-45%)
- **Stage II**: Tumor extends outside kidney but completely resectable (20%)
- **Stage III**: Incomplete surgical removal or peritoneal contamination (20-25%)
- **Stage IV**: Distant metastases (10%)
- **Stage V**: Bilateral kidney involvement (5%)

### Prognostic Factors
The prognosis varies by tumor stage and histology, with favorable histology showing survival rates of 99% to 86%, while unfavorable histology ranges from 84% to 38% depending on stage. Poor prognostic factors include:

- Anaplastic histology
- Loss of heterozygosity at chromosomes 1p, 16q
- Higher stage disease
- Age older than 2 years
- Large tumor size

## Treatment

Treatment usually involves nephrectomy followed by systemic chemotherapy, though some protocols initiate chemotherapy first. Combination chemotherapy typically includes vincristine and dactinomycin, with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carboplatin used for more aggressive disease.

### Surgical Considerations
- Complete tumor removal when possible
- Lymph node sampling for staging
- Routine biopsies are not recommended as they automatically increase tumor staging to Stage III, requiring radiation and chemotherapy
- For bilateral disease, nephron-sparing surgery is attempted

### Radiation Therapy
For patients without metastases receiving radiation, initiation within 14 days of surgery appears to improve overall survival.

## Differential Diagnosis

Differential diagnosis includes clear cell renal sarcoma (second most common childhood renal tumor with worse prognosis), rhabdoid renal tumors (highly malignant with 80% mortality within one year), congenital mesoblastic nephroma (typically in first year of life), and renal cell carcinoma.

Recent MRI diffusion studies suggest that apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values may help differentiate Wilms tumor from neuroblastoma, with a cutoff ADC value ≥0.645 × 10⁻³ mm²/sec suggesting Wilms tumor.

## Long-term Outcomes and Complications

Present-day survival rates are 80-90%, with the addition of radiation therapy significantly improving outcomes. However, there are long-term complications including increased risk of secondary malignancies, particularly breast cancer in females who received chest radiation.
