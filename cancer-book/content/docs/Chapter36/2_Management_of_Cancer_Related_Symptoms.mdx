## Cancer Pain Management

Pain is one of the most common symptoms in cancer patients and often has a negative impact on patients' functional status and quality of life (QOL). The goal of pain management is to provide evidence-based, comprehensive care that addresses both physical pain and the emotional, social, and spiritual aspects of suffering.

### WHO Analgesic Ladder

In 1986, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed the WHO analgesic ladder to provide adequate pain relief for cancer patients. The analgesic ladder was part of a vast health program termed the WHO Cancer Pain and Palliative Care Program, aimed at improving strategies for cancer pain management through educational campaigns, creating shared strategies, and developing a global network of support.

The three main principles of the WHO analgesic ladder are: "By the clock, by the mouth, by the ladder." This means that drugs should be taken regularly and at regular intervals, orally whenever possible, and analgesics should be prescribed starting at Step 1 (nonopioid analgesics) and titrated upward as needed.

**Step 1: Non-opioid analgesics**
- Acetaminophen
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketorolac)
- Adjuvant medications

**Step 2: Weak opioids**
- Codeine
- Tramadol
- Low-dose morphine

**Step 3: Strong opioids**
- Morphine
- Oxycodone
- Fentanyl
- Methadone

### Opioid Management

Strong opioids, especially morphine, are the principal treatments for pain related to advanced and progressive disease, and their use has increased significantly in the primary care setting. However, the pharmacokinetics of the various opioids are very different and there are marked differences in bioavailability, metabolism and response among patients.

A suitable opioid must be selected for each patient and, because drug doses cannot be estimated or calculated in advance, the dose must be individually titrated. Effective and safe titration of opioids has a major impact on patient comfort.

**Methadone Considerations**
Given the complexities related to methadone administration, it is important that this opioid be prescribed by experienced clinicians who can provide careful monitoring. Methadone is both a mu-receptor agonist and an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. It can be given via multiple routes (oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, and rectal); has a long half-life (13 to 58 hours) and rapid onset of action; and is inexpensive, making it an attractive option for cancer pain control.

### Pain Assessment and Monitoring

The clinical assessment of pain in medically ill patients is complex. Effective pain management requires close monitoring of patient response to initiation of treatment. In a review of 1,612 patients referred to an outpatient palliative care center where patients with advanced cancer were seen by both a palliative care nurse and a physician, more than half of patients with moderate to severe pain did not respond to an initial palliative care consultation.

### Cultural Considerations in Pain Management

In a cross-sectional study, the cancer pain experience of White patients was individual and independent, while that of racial and ethnic minority patients was family oriented. Minority patients received support from their families during cancer treatment, and they fought cancer for their families. Other studies indicate that Asian patients have greater barriers to pain management and display more fatalism than Western patients.

### Total Pain Concept

Saunders conceptualized the concept of "total pain" in evaluating and managing pain in the dying. The concept of total pain encompasses 4 components: the physical noxious stimuli, emotional discomfort, interpersonal conflicts, and the nonacceptance of one's death.

## Nausea and Vomiting Management

Prevention and control of nausea and vomiting (N&V) are paramount in the treatment of patients with cancer. Chemotherapy-induced N&V is one of the most common and distressing acute side effects of cancer treatment. It occurs in up to 80% of patients and can have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life.

### Classification of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting

**Acute N&V**: Nausea and/or vomiting that occurs within 24 hours of chemotherapy administration.

**Delayed N&V**: Nausea and/or vomiting that occurs more than 24 hours after chemotherapy administration and may persist for several days.

**Anticipatory N&V (ANV)**: ANV is nausea and/or vomiting that occurs before a new cycle of chemotherapy is begun, in response to conditioned stimuli such as the smells, sights, and sounds of the treatment room. ANV is a classically conditioned response that typically occurs after three or four chemotherapy treatments after which the patient experienced acute or delayed N&V.

**Breakthrough N&V**: Vomiting that occurs within 5 days of prophylactic use of antiemetics and requires rescue.

**Refractory N&V**: N&V that does not respond to treatment.

### Antiemetic Medications

**5-HT3 Receptor Antagonists**
Selective serotonin receptor (5-HT3) antagonists block serotonin, specifically targeting gastrointestinal (GI) vagal nerve terminals and the chemoreceptor trigger zone within the central nervous system:
- Ondansetron (Zofran)
- Granisetron (Kytril)
- Dolasetron (Anzemet)
- Palonosetron (Aloxi)

**NK-1 Receptor Antagonists**
Drugs that block the NK-1 receptor, a protein in the brain that can trigger nausea and vomiting:
- Aprepitant (Emend)
- Fosaprepitant

**Dopamine Receptor Antagonists**
Drugs that block dopamine, a chemical in the brain that can trigger nausea and vomiting:
- Metoclopramide (Reglan)
- Prochlorperazine (Compazine)
- Chlorpromazine

**Corticosteroids**
- Dexamethasone (Decadron)
- Methylprednisolone (Medrol)

### Dexamethasone in Antiemetic Therapy

Dexamethasone alone or in combination with ondansetron has proven efficacy for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy. Studies have shown that following antiemetic protocols that include dexamethasone can improve patient outcomes and reduce the need for rescue medications.

### Non-Pharmacological Approaches

**Acupressure**: Practitioners working with patients undergoing chemotherapy regularly encourage them to use acupressure in the form of Sea Bands for the relief of treatment-related nausea and vomiting. Results suggest that acupressure may decrease nausea among patients undergoing chemotherapy.

## Cancer-Related Fatigue

Cancer-related fatigue is one of the most prevalent and distressing symptoms experienced by cancer patients. Unlike normal fatigue, cancer-related fatigue is not relieved by rest and can significantly impact quality of life and functional status.

### Pathophysiology

Cancer-related fatigue may result from:
- Direct effects of the tumor
- Cancer treatments (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery)
- Anemia
- Nutritional deficiencies
- Sleep disturbances
- Depression and anxiety
- Metabolic disorders
- Medications

### Assessment and Management

Assessment should include evaluation of:
- Intensity and pattern of fatigue
- Impact on daily activities
- Contributing factors
- Associated symptoms

Management strategies include:
- Treatment of underlying causes (anemia, depression, sleep disorders)
- Exercise therapy (as appropriate)
- Energy conservation techniques
- Psychosocial interventions
- Pharmacological interventions when indicated
