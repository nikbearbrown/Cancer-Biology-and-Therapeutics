## Psychosocial Needs of Cancer Patients

Cancer patients and their families face significant psychological and social challenges throughout the cancer journey. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) defines distress as an unpleasant experience of psychological, social, spiritual, and/or physical nature that may hinder the ability of patients to cope effectively with cancer or its treatment.

### Prevalence and Impact

Distress is prevalent in approximately one-third of cancer survivors and can be associated with a reduced quality of life. Furthermore, patients experiencing distress have a lower likelihood of adhering to recommended health behaviors and surveillance strategies. Mood disorders, including anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder, are common manifestations of distress.

## Assessment of Psychological Distress

### Screening Tools

The NCCN distress thermometer along with other tools such as PHQ9 can be easily administered prior to clinic visit such that the clinician and appropriate support staff (e.g., social worker or financial navigator) can be notified. Patients who display signs of anxiety, depression, or distress on initial screening should be thoroughly evaluated by the oncologist regarding any physical cause related to cancer or anticancer therapy.

### Safety Evaluation

Safety evaluation, such as suicidal intent, safety at home, and social isolation, should be conducted by appropriate personnel. Access to licensed social workers experienced in caring for cancer patients or a dedicated psycho-oncologist is desirable for initial evaluation prior to referring selected patients to psychiatry.

## Special Populations

### Older Adults
Although "health and well-being, social circumstances, living arrangements, and age-related changes resulting in diminished psychologic and physical functioning vary by individual and not by chronological age," older adults with cancer are more likely to present with a preexisting chronic disease and increased functional impairment and disability, which can compound the stresses imposed by cancer.

### Children and Adolescents
The great cognitive, emotional, and developmental (as well as physical) variations among children affect the extent to which they can fully understand the implications of their disease and be involved in treatment decision making, how they cope with the physical pain and discomfort of treatment, and their need for psychosocial services.
