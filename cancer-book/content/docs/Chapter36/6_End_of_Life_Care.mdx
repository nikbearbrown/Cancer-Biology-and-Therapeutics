title: 36.5 End-of-Life Care
---



## Defining End-of-Life Care

For most people, death does not come suddenly. Instead, dying is an inevitable result of one or more diseases that must be managed carefully and compassionately over weeks, months, or even years, through many ups and downs. Evidence shows that—regardless of whether curative treatments are also undertaken—a palliative approach often offers the best chance of maintaining the highest possible quality of life for the longest possible time for those living with advanced serious illness.

## Hospice Care

### Definition and Philosophy

The underlying premise behind hospice care is to focus on the quality of care to patients who present with a life-limiting illness who are not expected to live more than six months instead of seeking treatment to prolong the condition or seek a medical cure. Hospice focuses on the entire person and supports the family by combining all elements of physical, psychological, and spiritual needs.

### Eligibility Criteria

For Medicare hospice benefits, patients must meet the following criteria:
- Over 65 years of age or eligible for Medicare services due to long-term disability for greater than two years or having end-stage kidney disease
- Certification by Medicare as a recognized hospice facility
- Patient verification choosing hospice services instead of utilizing regular Medicare coverage
- Certification from both a physician and hospice medical director verifying the patient has received a diagnosis of a terminal illness, and in typical circumstances, without treatment to prolong the patient's disease, they are expected not to live more than six months

### Hospice Services

When a patient has a terminal condition, Medicare will provide hospice care, including comprehensive services related to a terminal illness. The array of benefits may include:
- Physician and nursing services
- Medical equipment and supplies
- Medications for symptom control
- Physical, occupational, and speech therapy
- Social worker services
- Spiritual care
- Short-term respite care
- Bereavement support for families

## Signs and Symptoms in the Final Days

Healthcare providers can give family members information about the changes they may see in their loved one in the final hours and how they may help their loved one through this. Common signs and symptoms include:

### Physical Changes
- Feeling very tired
- Shortness of breath
- Constipation
- Trouble swallowing
- Rattle sound with breathing
- Myoclonic jerks
- Hemorrhage

### Neurological Changes
- Delirium is common during the final days of life
- Most patients have a lower level of consciousness
- They may be withdrawn, be less alert, and have less energy
- Some patients may be agitated or restless, and have hallucinations

## Family Support and Bereavement

### Supporting Families

Families need information and support during the end-of-life period:
- Education about what to expect
- Emotional support and counseling
- Practical assistance with care
- Respite care services
- Spiritual support

### Bereavement Support

Support for caregivers continues after the patient's death:
- Grief counseling
- Support groups
- Memorial services
- Follow-up contact and assessment
- Referral to community resources

## Barriers to End-of-Life Care

In 2017 Hospice UK estimated that one in four people, approximately 118,000, who require end-of-life care and their families are not able to access the expert care they need at the end of life. This is particularly true for people with conditions other than cancer, and people from economically and socially deprived areas, BAME communities and LGBT people can experience barriers to accessing end-of-life care services.

### Common Barriers
- Poor communication and coordination of services
- Professionals' difficulty recognizing when someone has entered the last year of life
- Lack of skills to discuss end-of-life issues with openness and sensitivity
- Limited availability of services
- Cultural and language barriers
- Financial constraints

## Spiritual Care at End of Life

Serious illnesses like cancer may cause patients or family caregivers to have doubts about their beliefs or religious values and cause spiritual distress. Some studies show that patients with cancer may feel anger at God or may have a loss of faith after being diagnosed.

Spiritual distress may affect end-of-life decisions and increase depression. Doctors and nurses, together with social workers and psychologists, may be able to offer care that supports a patient's spiritual health. When patients with advanced cancer receive spiritual support from the medical team, they are more likely to choose hospice care and less aggressive treatment at the end of life.

## Advance Care Planning

Advance care planning involves discussions about:
- Values and goals for end-of-life care
- Preferences for life-sustaining treatments
- Designation of healthcare proxies
- Completion of advance directives
- Documentation of care preferences

## Quality of Death

In their efforts to define the concept of a "Good Death," researchers narrowed it down to 36 studies that addressed the parameters for good death defined by patients at the end of their life. Pain-free status was 1 of the top 3 priorities noted, with 81% of the studies significantly weighing on its importance.

Elements of a good death include:
- Adequate pain and symptom management
- Clear decision-making
- Preparation and closure
- Affirmation of the whole person
- Strengthening relationships
- Coming to terms with reality
- Receiving adequate medical care
- Being treated with dignity and respect
