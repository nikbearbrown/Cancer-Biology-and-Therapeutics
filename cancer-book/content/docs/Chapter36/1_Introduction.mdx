Supportive care and palliative care are essential components of comprehensive cancer management that focus on optimizing quality of life and alleviating suffering throughout the entire disease trajectory. These approaches address the physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs of patients and their families, from diagnosis through survivorship or end-of-life care. This chapter examines the fundamental principles of supportive care, management of common cancer-related symptoms, nutritional considerations, psychological support, palliative care principles, and end-of-life care.
