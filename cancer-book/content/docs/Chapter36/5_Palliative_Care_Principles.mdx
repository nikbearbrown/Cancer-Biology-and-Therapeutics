title: 36.4 Palliative Care Principles
---



## Definition and Goals

The World Health Organization characterizes the field of palliative care as a form of specialized medical care that aims to optimize the quality of life and alleviate the suffering of patients. One of the primary ways to achieve this is through early identification and treatment of new symptoms, along with managing those that prove refractory.

Palliative care addresses the physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs of patients with a serious illness, including but not limited to those with a life-limiting diagnosis, by employing an interprofessional team approach.

## Core Principles

Palliative care is characterized by the following features:
- It provides relief from pain and other distressing symptoms
- It affirms life and regards dying as a normal process
- It is intended neither to hasten nor to postpone death
- It integrates the physical, psychological and spiritual aspects of care
- It gives the patient and her family as much control and decision-making power as they desire and are able to accept
- It offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death

## Palliative Care vs. Hospice Care

Palliative care is often confused with hospice care. Palliative care is a larger umbrella that encompasses hospice care but is not limited to it. Palliative care works to enhance the quality of life and limit suffering in patients regardless of their goals of treatment, including working with patients seeking curative treatment.

Key differences:
- **Palliative Care**: Can be provided alongside curative treatment at any stage of serious illness
- **Hospice Care**: Focuses on comfort care for patients with a prognosis of 6 months or less who have chosen to forgo curative treatments

## Interdisciplinary Team Approach

A palliative team is comprised of a wide array of professionals, including:
- Palliative care physicians
- Specialty-trained nurses
- Social workers
- Chaplains
- Pharmacists
- Rehabilitation therapists
- Dietitians

## Symptom Management

Palliative care providers are adept at using a variety of pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical therapies to alleviate symptoms. These symptoms include pain, dyspnea, nausea, anxiety, depression, and fatigue.

Often anticipating and preventing symptoms before they occur is more effective than treating them after they occur. For example, prescribing the appropriate bowel regimen for patients at risk of developing constipation.

## Communication in Palliative Care

Palliative care providers are also communication specialists. Key communication strategies include:
- Breaking bad news sensitively
- Discussing prognosis and goals of care
- Facilitating family conferences
- Supporting decision-making
- Planning transitions in care

### Breaking Bad News

When delivering difficult news:
- Prepare the setting and ensure privacy
- Assess what the patient/family already knows
- Ask permission before sharing information
- Provide information clearly and compassionately
- Respond to emotions with empathy
- Set up a clear plan for communication and follow-up
- Avoid statements that imply abandonment

## Early Integration of Palliative Care

Early utilization of palliative care has been correlated with improved survival in patients with metastatic cancer, reduced cost of care, and improved quality of life. Studies have shown that using palliative care teams can decrease overall healthcare costs, including improved intensive care unit utilization, decreased emergency department utilization, and reduced inpatient readmission rates.
