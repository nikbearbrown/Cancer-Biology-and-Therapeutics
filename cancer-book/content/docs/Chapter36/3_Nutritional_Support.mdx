title: 36.2 Nutritional Support

## Cancer-Associated Malnutrition

Malnutrition is a common problem in cancer patients that has been recognized as an important component of adverse outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality and decreased quality of life. Nutritional status can be compromised in direct response to tumor-induced alterations in metabolism.

### Cancer Cachexia

Cancer cachexia is a wasting syndrome that leads to weakness, fatigue, and loss of skeletal muscle (also called sarcopenia) and fat. Unlike malnutrition, it cannot be reversed with nutrition support alone. Tumor-induced weight loss occurs frequently in patients with solid tumors of the lung, pancreas, and upper gastrointestinal tract and less often in patients with breast cancer or lower gastrointestinal cancer.

### Assessment of Nutritional Status

Malnutrition and cachexia may be assessed simply in office practice by:
1. Measurement of weight loss as a percentage of the patient's usual body weight, accounting for edema, if any
2. Current weight as it compares to ideal body weight
3. A history of decreased appetite and/or decreased food intake

Anthropometric studies (weight, weight/height ratio, calf circumference, and mid-arm circumference) can be useful when performed serially by the same professional to assess the impact of nutritional intervention.

### Nutritional Screening Tools

The simplified method called malnutrition screening test (MST), which is based on only two parameters, appetite and recent unintentional weight loss, is useful in the assessments of malnutrition in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.

## Treatment-Related Nutritional Issues

The most commonly experienced nutrition-related side effects are anorexia, taste changes, early satiety, nausea, vomiting, mucositis/esophagitis, diarrhea, and constipation. Because side effects of chemotherapy, as well as the cancer itself, can greatly affect nutritional status, healthcare providers need to anticipate possible problems and educate the patient about them in an effort to prevent malnutrition and weight loss.

### Management Strategies

**Dietary Modifications**
- Small, frequent meals
- High-calorie, high-protein foods
- Foods that are easy to swallow and digest
- Attention to food preferences and cultural considerations

**Nutritional Supplements**
Nutritional support or high-calorie/high-protein liquid supplements may be used in an effort to maintain adequate calorie and nutrient intake. Examples include:
- Ensure
- Boost
- Specialized cancer nutrition products

**Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition**
For patients who continue to struggle to eat and keep up their weight, other nutrition support options may be discussed:
- Tube feeding (enteral nutrition) for patients with functional GI tract
- IV nutrition (parenteral nutrition) when the GI tract must be bypassed

## Nutrition in Advanced Cancer

Patients with advanced cancer can receive nutritional support even when nutrition therapy can do little for weight gain. Such support may help accomplish the following:
- Lessen side effects
- Reduce risk of infection (if given enterally)  
- Reduce asthenia
- Improve well-being

In individuals with advanced cancer, the goal of nutrition therapy should not be weight gain or reversal of malnutrition, but rather comfort and symptom relief.
