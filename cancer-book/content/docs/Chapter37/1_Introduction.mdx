Cancer survivorship represents one of the most significant healthcare achievements of the 21st century, with the number of cancer survivors continuing to increase worldwide due to improvements in early detection, treatment advances, and an aging population. More than 16.9 million Americans (8.1 million males and 8.8 million females) with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2019; this number is projected to reach more than 22.1 million by January 1, 2030 based on the growth and aging of the population alone. Globally, there are currently 33 million cancer survivors worldwide. With improvements in early cancer detection and treatments, patients are living longer - and it is well-recognized that many survivors develop short- and long-term physical, psychosocial and spiritual effects as a result of their diagnoses and treatments.

The Institute of Medicine's landmark 2006 report "From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition" fundamentally changed how healthcare providers and policymakers view cancer survivorship, recognizing that survivors face significant risks for physical, psychosocial, and financial consequences from cancer and its treatment. This growing recognition has led to the development of survivorship as a distinct phase of the cancer care continuum.

The definition of survivorship itself remains complex and multifaceted. As defined by the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship (NCCS), survivorship begins at the time of diagnosis and continues throughout the life of a person with cancer. This broad definition acknowledges that the challenges and needs of cancer survivors begin immediately upon diagnosis and evolve throughout their cancer journey.
