title: Psychosocial Challenges for Survivors
---


The psychological and social impact of cancer extends well beyond the completion of treatment, creating complex challenges that can persist for years or even decades. People with cancer face the risk of substantial and permanent physical impairment, disability, and inability to perform routine activities of daily living, as well as the psychological and social problems that can result from the diagnosis and its sequelae.

## Mental Health Complications

Cancer survivors experience significantly higher rates of mental health issues compared to the general population. The prevalence of depression and anxiety among cancer patients is significantly greater than that seen in the general population. Research demonstrates that cancer patients who are most at risk of psychological and/or behavioral difficulties include those with a prior history of anxiety or mood disorders; men; the aged (risk rises at age 55 and older); those who are alone, either actually or functionally; individuals who are unemployed or are of low socioeconomic status; patients receiving the most toxic therapies; and individuals with progressive disease or recurrence.

The impact of untreated mental health issues extends beyond psychological well-being. A meta-analysis of 50 studies showed a significantly heightened risk (hazard ratio of 1.34) for premature mortality among patients with breast, lung, stomach, or colorectal cancer who were also diagnosed with depression.

## Psychosocial Effects in Childhood Cancer Survivors

Adult survivors of childhood cancer face particularly complex psychosocial challenges. Adult survivors are twice as likely as sibling controls to report significant psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety and depression. They are almost twice as likely to report suicide ideation and impaired mental health, and they are nearly four times more likely to be diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms compared with their siblings.

The social and functional impacts are equally significant. Compared with siblings, adult survivors of childhood cancers are approximately five times more likely to report functional impairment in health-related quality of life; about three times more likely to report using special education services; less likely to attend college; six times more likely to report unemployment related to health; and more likely to be unmarried.

## Long-term Appraisal and Coping

The way cancer survivors perceive their experience evolves over time. Cancer survivorship is best viewed as a process that continues across the life span. Appraisals of cancer change over time and may not be explicit until long after treatment completion. Understanding these changing perceptions is crucial for providing appropriate support throughout the survivorship journey.

## Evidence-Based Psychosocial Interventions

Research has identified several effective interventions for addressing psychosocial challenges in cancer survivors. Effective psychosocial interventions that reduce emotional distress and improve quality of life in high-risk patients typically include some sort of stress reduction strategy (e.g., relaxation training), information, behavioral and cognitive coping strategies (e.g., dealing with fatigue), social support, and focused interventions.

Meta-analyses have demonstrated positive outcomes with various approaches. Positive outcomes were found with psycho-education, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation, and mindfulness-based stress reduction. Six meta-analyses found moderate to very large effect sizes, particularly for depression.
