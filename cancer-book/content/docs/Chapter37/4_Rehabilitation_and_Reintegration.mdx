title: Rehabilitation and Reintegration

Rehabilitation plays a crucial role in optimizing functional outcomes and quality of life for cancer survivors. Cancer rehabilitation can be broadly defined as the maximum restoration of physical, psychologic, social, vocational, recreational, and economic functions within the limits imposed by the malignancy and its treatment.

## Physical Rehabilitation

The need for rehabilitation services among cancer survivors is substantial yet often unmet. In one study, 163 women with metastatic breast cancer reported a total of 530 physical impairments that were not detected during hospitalization, but which required physical therapy and/or occupational therapy. In another study of 529 older adults with cancer, 341 (approximately 64 percent) had potentially modifiable functional deficits and needed physical or occupational therapy, but only 9 percent of the patients with these impairments received such therapy.

### Systematic Evidence for Rehabilitation

A systematic review of prospective, controlled trials investigating rehabilitative interventions for cancer survivors found evidence supporting the efficacy of rehabilitative interventions for individuals with a cancer history across a range of functional domains. These findings provide strong evidence for integrating rehabilitation services into standard survivorship care.

Studies published so far report statistically significant benefits for multidimensional interventions over usual care, most notably for the outcomes fatigue, quality of life, and physical functioning. However, multidimensional rehabilitation programs were found to be effective, but not more effective than monodimensional interventions, and not on all outcome measures.

### Exercise and Physical Activity

Exercise interventions have demonstrated particular promise in cancer rehabilitation. Existing interventions are effective in achieving modest increases in physical activity at least 3 months post-intervention completion. Small improvements were also evident in control groups suggesting low-intensity interventions may be sufficient in promoting small changes in behaviour that last beyond intervention completion.

Initial evidence indicates that exercise is feasible and may provide physiological and psychological benefits for cancer survivors during the rehabilitation period. The evidence strongly supports the integration of exercise programs into comprehensive survivorship care.

### Cognitive Rehabilitation

For survivors experiencing cognitive difficulties, specialized rehabilitation approaches have shown promise. The available evidence supports clinical implementation of cognitive rehabilitation to improve CRCD (cancer-related cognitive dysfunction), with further work in program development, dissemination, and feasibility recommended.

All studies found improvements on at least one cognitive measure (performance-based or self-reported). By cognitive domain, objective improvements in memory were most commonly reported, followed by executive functions and processing speed.

## Prehabilitation

An emerging concept in cancer care is prehabilitation, designed to optimize patient function before treatment begins. Prehabilitation is defined as a process on the cancer continuum of care that occurs between the time of diagnosis and the beginning of acute treatment and includes physical and psychological assessments that establish a baseline functional level, identify impairments, and provide targeted interventions that promote physical and psychological health to reduce the incidence and/or severity of future impairments.

## Return to Work and Employment

Employment represents a critical aspect of rehabilitation for working-age cancer survivors. Research shows that among the approximately 15.5 million survivors in the United States, about 7 million are of working age. Employment represents a key element of quality of life, and survivors are very motivated to keep working to retain their health insurance and to combat financial toxicity, as well as to maintain a sense of normalcy, self-worth, and accomplishment.

About half of women with breast cancer reported that cancer treatment interfered with their physical efforts at work. These women also reported difficulty with concentration (31 percent), the ability to do analysis (28 percent), keeping the pace set by others (39 percent), and learning new things (20 percent).

## Guidelines and Standards

Guidelines promote high quality cancer care. Rehabilitation recommendations in oncology guidelines have not been characterized and may provide insight to improve integration of rehabilitation into oncology care. Findings identify guidelines that recommend rehabilitation services across many cancer types and for various consequences of cancer treatment signifying that rehabilitation is a recognized component of oncology care.

Despite these recommendations, these findings are at odds with clinical reports of low rehabilitation utilization rates suggesting that guideline recommendations may be overlooked. Considering that functional morbidity negatively affects a majority of cancer survivors, improving guideline concordant rehabilitative care could have substantial impact on function and quality of life among cancer survivors.
