title: Quality of Life after Cancer
---


Quality of life encompasses multiple dimensions of well-being, including physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects. For cancer survivors, quality of life is influenced by treatment-related effects, psychosocial adjustment, social support, and economic factors.

## Comprehensive Quality of Life Assessment

There is increasing awareness of the importance of using patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to accurately assess these effects in cancer survivors. Multiple studies have demonstrated that PROs more accurately capture patient symptoms than physician assessment.

## Long-term Symptom Burden

Symptom burden associated with cancer survivorship was consistent among the four most common types of cancer (breast, gynecological, prostate, and rectal/colon), despite various types of treatment exposure. The symptoms include physical limitations, cognitive limitations, depression/anxiety, sleep problems, fatigue, pain, and sexual dysfunctions.

## Family and Caregiver Impact

Cancer's impact extends beyond the patient to family members and caregivers, affecting their quality of life and well-being. There were approximately 43.5 million adults in the United States providing care to an adult or child in the preceding 12 months, and cancer was identified as the fourth main reason for which people needed a family caregiver. The vast majority (88 percent) of cancer caregivers provide care to a relative.

The emotional toll on caregivers is significant. Emotional distress such as anxiety and depression are high (approximately 38 percent) among caregivers at 2 years postdiagnosis and persist at 5 years (approximately 21 percent). The rates of anxiety and depression were higher among caregivers of cancer patients than they were for caregivers of other types of patients.

## Financial Toxicity and Quality of Life

Financial concerns represent a significant factor affecting quality of life for many cancer survivors, with the emergence of "financial toxicity" as a recognized clinical syndrome.

### Prevalence and Impact

A substantial proportion of cancer survivors experience financial hardship irrespective of how it is measured. The most commonly reported factors associated with FT were: being female, younger age, low income at baseline, adjuvant therapies and more recent diagnosis. A total of 28-48% of patients reported FT using monetary measures and 16-73% using subjective measures.

Cancer survivors often face income loss and additional expenses, leading to ongoing financial difficulties that affect their psychological well-being. Despite this significant impact, there is a lack of guidance and support to help them manage these financial challenges.

### Understanding Financial Toxicity

Financial toxicity is more than costs of care: it includes the topics "Coping with cancer and employment," "Coping with limited economic resources," and "Maintaining care resources while facing economic pressure." The results highlight the importance of screening for the risk of financial toxicity in the clinical context and individual risk and resource assessment.

Cancer survivors incur FT; however, their awareness of FT is limited. Cancer-related FT has multiple impacts on survivors' lives. Although cancer survivors try to cope with FT through adjustments, they still have unmet needs for the management of FT.

### Interventions for Financial Toxicity

Research has begun to identify effective interventions to address financial toxicity. The primary strategy to intervene on FT at the patient level is financial navigation. Financial navigation uses comprehensive assessment of patients' risk factors for FT, guidance toward support resources, and referrals to assist patient financial needs during cancer care.

A variety of interventions have been tested to mitigate financial hardship. Financial navigation can mitigate financial worry among high-risk patients. However, more research is needed to identify the most effective approaches for different populations and care settings.

## Survivorship Care Plans

Survivorship care plans have emerged as an important tool for addressing quality of life concerns, though their effectiveness remains under investigation. Several organizations recommend that cancer survivors receive a survivorship care plan (SCP) comprising a treatment summary and follow-up care plans. However, the impact of SCPs on cancer survivors and health care professionals is unclear.

Meta-analysis results showed no significant differences between SCP recipients and controls at 6 months postintervention on self-reported cancer and survivorship knowledge, physical functioning, satisfaction with information provision, or self-efficacy or at 12 months on anxiety, cancer-specific distress, depression, or satisfaction with follow-up care. SCPs appear to be acceptable and potentially improve survivors' adherence to medical recommendations and health care professionals' knowledge of survivorship care and late effects.

## Models of Survivorship Care

Various models of care have been developed to optimize quality of life outcomes for cancer survivors. Cancer survivor risk stratification will affect timing of support needs, and survivorship care programs need to provide repeated assessments over time of their key outcomes to explore how (or whether) outcomes change with additional followup interactions or increased duration of followup.

The development of risk-stratified approaches represents a promising direction for improving care efficiency and effectiveness while optimizing resource utilization.
