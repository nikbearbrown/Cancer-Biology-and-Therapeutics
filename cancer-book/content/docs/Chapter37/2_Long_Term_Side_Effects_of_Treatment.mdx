title: Long-Term Side Effects of Treatment
---


Cancer survivors face an extensive array of potential long-term and late effects from their treatment, affecting virtually every organ system. Based on longitudinal and cross-sectional evidence, cancer survivors can experience symptoms for more than 10 years following treatment. These symptoms were present in survivors of all four cancer types who underwent a wide variety of treatment. Research demonstrates that as many as two-thirds of survivors will experience a late effect of chemotherapy or radiation, defined as any chronic or late occurring outcome—physical or psychosocial—that persists or develops beyond five years from the diagnosis of the cancer.

## Physical Late Effects

The spectrum of physical late effects is extensive and multifaceted, affecting multiple physiological systems. Research shows that other physical problems in addition to a patient's primary cancer also contribute to the mortality risk of long-term cancer survivors: An analysis of late mortality in approximately 700 patients diagnosed as adults with Hodgkin's lymphoma indicated that by about 23 years after a cancer diagnosis, the risk of death from the original cancer was exceeded by deaths due to cardiac disease, second cancers, and other problems.

### Cardiovascular Complications

Cardiovascular effects represent one of the most significant concerns for long-term survivors, particularly those treated with cardiotoxic therapies. Studies show a marked elevation in risk of coronary artery disease among both men and women treated with mediastinal radiotherapy. The risk for women aged 35, 45, and 50 is as high as for men of the same age, and there is a one in five chance of having symptomatic coronary artery disease by 20 years following moderate dose radiation to the mediastinal area.

For breast cancer survivors, cardiovascular comorbidities are particularly prevalent. Among women aged 50 and older with estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer, the probability of dying from breast cancer is relatively low and the risk of dying from other causes increases over time. These deaths are largely attributable to aging and often a common insulin-resistance pathway that leads to both cardiovascular disease and breast cancer.

### Second Primary Cancers

The development of subsequent malignancies represents a major long-term concern for cancer survivors. One out of every five new cancers diagnosed in the United States is a second, third, or fourth cancer for the patient. The factors contributing to a subsequent primary cancer include unhealthy behaviors (e.g., tobacco use, sedentary lifestyle, obesity), aging (patients 65 and older account for two-thirds of cancers), genetic factors, treatment exposures from the first cancer, and interactions among these factors.

### Fatigue and Sleep Disorders

Cancer-related fatigue remains one of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms experienced by survivors. Fatigue and disturbed sleep were the most common symptoms reported out of 13 possible symptoms in one survey of more than 2,800 patients with breast, colorectal, prostate, or lung cancer, with approximately 33 percent of patients who had completed primary cancer therapy reporting three or more moderate to severe symptoms.

The underlying mechanisms of persistent fatigue are complex and multifactorial. One of the best studied biological explanations for persistent fatigue is inappropriate activation of the cytokine network, either because of the disease or the treatment. Risk factors for posttreatment fatigue include the presence of pretreatment fatigue, greater body mass index, and the type of cancer treatment.

### Cancer-Related Cognitive Impairment

Cognitive dysfunction, often referred to as "chemobrain" or "cancer-related cognitive impairment" (CRCI), affects a significant proportion of cancer survivors. Cognitive rehabilitation appear beneficial for cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). Differential effects on specific cognitive domains (eg, processing speed) and subjective cognition may exist between intervention types.

CRCI is multifactorial and affected individuals frequently experience high levels of fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression and are most likely to benefit from holistic approaches that include cognition, physical activity, relaxation, psychoeducation, group support and/or psychological counselling.

## Special Considerations for Pediatric Survivors

Childhood cancer survivors face unique challenges due to their young age at treatment and the potential for treatment to interfere with normal development. Most survivors will experience at least one and often multiple cancer- and treatment-related late effects throughout their lives, including endocrine complications. The European survivor population of 300,000-500,000 continues to expand, highlighting the growing need for specialized long-term follow-up care.

More than 40 percent of pediatric cancer survivors develop a severe or life-threatening chronic health condition within 30 years of diagnosis. Overall, childhood cancer survivors have about a five- to six-fold increased risk of developing a secondary cancer.
