title: 21.4 Side Effects and Management
---



## 21.4.1 Classification of Radiation Effects

Side effects of radiotherapy are classified as acute (early), consequential, or late effects on normal tissues over time. Acute radiation toxicity is seen within a few weeks after treatment and usually involves intermitotic cells (skin and mucosa), while late complications emerge months to years after exposure and usually involve postmitotic cells (liver, kidney, heart, muscle, and bone).

**Acute Effects:**
Acute radiation damage predominantly involves rapidly proliferating cells, such as epithelial surfaces of the skin or digestive tract, manifesting when tissues are lost as part of normal cell turnover but there is inadequate replacement by damaged stem cells.

**Late Effects:**
Late complications occur in tissues with slow turnover, such as brain, kidney, liver, intestinal wall, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle, with consequences including fibrosis, atrophy, necrosis, and vascular damage.

## 21.4.2 Head and Neck Radiation Effects

**Skin and Mucosa:**
Acute responses include erythema, inflammation, desquamation, mucositis, pruritis, hypersensitivity, pain, and mucosal ulcers, with severe mucositis potentially requiring feeding tube placement. Late complications include alopecia, telangiectasia, fibrosis of masticator muscles resulting in trismus in 5-10% of patients, alterations in taste sensations, and dysphagia.

**Management:**
Management of severe mucositis includes scrupulous oral hygiene, topical analgesics, dietary modification, opioid analgesics, doxepin rinses, antacid+diphenhydramine mouthwash, mucoadhesive hydrogel, and enteral tube feeding in severe cases.

**Salivary Glands:**
Salivary gland irradiation may result in cell death by apoptosis, manifesting as swelling and tenderness after the first dose, progressing to xerostomia and subsequent severe dental caries and osteonecrosis. Management includes appropriate oral hygiene and dental care with fluoride treatment, chlorhexidine rinses, and regular dental follow-up.

## 21.4.3 Thoracic Radiation Effects

**Pulmonary Toxicity:**
Early phase effects include congestion, cough, dyspnea, fever, and chest pain caused by radiation pneumonitis, with radiographic infiltrates within the irradiated field. The natural course involves either gradual resolution or progression to chronic inflammation and fibrosis developing over months to years.

**Cardiac Toxicity:**
Radiation injury to the heart can manifest as acute pericarditis, pericardial effusion, constrictive pericarditis, valvular dysfunction, conductive system dysfunction, and myocardial fibrosis. Long-term effects manifest approximately ten years after treatment and contribute to high mortality in younger women diagnosed with breast cancer.

## 21.4.4 Abdominal and Pelvic Radiation Effects

**Gastrointestinal Toxicity:**
Acute toxicity presents as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea about 2-3 weeks after radiation therapy. Chronic effects include chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, recurrent bouts of ileus or obstruction, and proliferative mucosal telangiectasias or ulceration.

**Urinary Tract Effects:**
Radiation can cause varying degrees of bladder irritation, from mild dysuria, increased frequency, and urgency to urinary incontinence, gross hematuria, and bladder necrosis. Treatment is symptomatic with pain management, anticholinergics or antispasmodics, cranberry juice, hyperbaric oxygen, or surgical interventions for late complications.

**Reproductive Effects:**
Irradiation to ovaries leads to infertility or premature ovarian failure even at low doses, with increased sensitivity with advancing age. Patients undergoing radiotherapy should be offered sperm or egg cryopreservation options before treatment.

## 21.4.5 Secondary Malignancies

Radiation induces secondary malignancies with absolute risk ranging between 0.2% to 1% per year in cancer survivors after radiotherapy. There is a bimodal distribution: the first peak within three years is predominantly hematological malignancies like acute leukemias, while the second peak over ten years is driven primarily by solid malignancies.

**Common Secondary Malignancies by Primary Site:**
Hodgkin disease patients develop breast, lung, thyroid, and stomach cancers; breast cancer patients develop lung, leukemia, and opposite breast cancers; cervical cancer patients develop bladder, rectum, leukemia, and sarcomas.

## 21.4.6 Management Strategies

**Prevention and Risk Reduction:**
Techniques to reduce side effects include stereotactic surgery and SBRT for precise dose delivery, brachytherapy for localized treatment, appropriate fractionation schedules, and image-guided radiation therapy for precise targeting.

**Supportive Care:**
Coordination of care by surgical and medical oncologists, pathologists, radiotherapists, and interdisciplinary teams including oncology nurses, psychiatrists, nutritionists, and pain management services can significantly reduce toxicity and improve long-term quality of life.

**Risk Stratification:**
Identification of patients at higher risk includes those with active collagen vascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerotic vascular diseases, advanced age, and extreme BMI values.

## 21.4.7 Long-term Monitoring

Improved cure rates of all malignancies have resulted in more providers confronting patients with a wide range of chronic morbidities in long-term survivors, making awareness of common adverse effects essential for all healthcare providers.

**Surveillance Requirements:**
- Regular cardiovascular screening for thoracic radiation patients
- Pulmonary function monitoring for lung radiation
- Endocrine function assessment for head/neck radiation
- Secondary malignancy screening based on primary treatment site
- Functional assessment for organ-specific late effects

The comprehensive understanding of radiation biology, technological advances, and systematic management of side effects has transformed radiation oncology into a precise, effective treatment modality. RT is now recognized as an essential element of effective cancer care programs throughout the world, with the potential to improve cure rates of 3.5 million people and provide palliative relief for an additional 3.5 million people annually. Continued technological advancement and improved understanding of radiation biology will further enhance the therapeutic ratio, maximizing tumor control while minimizing normal tissue toxicity.
