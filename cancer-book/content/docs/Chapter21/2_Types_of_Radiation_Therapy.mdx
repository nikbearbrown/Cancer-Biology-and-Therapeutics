## 21.2.1 External Beam Radiation Therapy

External beam radiation therapy is applied externally through directed beams of radiation to treat cancer deep within the body. The goal of external beam radiation therapy is to deliver the prescribed amount of radiation to the targeted tumor while minimizing the amount received by surrounding normal tissues.

**Two-Dimensional Radiation Therapy (2D-RT):**
Prior to sophisticated computerized treatment planning, RT was planned using clinical information and conventional X-rays for field placement verification, resulting in large radiotherapy fields that assured tumor coverage but also caused limiting toxicity.

**Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT):**
With the introduction of computerized tomography scanners and treatment planning, radiation fields were shaped to correspond to tumors, resulting in less toxicity and the ability to escalate radiation dose with improved outcomes. 3D-CRT uses three-dimensional pictures of the cancer from CT or MRI scans, allowing more precise targeting and enabling higher doses while reducing damage to healthy tissue.

**Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT):**
IMRT allows shaping of the radiation field to deposit higher doses to tumors while further sparing surrounding normal tissues. IMRT delivers conformal radiation to the target tumor by "crossing" multiple properly shaped beams of various intensities through paths that spare radiosensitive and critical adjacent tissues.

## 21.2.2 Brachytherapy

Brachytherapy is applied through the insertion of radiation-emitting sources directly within the tumor or adjacent body cavity. Brachytherapy is a radiotherapy technique where radioactive devices are inserted near tumors to safely deliver high doses of radiation to eliminate and shrink tumors.

**Types of Brachytherapy:**

**Low-Dose Rate (LDR) Brachytherapy:**
LDR brachytherapy dose rates are in the range of 0.4-2 Gy/hr, with delivery being continuous. Low-dose rate brachytherapy involves sources remaining in tissues for several days.

**High-Dose Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy:**
High-dose rate brachytherapy delivers a single dose of radiation within minutes using higher-activity sources that are electromechanically guided to tumors. HDR delivery occurs over several minutes with time gaps of hours to days between fractions.

**Clinical Applications:**
Brachytherapy is used extensively for prostate cancer, with biochemical control rates ranging from 85 to 97% at five years for low and intermediate-risk disease. For cervical cancer, brachytherapy is typically delivered as a boost with external beam radiotherapy for patients with Stage IB3-IVA disease.

## 21.2.3 Systemic Radiation Therapy

Radioisotope therapy is applied through the systemic injection of a radioisotope that has been designed to target specific tissues. Targeted radionuclide therapy uses molecules labeled with radionuclides to deliver toxic levels of radiation to disease sites, combining the specificity of cancer cell targeting with the known antitumor effects of ionizing radiation.

**Mechanisms:**
Unlike tumor-directed drugs that kill only directly targeted cells, radionuclides can exert a "bystander" or "crossfire" effect, potentially destroying adjacent tumor cells even if they lack the specific tumor-associated antigen or receptor.

**Clinical Applications:**
Common applications include treatment of thyroid cancer using radioactive iodine and palliation of pain from bone metastases using radioactive strontium. Advanced approaches include lutetium (177Lu) DOTA-TATE for targeting somatostatin-expressing neuroendocrine tumors.
