## 21.3.1 Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)

IMRT controls or modulates the radiation beam's intensity to make the radiation delivered more tightly conform with the 3D shape of the tumor. IMRT is a more complex form of radiation where the intensity of radiation is varied within each field, unlike conventional 3D-CRT which uses the same intensity throughout each beam.

**Advantages:**
Intensity modulation has permitted radiation oncologists to place sharper dose gradients across normal tissue structures, including bladder and rectum, with increased dose to tumor target, allowing higher doses with no additional clinical morbidity.

**Potential Concerns:**
IMRT has a higher integral radiation dose and increases the total volume of tissues exposed to radiation compared to conventional radiation therapy, which may theoretically translate to higher risk for secondary radiation-induced malignancies, especially in pediatric populations.

## 21.3.2 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)

SBRT is defined as an external beam radiation therapy method used to very precisely deliver a high dose of radiation to an extracranial target within the body, using either a single dose or a small number of fractions. SBRT combines multiple finely collimated radiation beams and stereotaxy (3D target localization), with multiple radiation beams intersecting to deliver an accurate, high dose of radiation to a carefully defined location.

**Technical Requirements:**
SBRT requires advanced patient positioning, patient immobilization, multi-leaf collimators (MLCs) and micro-MLCs, x-ray tracking (stereotactic), advanced control systems, and treatment planning software.

**Advantages:**
SBRT's most important features include the use of high-dose radiation delivered in one to five fractions within a few days, decreasing the overall length of treatment compared to standard fractionated radiotherapy which typically requires 25-50 fractions over 5-10 weeks.

**Clinical Applications:**
SBRT can be used as primary therapy for early-stage cancer or as targeted treatment for metastatic disease, with applications in lung/thorax, pancreas, liver, colon, kidney, and prostate tumors.

## 21.3.3 Proton Therapy

Charged particle radiotherapy uses beams of protons or other charged particles such as helium, carbon, or other ions instead of photons. Proton beam therapy uses protons rather than x-rays, and at high energy, protons can destroy cancer cells while depositing very little radiation dose beyond the tumor compared to x-rays.

**Physical Advantages:**
Charged particles have different depth-dose distributions compared to photons, with the ability to cover tumor areas using a single radiation field, achieving significant dose reduction to normal tissues beyond the target. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of protons is approximately 1.1 compared to conventional photon therapy.

**Advanced Techniques:**
Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) uses a narrow proton beam that is "scanned" over the target volume by magnetic field while both the energy and intensity of the beam are modulated.

## 21.3.4 Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT)

Image-guided radiation therapy uses daily images of each treatment field to confirm patient positioning and ensure the target is in the field, allowing better tumor targeting and reduced damage to healthy tissue. In the past 10 years, X-ray and CT imaging capabilities have been added to treatment machines to allow therapists to guide radiation placement with increased precision and accuracy.

**Technologies:**
SBRT devices can use image guidance including kV or MV x-ray imaging, CT, or ultrasound to intermittently monitor the position of the targeted tumor by tracking bony structures or implanted fiducials.
