## 7.8.1 Biomarker Applications

Recent cancer genome sequencing projects have revealed that numerous epigenetic regulators are frequently mutated in various cancers. This information has not only started to be utilized as prognostic and predictive markers to guide treatment decisions but also provided important information for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in both physiological and pathological conditions.

## 7.8.2 Personalized Medicine

The identification of mutations in writers, readers, and erasers, as well as alterations in the epigenetic landscape in cancers, do not only imply a causative role for these factors in cancer initiation and progression but also provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

## 7.8.3 Future Research Directions

Studies of intragenic and distant intergenic alterations in DNA methylation will help elucidate the nature of epigenetic deregulation in diseases, especially for cancer. The epigenetic signatures of various cancers can be targeted via epigenetic drugs or other genome editing tools, ultimately bringing specific treatment options for different cancer types.
