## 7.5.1 Cellular Memory Systems

The identity of cells in an organism is largely defined by their specific transcriptional profile. During cell division, these profiles need to be faithfully inherited to the daughter cells to ensure the maintenance of cell structure and function in a cell lineage. Two groups of chromatin regulators, the Polycomb group (PcG) and the Trithorax group (TrxG), act in an antagonistic manner to maintain differential gene expression states.

Members of the PcG cooperate in large multiprotein complexes to modify histones with repressive marks, resulting in condensed chromatin domains. Conversely, the TrxG proteins counteract the repressed domains by opening nucleosomal structures and establishing activating histone modifications.

## 7.5.2 Clinical Relevance in Cancer

The human TrxG gene Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL1) was initially identified as a chromosomal translocation found in blood cells and causing acute lymphoblastic or myeloid leukemia. MLL1 codes, as its Drosophila ortholog trithorax (trx), for a histone 3 lysine 4 methyltransferase (KMT), catalyzing the addition of the positive histone mark H3K4me3.

A major hallmark of PcG silencing is the H3K27me3 histone modification observed primarily at repressive elements and connected promoters but also extending largely over the body of the repressed gene.

## 7.5.3 Bivalent Chromatin and Cancer

With ongoing developmental time and programming, the signals are resolved into either a complete H3K27me3 pattern (and/or in the case of mammals with additional DNA methylation signals) when the gene is repressed or a complete H3K4me3 (and accompanying H3/H4 acetylation) when the gene is active. This site-specific anti-repressor capability of members of the TrxG provides a means for how localized competition can switch the expression state from silenced to activated, also known as the "bivalent master switch" model.
