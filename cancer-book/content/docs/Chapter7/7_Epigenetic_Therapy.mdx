## 7.7.1 Therapeutic Rationale

The reversible nature of epigenetic aberrations has led to the emergence of the promising field of epigenetic therapy that has already provided new therapeutic options for patients with malignancies characterized by epigenetic alterations, laying the basis for new and personalized medicine.

The most promising way to treat diseases through epigenetic regulation has been through pharmacology. Previous clinical trials for drugs formulated to block epigenetic modifications associated with cancers have proved successful.

## 7.7.2 FDA-Approved Epigenetic Drugs

The FDA has approved a number of these drugs which target epigenetic regulators to treat various cancers including:

- **Azacytidine and decitabine** for myelodysplastic syndrome
- **Panobinostat** for multiple myeloma
- **Romidepsin** for cutaneous T cell lymphoma

More drugs are likely to be approved in the coming years as a number of clinical trials for DNA methylation inhibitors and histone modification inhibitors are underway.

## 7.7.3 DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors

Azacitidine and decitabine are nucleotide analogues that are used as inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases. These nucleotide analogues can be incorporated during DNA replication instead of cytosine and covalently bind DNMT1, impairing the inheritance of DNA methylation during DNA replication.

It is important to note that, in addition to the demethylating effect of these compounds, also the trapping of DNMT proteins on the DNA might indirectly contribute to an anti-cancer effect. Recently, it has also been shown that treatment with DNMT inhibitors induces immune signaling in cancer cells through the upregulation of a wide range of genes implicated in immune signaling and increased numbers of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.

## 7.7.4 Combination Therapies

Transcriptional silencing mediated by DNA methylation is also related to the recruitment of co-repressors and deacetylation or methylation of histone marks at promoters and enhancers. Accordingly, the combinatorial use of DNMT and histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors was shown to enhance reactivation of aberrantly silenced genes in tumor cells and cause reductions in tumor burden.

## 7.7.5 Synthetic Lethality Approaches

Some cancer cells are "addicted" to a particular DNA damage response (DDR) pathway to partially maintain the genomic stability if the primary DDR pathway is already inactivated by genetic or epigenetic changes. By targeting the salvage DDR pathway, cancer cell killing can be achieved through a mechanism known as synthetic lethality.

So far, only PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have been approved for metastatic cancer management. PARP inhibitors are currently used in the management of tumors with absent or dysfunctional BRCA genes such as breast and ovarian cancers.
