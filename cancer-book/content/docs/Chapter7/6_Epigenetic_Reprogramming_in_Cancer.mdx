## 7.6.1 Cancer as Epigenetic Disease

With accumulating mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, the cells lose their contacts with the neighbors, start to over-proliferate, change metabolic behavior, and eventually migrate to create the deadly metastases. Cancer is also a disease of transcriptional mis-regulation and, given the role of chromatin in this process, it is not surprising to realize that many mutations in chromatin-controlling factors have been observed in human cancers.

Mutations ensure the long-term phenotypic change of cancer cells. However, epigenetic marks like DNA methylation or histone modifications can also contribute to these changes, and importantly, these epigenetic alterations may be reversible.

## 7.6.2 Epigenetic Changes in Carcinogenesis

Recent research suggests that cell initiation may result from epigenetic changes rather than genetic mutations. Environmental factors, such as exposure to non-mutagenic carcinogens, can trigger these epigenetic events. These modifications may serve as the initial alteration in cell properties, potentially leading to the development of the first hallmark of cancer.

Alternatively, these epigenetic changes may prime cells to respond more readily to a subsequent genetic mutation. Conversely, an epigenetic mutation may arise from a mutation in genes that regulate epigenetic processes, such as DNA methyltransferase genes DNMT1 and DNMT3A.

## 7.6.3 Stem Cells and Epigenetic Cancer

There is a growing body of data suggesting that cancer "stem/initiating cells", especially when they may dominate in the most aggressive forms of human tumors, have a gene expression signature reminiscent of embryonic stem (ES) cells. A key part of this signature is an increase in polycomb protein group (PcG) complex constituents, and a decrease in expression of a group of genes for which PcG targeting is normally key to maintaining a poised, low basal activity.
