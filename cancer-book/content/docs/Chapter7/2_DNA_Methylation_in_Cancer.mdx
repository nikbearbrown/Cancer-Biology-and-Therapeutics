## 7.2.1 Molecular Basis of DNA Methylation

DNA methylation provides a stable gene silencing mechanism that plays an important role in regulating gene expression and chromatin architecture in association with histone modifications and other chromatin associated proteins. The mechanism is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes.

During cell division, genome-wide patterns of DNA and histone modifications are established during early development and are maintained throughout multiple cell divisions. The cytosine base of DNA in animal and plant genomes can be chemically modified to 5-methyl-cytosine (5mC).

## 7.2.2 DNA Methylation Alterations in Cancer

Aberrant DNA methylation was the first epigenetic abnormality to be identified in human cancers. Alterations detected in cancers include:

1. **Promoter hypermethylation**: The consequent silencing of tumor suppressor genes
2. **Global hypomethylation**: Associated with genomic instability
3. **Alterations of DNA methylation at imprinting control regions**: With consequent loss of imprinting

**Genomic Hypomethylation**

Genomic hypomethylation contributes to genetic instability and proto-oncogene hypomethylation, which is responsible for their stronger expression. This general decline in the level of methylated cytosine is accompanied by local locus-specific hypermethylation.

**Promoter Hypermethylation**

Functional silencing of tumor-associated genes is usually associated with local promoter hypermethylation. Regions of low-density methylation near CpG islands, known as 'shores', exhibit great variation in DNA methylation, including hypomethylation and hypermethylation, across different types of cancers.

## 7.2.3 Clinical Examples

Promoter hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene have been widely described in glioma. Epigenetic silencing of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene by promoter methylation has been associated with better response to temozolomide (an alkylating agent) because the MGMT gene encodes a DNA-repair protein that removes alkyl groups from the O6 position of guanine.
