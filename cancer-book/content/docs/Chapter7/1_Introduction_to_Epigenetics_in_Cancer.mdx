title: 7.1 Introduction to Epigenetics in Cancer

## 7.1.1 Definition and Scope

Epigenetics is the study of heritable and stable changes in gene expression that occur through alterations in the chromosome rather than in the DNA sequence. Despite not directly altering the DNA sequence, epigenetic mechanisms can regulate gene expression through chemical modifications of DNA bases and changes to the chromosomal superstructure in which DNA is packaged.

The past decade has seen a remarkable acceleration in the validation of the concept that cancer is not only a genetic disease but also one of epigenetic abnormalities. This view has been significantly strengthened by whole-genome sequencing results showing that numerous epigenetic regulators are frequently the target of mutations and epimutations in cancer cells, with an intriguing interplay between the two.

## 7.1.2 Fundamental Epigenetic Mechanisms

Three different epigenetic mechanisms have been identified that play crucial roles in cancer development:

1. **DNA methylation**: Involves the addition of a methyl group directly to a cytosine nucleotide
2. **Histone modifications**: Chemical changes to histone proteins that package DNA
3. **Non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing**: Regulation through RNA molecules that do not code for proteins

These mechanisms form a layer of control within a cell that regulates gene expression and silencing. This control varies between tissues and plays an important role in cell differentiation. Additionally, differences in gene expression between cells, which are driven by epigenetic modifications, result in the unique function of specific cell types.

## 7.1.3 Epigenetic Alterations in Cancer

In cancer, the normal epigenetic patterns are disrupted resulting in the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes like CDKN2A. The abundance of cancer mutations involving epigenetic regulator genes practically affects all levels of epigenetic regulation, including key players in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin organization but also substrates for these modifications, such as histones.

Alterations in chromatin function and epigenetic mechanisms are a hallmark of cancer. The disruption of epigenetic processes has been linked to altered gene expression and to cancer initiation and progression.
