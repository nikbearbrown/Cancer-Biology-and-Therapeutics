## 7.4.1 Overview of Non-coding RNAs

A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule that is transcribed but not translated into proteins. Once regarded as waste of the genome, recent insight suggests the ncRNA molecules harbor a crucial role in epigenetic gene expression and likely account for the great difference in phenotype between species and within human populations despite such similarity in encoded proteins.

Notable ncRNA molecules include:
- **MicroRNAs (miRNA) and short interfering RNAs (siRNA)**: Which include less than 30 nucleotides
- **Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA)**: Which are 200 nucleotides or longer

Though the full extent of their role in epigenetics is still being determined, there is evidence suggesting that ncRNAs participate in DNA methylation and histone modifications in addition to gene silencing. siRNAs and lncRNAs both have been shown to regulate gene expression by the formation of heterochromatin.

## 7.4.2 MicroRNAs in Cancer

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. They are linked to many developmental and pathological states including wound healing, cancer invasion, and metastasis, the primary cause of cancer-related death.

**Structure and Biogenesis**

MicroRNA is a class of abundant, genetically robust, non-coding, 18-25 nucleotide (nt), single-stranded oligoribonucleotides found in animals, plants, green algae, and viruses. MicroRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by targeting specific messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts for translational inhibition or degradation.

**Canonical Biogenesis Pathway**

MicroRNAs are transcribed on long primary transcripts (pri-miRNA) then cleaved by Drosha to form a 60-80 nt pre-miRNA, which is exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 and Ran-GTP. The pre-miRNA is cleaved by Dicer. Argonaute (Ago) proteins incorporate the duplex and separate the two strands. The miRNA-Ago association forms the core of the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC), which assists in the annealing of the miRNA to its target mRNA.

**Clinical Applications**

miRNAs are critical regulators of gene expression, and consequently, the defective miRNA biogenesis observed in cancer makes a crucial contribution to cancer development. Large cohort studies have identified miRNAs that are differentially expressed between normal colon and tumor epithelium, and further indicate that miRNA profiles might be able to differentiate between cancer subtypes.

**miRNA-21 as a Biomarker**

Several studies utilizing microRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) have been reported. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio and diagnostic odd ratio of microRNAs for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer were 0.81, 0.78, 4.14, 0.24, and 19.2, respectively. miR-21 is a promising biomarker for early detection and prognosis of colorectal cancer.

## 7.4.3 Long Non-coding RNAs in Cancer

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) range in size from 200 to several thousand nucleotides and mediate critical cellular functions, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, subcellular trafficking and organelle biogenesis. It is therefore not surprising that recent studies have implicated their aberrant expression in behaviors that contribute to disease, including metastasis.

**Historical Context**

Empirical evidence of 'unique' heterogeneous nuclear-confined RNA (hnRNA) has been known for over 40 years. The nature of some hnRNA unique to the nucleus could be explained by the ensuing discovery that genes were mosaics comprised of protein-coding regions interspersed with non-coding 'silent' regions, termed 'exons' and 'introns', respectively.

**Clinical Significance**

The first human long non-coding RNA to be causally linked to cancer was the maternally expressed H19 gene. The 2.3kb imprinted H19 transcript has been linked to several human malignancies, including breast cancer. Although some studies have assigned a tumor suppressor role to H19, the overwhelming evidence is consistent with promotion of malignancy.
