title: 8.1 Chemical Carcinogens

## 8.1.1 Overview and Classification

Substances that cause cancer, called carcinogens, have been identified both by studies in experimental animals and by epidemiological analysis of cancer frequencies in human populations. Chemical carcinogens represent a diverse group of substances that can induce cancer through various mechanisms.

The level of risk associated with a carcinogenic agent depends on both the potency of the agent and the level of exposure to it. Carcinogenic potency can be estimated, fairly crudely, using clinical and epidemiologic data on humans or toxicologic data derived from animal cancer tests.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies carcinogens based on the strength of evidence:
- **Group 1**: Carcinogenic to humans
- **Group 2A**: Probably carcinogenic to humans  
- **Group 2B**: Possibly carcinogenic to humans
- **Group 3**: Not classifiable as to carcinogenicity
- **Group 4**: Probably not carcinogenic to humans

## 8.1.2 Mechanisms of Chemical Carcinogenesis

Carcinogenesis often appears to proceed by a multistep process, the first being an initiation event with subsequent promotional events that can often occur much later. This multistep process has been characterized through decades of research:

**Initiation, Promotion, and Progression**

In 1969, FOULDS had the intuition in the natural history of cancer of its stage evolution, and in 1982, BERENBLUM established three distinct stages: the initiation stage, the promotion stage and the progression stage.

1. **Initiation**: The induction of mutations in key target genes is thought to be the initial event leading to cancer development.

2. **Promotion**: Some substances known as tumor promoters, which are not themselves mutagenic, can cause cancer selectively in skin previously exposed to an initiator.

3. **Progression**: The transformation of initiated cells into fully malignant cancer cells.

**DNA Damage and Repair**

Radiation and many chemical carcinogens act by damaging DNA and inducing mutations. These enzymes normally help to convert ingested toxins into harmless and easily excreted compounds. Unfortunately, their activity on certain chemicals generates products that are highly mutagenic.

## 8.1.3 Major Classes of Chemical Carcinogens

**Tobacco Smoke Carcinogens**

Each puff of each cigarette contains a mixture of thousands of compounds, including more than 60 well-established carcinogens. The carcinogens in cigarette smoke belong to multiple chemical classes, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), N-nitrosamines, aromatic amines, aldehydes, volatile organic hydrocarbons, and metals.

The carcinogens in tobacco smoke (including benzo(a)pyrene, dimethylnitrosamine, and nickel compounds) are the major identified causes of human cancer. Smoking is the undisputed cause of 80 to 90% of lung cancers, as well as being implicated in cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and other sites.

**Aflatoxins**

The experiments performed on different animal species (fish, birds and mammals) have shown that AFB1 is carcinogenic. The carcinogenetic potential of aflatoxins has been determined to be in decreasing order: AFB1, AFG1, AFB2 and AFG2.

Cycasin (methylazoxymethanol-β-glucoside) is one of the most potent carcinogens found in plants. This compound and at least one related glucoside (macrozamin) are present in the palmlike cycad trees of the family Cycadaceae.

**N-Nitroso Compounds**

N-nitroso compounds have been detected in foods, in gastrointestinal contents, and in blood or urine, there has been much concern during the past 10 to 15 years about the role of N-nitroso compounds in the etiology of human cancer.

**Dietary Carcinogens**

Most solid tumours, irrespective of their organ site, evolve through a 15–25-year period of biological development before they become clinically apparent. Consumption of processed meat was recently classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), joining the individual dietary contaminants aflatoxin and aristolochic acid in that category.

## 8.1.4 Risk Assessment and Prevention

When inferences about human risks are based on laboratory studies using animals, several reasons for uncertainty exist: uncertainty about extrapolations from the high-dose levels used in the laboratory to the lower levels of exposure typical of the human diet; about the relative sensitivity of animals and humans to the effects of carcinogenic or anticarcinogenic agents.

Animals maintained on a calorie-restricted diet have shown significant reduction in the rate of onset of tumor formation and adverse toxicity to chemicals recognized to initiate cancer or cell death.
