## 8.2.1 Types of Radiation

Radiation encompasses electromagnetic waves and energetic particles that can interact with biological tissues in different ways. The carcinogenic risk associated with exposure to ionizing radiation has been evaluated previously in the IARC Monographs: radon in Volume 43, X-rays, γ-rays, and neutrons in Volume 75, and some internally deposited radionuclides in Volume 78.

**Ionizing Radiation**

All living matter is composed of atoms joined into molecules by electron bonds. Ionizing radiation is energetic enough to displace atomic electrons and thus break the bonds that hold a molecule together.

Ionizing radiation has been called a "universal carcinogen" in that it will induce cancer in most tissues of most species at all ages, including the fetus. It is one of the few definitely established carcinogens in human beings, and perhaps the only one for which firm dose-response data in human populations are available.

**Ultraviolet Radiation**

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is electromagnetic radiation found between X-radiation and light in the electromagnetic spectrum. UVR can be divided into ultraviolet A (UVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), and ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation components.

Solar UV radiation has beneficial biological effects, including enabling vitamin D synthesis, but its adverse effects include the induction of skin cancers.

## 8.2.2 Mechanisms of Radiation Carcinogenesis

**DNA Damage**

Carcinogenesis is viewed as a multistep process in which two or more intracellular events are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.

Ionizing radiation also produces a whole range of effects with potential implications for carcinogenesis. For example, the patterns of gene and protein expression are critical in determining cellular function and response.

Two molecular mechanisms are currently considered important in the initiation of carcinogenesis: activation of proto-oncogenes and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes. Both sites of action are vulnerable to the lethal and mutagenic effects of UVR.

**Genomic Instability**

In addition to being capable of producing mutations directly in the irradiated cell, ionizing radiation can also lead to genomic instability, resulting in the cell and its progeny having a reduced ability to replicate the genotype faithfully and therefore showing a permanently increased rate of acquisition of alterations in the genome.

## 8.2.3 Evidence from Human Studies

**Atomic Bomb Survivors**

The studies of atomic bomb survivors have provided crucial evidence for radiation carcinogenesis. It is, however, a relatively weak carcinogen and mutagen when compared with certain chemical agents. The cancers induced by radiation are of the same histologic types as occur naturally, but the distribution of types may differ.

**UV Radiation and Skin Cancer**

Skin cancers occur in uniquely accessible sites and are caused by well-defined environmental agents; consequently, their formation illustrates numerous salient features of carcinogenesis.

On the basis of a large body of evidence from human and experimental studies, the monograph concludes that solar radiation is carcinogenic to humans, causing cutaneous malignant melanoma and non-melanocytic skin cancer.

**Experimental Evidence**

The experimental induction of skin cancers in mice following exposure to a mercury-arc lamp was first reported by Findlay (1928). Initially, haired albino mice were used, but hairless and nude mice are now preferred.

Hundreds of studies have clearly established the carcinogenic activity of UVR in mice. The action spectrum for ultraviolet-induced skin carcinogenesis in albino hairless mice has been determined and shows a peak in the UVB range (280–315 nm) and a steep decrease in the UVA range (315–400 nm).

## 8.2.4 Dose-Response Relationships

It has been generally accepted that radiation carcinogenesis is a stochastic process; that is, the probability of the occurrence of the effect increases with dose with no threshold, but the severity of the effect is not influenced by dose.

The relative importance of the linear and quadratic terms varies widely for different cells and tissues. The ratio α/β, which is the dose at which the linear and quadratic contributions to the biological effect are equal, may vary from about 1 Gray (Gy) to more than 10 Gy.
