## 8.3.1 Overview of Oncogenic Viruses

Approximately 12% of all human cancers have been attributed to viral infections. Although the known oncogenic viruses belong to different virus families, they often share several common traits, such as, viral cancers appear in the context of persistent infections, occur many years to decades after acute infection.

The IARC Monographs programme has classified 11 infectious agents, or groups of related agents, as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). These include one bacterium, seven viruses, and three macroparasites.

**Major Oncogenic Viruses**

The viruses are human papillomaviruses (HPVs), 13 subtypes of which are classified as carcinogenic, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and HIV-1.

## 8.3.2 Human Papillomaviruses (HPV)

**Virus Characteristics**

Papillomaviruses are small, non-enveloped, epitheliotropic, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect mucosal and cutaneous epithelia in a wide variety of higher vertebrates in a species-specific manner and induce cellular proliferation.

Unlike most other cancers, however, in which multiple environmental, biologic, and lifestyle determinants contribute independently or jointly to carcinogenesis, cervical cancer has been shown to have a central causal agent, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.

**Mechanisms of HPV Carcinogenesis**

Continuous expression of papillomavirus early genes may directly promote genetic abnormalities that often result in impaired function of genes that are critical for cell homeostasis. Furthermore, expression of high-risk HPV E6 and E7 genes in the basal cell layer induces chromosomal instability and aneuploidy.

Like E7, the E6 protein of HPV appears to contribute to cervical carcinogenesis through multiple activities. This protein is known to degrade p53 and other cellular targets through its interaction with the ubiquitin ligase E6AP.

**Clinical Significance**

To summarize, studies worldwide have consistently found HPV in 95 to 100 percent of cervical cancer cells, and in virtually all cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

Virtually all cases of cervical cancer are caused by persistent infection with certain oncogenic strains of HPV, a very common sexually transmitted virus.

## 8.3.3 Hepatitis Viruses

**Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)**

Biopsy material from patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma has been tested for the presence of HBV DNA. HBV DNA is integrated into the host genome, and isolation of restriction fragments larger than the HBV genome confirms HBV integration within the cell genome.

Globally, more than 260 million people are estimated to be chronic carriers of HBV, of whom 1–2% per year will progress to liver disease; more than 90% are unaware of their status.

**Prevention and Treatment**

Preventive vaccines against hepatitis B virus have been available since 1982, and direct-acting antiviral agents have the potential to cure more than 95% of people with hepatitis C virus infection.

## 8.3.4 Other Oncogenic Viruses

**Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)**

Volume 100 of the IARC Monographs identifies several human DNA and RNA viruses that are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1); these include various types of human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV-1.

**Immunosuppression and Viral Carcinogenesis**

Individuals who are latently infected with an oncogenic virus are at greatly increased risk for developing virus-related cancers when they become immunosuppressed.

The severe depletion of CD4-positive T lymphocytes induced by HIV-1 leads to dysregulated control of B lymphocytes and to the expression of co-infecting lymphotropic viruses.
