## 8.4.1 Helicobacter pylori and Gastric Cancer

**Epidemiology and Disease Associations**

Helicobacter pylori (chronic infection) is known to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans.

Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been performed of the worldwide prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, the main (necessary but not sufficient) risk factor for gastric cancer. The global prevalence in adults is close to 50%, with large differences between continents and a trend towards a decrease over the years.

**Mechanisms of H. pylori Carcinogenesis**

Mechanistically, H. pylori might cause gastric carcinomas by the converging effects of two main types of events: (i) collateral damage of inflammatory by-products causing mutational events in gastric epithelial cells and (ii) direct effects on gastric epithelial cells by H. pylori organisms or released bacterial products.

H. pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis is a slow process, typically developing over 4â€“6 decades, and accompanied by specific histological changes. The 'intestinal' subtype of gastric adenocarcinoma develops through a preneoplastic sequence from chronic superficial gastritis through atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia.

**Inflammatory Response**

The intense gastric inflammatory infiltrate (gastritis) that accompanies gastric colonization by H. pylori in humans can generate potentially genotoxic reactive oxygen and nitrogen species from the inflammatory cells themselves, and from adjacent gastric epithelial cells.

H. pylori also initiates changes in the characteristics of stomach epithelial cells (known as the "epithelial to mesenchymal transition") that enable the cells to proliferate as cancer cells do.

**Virulence Factors**

Virulence factors in H. pylori strains vary geographically, which may help to explain geographical patterns of stomach cancer risk. As discussed above, cancer risks are higher for CagA-positive H. pylori infection than for CagA-negative infection.

These biological effects (chronic inflammation, changes in gene expression, mutations, genomic instability, and cellular proliferation) are associated with carcinogenesis. Some of these biological effects vary depending on virulence factors, the production of which can differ among H. pylori strains.

**Animal Models**

Recently, evidence that H. pylori infection may induce gastric adenocarcinomas in animal models has accumulated. Mongolian gerbils with long-term infection with H. pylori developed gastric cancer, with treatment with low-dose chemical carcinogens, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) or MNNG, or without them.

H. pylori infection (with bacteria orally administered by gavage) caused malignant tumors in two different types of stomach tissue in rodents, providing sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity.

## 8.4.2 Prevention and Treatment

**Eradication Therapy**

Randomized controlled trials (clinical studies with control groups that receive placebos) have shown that screening and treatment of H. pylori reduces stomach-cancer risk by approximately 35%.

In 16 intervention studies (non-controlled), eradication of H. pylori infection in gastric MALT lymphoma patients resulted in high rates (62% to 100%) of complete remission of the cancer.

**Risk Assessment**

In the pooled analysis, the risk of stomach cancer was highest in studies that followed the infected subjects for at least 10 years (in whom the risk was increased by a factor of nearly 6).

## 8.4.3 The Microbiome and Cancer

Helicobacter pylori is the best-understood model bacterium with a causal role in infection-related cancer, and the only one that has been classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) by the IARC Monographs.

Research on Helicobacter has unveiled many of the key molecular mechanisms by which bacteria persistently colonize host tissues and create a pro-oncogenic milieu. Many of these might be generalizable to other cancer-associated pathogens.
