Cancer is fundamentally characterized by continual unregulated proliferation of cancer cells. Rather than responding appropriately to the signals that control normal cell behavior, cancer cells grow and divide in an uncontrolled manner, invading normal tissues and organs and eventually spreading throughout the body. The development of cancer is now understood to be a complex multistep process involving the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations over time.

More than 90% of cancers are directly attributable to environmental and lifestyle factors, making them largely preventable. Understanding the etiology of cancer is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies and improving patient outcomes.
