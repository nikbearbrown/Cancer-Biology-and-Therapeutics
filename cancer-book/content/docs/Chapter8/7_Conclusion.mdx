The etiology of cancer is complex and multifactorial, involving the interplay of chemical, physical, and biological agents with host factors. The development of a cancer generally requires many steps, each governed by multiple factorsâ€”some dependent on the genetic constitution of the individual, others dependent on his or her environment and way of life.

Understanding these mechanisms has led to significant advances in cancer prevention and treatment. The identification of specific carcinogens has enabled the development of targeted prevention strategies, from vaccination against oncogenic viruses to the elimination of chemical exposures. As our knowledge continues to expand, particularly in areas such as the microbiome and epigenetic modifications, new opportunities for cancer prevention and therapy will undoubtedly emerge.

The key to reducing the global burden of cancer lies in continued research into carcinogenic mechanisms, implementation of evidence-based prevention strategies, and addressing the social and environmental determinants that contribute to cancer risk disparities worldwide.
