## 8.5.1 The Hallmarks of Cancer

Currently, the most widely accepted theory is the multistep theory, which explains the genetic and epigenetic events involved in transforming a single cell into numerous malignant cells capable of metastasis. Moreover, identifying cancer hallmarks has redefined the understanding of carcinogenesis, providing a more comprehensive view of cancer as a process driven by the accumulation of these hallmarks.

Two enabling characteristics facilitate the acquisition of these traits: genomic instability and tumor-promoting inflammation. Additionally, deregulated tumor metabolism has emerged as a defining feature of cancer cells.

## 8.5.2 Co-factors and Risk Modifiers

**Hormones and Promotion**

Hormones, particularly estrogens, are important as tumor promoters in the development of some human cancers. The proliferation of cells of the uterine endometrium, for example, is stimulated by estrogen, and exposure to excess estrogen significantly increases the likelihood that a woman will develop endometrial cancer.

**Environmental Co-factors**

HPV infections are maintained significantly longer and are less likely to clear in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Both Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) and the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, two common STIs, both may enhance the oncogenic potential of HPV.

## 8.5.3 Prevention Strategies

**Primary Prevention**

The barriers to HPV vaccination are greatest in those countries with the weakest health systems and the highest burden of HPV-associated disease. To maintain HPV vaccination as a key element of cancer control programmes globally, and to introduce it in other settings, will require major international commitment and funding.

**Secondary Prevention**

Eradication of H. pylori has proven to be an effective strategy for the prevention of gastric cancer. However, studies of more complex microbial communities have had difficulties to precisely pinpoint cancer-associated bacterial strains and metabolic processes and to establish their carcinogenic effects.
