The cell cycle control system represents one of the most fundamental regulatory networks in biology. Each of the different cyclin-Cdk complexes serves as a molecular switch that triggers a specific cell-cycle event. We now consider how these switches initiate such events and how the cell-cycle control system ensures that the switches fire in the correct order and only once per cell cycle.

The variety of ways in which the machinery of cell-cycle control can be altered in cancer illustrates two important points. First, it explains why individual cases of a particular cancer showing the same symptoms may arise from different mutations: in many cases several alternative mutations will have much the same effect on cell proliferation. Second, it reinforces the point that there is no fundamental difference in the processes that are affected by oncogenes—which become activated by mutation—and those affected by tumor suppressor genes—which become inactivated.

The intricate balance between positive and negative regulators of cell cycle progression ensures that cell division occurs only when appropriate. Disruption of this balance through mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leads to the uncontrolled proliferation characteristic of cancer. Understanding these mechanisms continues to provide new opportunities for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

As our knowledge of cell cycle control mechanisms expands, particularly regarding the molecular details of checkpoint signaling and the role of epigenetic modifications, new therapeutic targets and strategies will undoubtedly emerge. The challenge lies in translating this fundamental understanding into effective clinical interventions that can selectively target cancer cells while preserving normal cellular function.
