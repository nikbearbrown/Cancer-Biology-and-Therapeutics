title: 9.2 Cell Cycle Checkpoints

## 9.2.1 The Concept of Cell Cycle Checkpoints

Although most checkpoints are not essential for normal cell-cycle progression under ideal conditions, populations of cells with checkpoint defects often accumulate mutations due to occasional malfunctions in DNA replication, DNA repair, or spindle assembly. Some of these mutations can promote the development of cancer.

The restriction point could be considered as a prototype of cell cycle checkpoints. The restriction point is related to mitogen deprivation. Checkpoints are mostly related to DNA damage and mitotic progression.

## 9.2.2 The Restriction Point

Production of two cells from one requires duplication of all molecules and organelles that compose each cell. DNA does not duplicate throughout the cycle but only during several hours in S-phase. During S-phase, the DNAs of the 100,000 genes located on 23 pairs (in humans) of chromosomes are replicated, each in a timely fashion.

As discussed, the restriction "point" lies between the accumulation of cyclins D and E and the activation of cyclin E-CDK2. What is the topological relationship of this GF-dependent restriction point and DNA damage-induced G1 checkpoint? DNA damage targets CDKs by two mechanisms. First is rapid and transient disappearance of cyclin D1. DNA damage-induced pathways target cyclin D and then cyclin E-CDK2.

**Molecular Control of the Restriction Point**

Complexes of Cdk4 and Cdk6 with the D-type cyclins (cyclin D1, D2, and D3) play a critical role in progression through the restriction point in G1. Cyclin E is expressed later in G1, and Cdk2/cyclin E complexes are required for the G1 to S transition and initiation of DNA synthesis.

Cdk4, 6/cyclin D complexes then act to drive cells through the restriction point in G1. A key substrate of Cdk4, 6/cyclin D complexes is the tumor suppressor protein Rb, which regulates transcription of genes required for cell cycle progression.

## 9.2.3 DNA Damage Checkpoints

Following DNA damage, a cell undergoes growth arrest to repair DNA. Damaged DNA can propagate during S-phase and mitosis. Therefore, arrest occurs in G1 (before S) and in G2 (before mitosis). Arrest in G1 prevents aberrant replication of damaged DNA, and arrest in G2 allows cells to avoid segregation of defective chromosomes.

**DNA Damage Response Pathways**

Additionally, cancer may also form from a lack of control during DNA sequence breaks. When DNA is damaged, and double-stranded breaks occur, most commonly from UV stress; ATM and ATR proteins can stop cell division until the strand is repaired.

ATM, the product of the gene mutated in the chromosome fragility syndrome ataxia telangiectasia, phosphorylates FANCD2 at serine 222 in response to ionising radiation and activates G1-S checkpoint control. The ATM gene encodes for a protein kinase triggered by ionising radiation that phosphorylates a number of downstream targets such as the tumour suppressor gene p53, the Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) protein NBS1, CHK2 and BRCA1, all of which are involved in the S-phase checkpoint activated by ionising radiation.

## 9.2.4 The G2/M Checkpoint

A different molecular mechanism is used to control cell cycle progression through the G2 checkpoint, which prevents entry into mitosis in the presence of unreplicated or damaged DNA. Arrest of the cell cycle at this checkpoint is mediated by a protein kinase called Chk1, which is activated in response to DNA damage or incomplete replication. Chk1 phosphorylates the protein phosphatase Cdc25, thereby preventing Cdc25 from dephosphorylating and activating Cdc2.

**Mitotic Promoting Factor (MPF)**

Once DNA replication has taken place, initiation of a new S phase is prevented until the cell has passed through mitosis. MPF is the key molecule responsible for regulating the G2 to M transition in all eukaryotes. MPF is a dimer of cyclin B and the Cdc2 protein kinase.

If a cell is driven into mitosis before it has finished replicating its DNA, it will pass on broken or incomplete sets of chromosomes to its daughter cells. This disaster is avoided in most cells by a DNA replication checkpoint mechanism, which ensures that the initiation of mitosis cannot occur until the last nucleotide in the genome has been successfully replicated.
