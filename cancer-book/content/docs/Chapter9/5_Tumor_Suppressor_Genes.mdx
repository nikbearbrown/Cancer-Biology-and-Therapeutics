## 9.4.1 The p53 Tumor Suppressor

**p53 Function and Regulation**

The p53 gene like the Rb gene, is a tumor suppressor gene, i.e., its activity stops the formation of tumors. If a person inherits only one functional copy of the p53 gene from their parents, they are predisposed to cancer and usually develop several independent tumors in a variety of tissues in early adulthood. This condition is rare, and is known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a key role in the regulation of the cell cycle and cell death. The p53 protein is also involved in cell differentiation, DNA repair, senescence and angiogenesis. Wild-type (wt) p53 and intact signaling pathways are essential for the prevention of cancer, consistent with a high tumor incidence observed in p53 null mice and in p53-heterozygous Li-Fraumeni patients.

**p53 Pathway Mechanism**

In the cell, p53 protein binds DNA, which in turn stimulates another gene to produce a protein called p21 that interacts with a cell division-stimulating protein (cdk2). When p21 is complexed with cdk2 the cell cannot pass through to the next stage of cell division. Mutant p53 can no longer bind DNA in an effective way, and as a consequence the p21 protein is not made available to act as the 'stop signal' for cell division.

DNA damage leads to rapid induction of p53, which activates transcription of the Cdk inhibitor p21. The inhibitor p21 blocks cell cycle progression, both by acting as a general inhibitor of Cdk/cyclin complexes and by inhibiting DNA replication by binding to PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen).

**p53 Target Genes**

p53 activates transcription of a number of genes with roles in the control of the cell cycle, including WAF1/CIP1/p21 (which encodes a regulator of Cdk activity), GADD45 (a growth-arrest DNA damage-inducible gene), MDM2 (encoding a protein that is a known negative regulator of p53), and 14-3-3σ (a regulator of G2/M progression), as well as various genes that likely function in apoptosis, including BAX, NOXA, and PUMA.

The main tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in maintaining the cell cycle is p53, which is a transcription factor that plays a role in promoting growth arrest, DNA repair, and eventual apoptosis, or regulated death by the cell in damaging situations. Additionally, p53 also regulates the expression of many inhibitory proteins like p21, GADD45. These proteins can inhibit Cdc2, which is crucial for the cell to progress through mitosis or meiosis.

**p53 Regulation by MDM2**

The Mdm2-p53 interaction is obligatory for p53 degradation. Preventing this interaction is sufficient to protect p53 from degradation. Following various stress stimuli, such as γ-IR and UV, this interaction is interrupted. Phosphorylation of p53 on serine 20 (Ser-20), which resides within the Mdm2 binding domain, reduces the affinity of Mdm2 for p53, and enhances the stabilization of p53 in response to γ-IR and UV light.

## 9.4.2 The Retinoblastoma (Rb) Tumor Suppressor

**Rb Function in Cell Cycle Control**

Retinoblastoma (RB): RB gene, also called 'Governor of the Cell Cycle,' encodes the RB protein that, when hypophosphorylated, binds and inhibits E2F transcriptions factors. These transcription factors regulate genes that are essential for cells to pass from G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. Typical growth factor signaling causes RB hyperphosphorylation and inactivation, thus causing cell cycle progression.

The Rb gene encodes the Rb protein, which is a universal regulator of the cell cycle that is normally expressed in almost all the cells of the body. Because it acts as one of the main brakes on progress through the cell-division cycle, the loss of Rb can allow cells to enter the cell division cycle inappropriately.

**Rb and Cancer**

Although Rb was identified in a rare childhood cancer, it is also involved in some of the more common tumors of adults. In particular, studies of the cloned gene have established that Rb is lost or inactivated in many bladder, breast, and lung carcinomas. The significance of the Rb tumor suppressor gene thus extends beyond retinoblastoma, apparently contributing to development of a substantial fraction of more common human cancers.

In sporadic cases of retinoblastoma, both normal RB alleles must undergo a somatic mutation in the same cell. The probability of this is low, which explains why retinoblastoma is uncommon in the general population.
