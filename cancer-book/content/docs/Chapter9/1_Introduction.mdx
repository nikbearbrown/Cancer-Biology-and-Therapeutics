At the heart of the cell-cycle control system is a family of protein kinases known as cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). The activity of these kinases rises and falls as the cell progresses through the cycle. The oscillations lead directly to cyclical changes in the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins that initiate or regulate the major events of the cell cycleâ€”DNA replication, mitosis, and cytokinesis.

Most cells in the body go through a cycle of life in which their genetic information is retained, fixed, and passed down to daughter cells through a highly coordinated and regulated process. However, during this cell cycle, there are many situations where mistakes are made by the cycle or by a regulating system that causes the cell to proliferate uncontrollably, leading to cancer.

The precise control of cell cycle progression is essential for normal development, tissue homeostasis, and prevention of diseases such as cancer. This chapter examines the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell cycle progression and how their disruption contributes to cancer development.
