title: 9.5 Oncogenes and Cell Cycle Dysregulation

## 9.5.1 Proto-oncogenes and Oncogenes

Cancer-critical genes are grouped into two broad classes, according to whether the cancer risk arises from too much activity of the gene product, or too little. Genes of the first class, for which a gain-of-function mutation drives a cell toward cancer, are called proto-oncogenes; their mutant, overactive forms are called oncogenes.

The activation of oncogenes involves genetic changes to cellular protooncogenes. The consequence of these genetic alterations is to confer a growth advantage to the cell. Three genetic mechanisms activate oncogenes in human neoplasms: (1) mutation, (2) gene amplification, and (3) chromosome rearrangements.

Cancer may also arise from proto-oncogenic genes, which then mutate to become oncogenic or tumor-promoting genes.

## 9.5.2 Mechanisms of Oncogene Activation

**Gene Amplification**

Gene amplification refers to the expansion in copy number of a gene within the genome of a cell. Gene amplification was first discovered as a mechanism by which some tumor cell lines can acquire resistance to growth-inhibiting drugs. About 20% to 30% of breast and ovarian cancers show c-myc amplification, and an approximately equal frequency of c-myc amplification is found in some types of squamous cell carcinomas.

**Chromosomal Rearrangements and Mutations**

N-myc was discovered as a new member of the myc protooncogene family through its amplification in neuroblastomas. Amplification of N-myc correlates strongly with advanced tumor stage in neuroblastoma, suggesting a role for this gene in tumor progression. L-myc was discovered through its amplification in small-cell carcinoma of the lung, a neuroendocrine-derived tumor.

## 9.5.3 Growth Factor Signaling and Cell Cycle

Mitogens act to release the brakes on Cdk activity, thereby allowing S phase to begin. They do so by binding to cell-surface receptors to initiate a complex array of intracellular signals that penetrate deep into the cytoplasm and nucleus. The ultimate result is the activation of G1-Cdk and G1/S-Cdk complexes, which overcome the inhibitory barriers that normally block progression into S phase.

Growth factors stimulate animal cell proliferation by inducing synthesis of the D-type cyclins.

**Oncogenic Stress Response**

Surprisingly, however, when Ras or Myc is experimentally hyperactivated in most normal cells, the result is not excessive proliferation but the opposite: the activation of checkpoint mechanisms causes the cells to undergo either cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. The normal cell seems able to detect abnormal mitogenic stimulation, and it responds by preventing further division.
