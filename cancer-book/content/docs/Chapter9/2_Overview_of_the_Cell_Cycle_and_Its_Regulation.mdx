## 9.1.1 Cell Cycle Phases

Eukaryotic cell cycles are divided into four discrete phases: M, G1, S, and G2. M phase consists of mitosis, which is usually followed by cytokinesis. S phase is the period of DNA replication.

Somatic cells are the best know for this cell cycle and go through 2 main phases called interphase and mitosis. After mitosis, where the cells divide into 2 cells, they enter into the G1 phase, which is a place for resting and a checkpoint for complete genetic function before the cells can start replicating the DNA. This DNA replication occurs in the S phase of interphase and plays a crucial role in creating sister chromatids that can then separate later in the cycle. After the S phase, the cell then again enters into a resting state known as G2 before continuing on to complete the cell cycle with mitosis.

Most cells in our body are in G0, but the molecular basis and reversibility of this state vary in different cell types. Neurons and skeletal muscle cells, for example, are in a terminally differentiated G0 state, in which their cell-cycle control system is completely dismantled: the expression of the genes encoding various Cdks and cyclins are permanently turned off, and cell division never occurs.

## 9.1.2 Core Components of Cell Cycle Control

**Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs)**

Cyclical changes in Cdk activity are controlled by a complex array of enzymes and other proteins. The most important of these Cdk regulators are proteins known as cyclins. Cdks, as their name implies, are dependent on cyclins for their activity: unless they are tightly bound to a cyclin, they have no protein kinase activity.

Cyclins and Cyclin-dependent kinases, also known as CDK's, are the 2 major proteins that play a role in regulating the cell cycle. These CDK's are created throughout the cell cycle and are used to phosphorylate downstream proteins essential for healthy cell growth. On the other hand, cyclin is only created during specific times of the cell cycle and acts as a regulator.

**Cyclin Classification**

There are four classes of cyclins, each defined by the stage of the cell cycle at which they bind Cdks and function. Three of these classes are required in all eucaryotic cells: G1/S-cyclins bind Cdks at the end of G1 and commit the cell to DNA replication. S-cyclins bind Cdks during S phase and are required for the initiation of DNA replication. M-cyclins promote the events of mitosis. In most cells, a fourth class of cyclins, the G1-cyclins, helps promote passage through Start or the restriction point in late G1.

**Cell Cycle Progression Overview**

An ordered sequence of cyclin-Cdk activities triggers most of the events of the cell cycle. During G1 phase, Cdk activity is reduced to a minimum by Cdk inhibitors (CKIs), cyclin proteolysis, and decreased cyclin gene transcription. When environmental conditions are favorable, G1- and G1/S-Cdks increase in concentration, overcoming these inhibitory barriers in late G1 and triggering the activation of S-Cdk.
