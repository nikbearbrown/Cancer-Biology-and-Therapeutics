## 9.6.1 Common Alterations in Cancer

When either of these proteins is not functioning correctly, downstream elements are not properly functioning, such as the INK4a/ARF, which encodes for tumor suppressor proteins. However, tumors may grow, leading to cancer in these specific cells. Overexpression of growth factors or a lack of suppressor proteins can lead to rapid uncontrolled cell division.

Loss of p53 prevents this damage-induced cell cycle arrest, leading to increased mutation frequencies and a general instability of the cell genome. Such genetic instability is a common property of cancer cells, and it may contribute to further alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes during tumor progression.

**p53 Mutations in Cancer**

It is estimated that approximately one half of human cancers contain a mutation in p53. It is predicted that in the majority of the remaining tumors, the p53 signaling pathway is inactivated by up-regulation of p53 inhibitors, such as Mdm2, or by down-regulation of p53 cooperators, such as ARF.

In total, mutations of p53 may play a role in up to 50% of all cancers, making it the most common target of genetic alterations in human malignancies.

## 9.6.2 Viral Oncoproteins and Cell Cycle Control

In addition, as noted earlier in this chapter, the Rb protein is a key target for the oncogene proteins of several DNA tumor viruses, including SV40, adenoviruses, and human papillomaviruses, which bind to Rb and inhibit its activity. Transformation by these viruses thus results, at least in part, from inactivation of Rb at the protein level rather than from mutational inactivation of the Rb gene.

DNA viruses such as papillomaviruses can promote the development of cancer by sequestering the products of tumor suppressor genesâ€”in particular, the Rb protein, which regulates cell division, and the p53 protein, which is thought to act as an emergency brake on cell division in cells that have suffered genetic damage and to call a halt to cell division in senescent cells with shortened telomeres.

In papillomaviruses, the viral genes that are mainly to blame are called E6 and E7. The products of these viral oncogenes interact with many host cell proteins, but in particular they bind to the protein products of two key tumor suppressor genes of the host cell, putting them out of action and so permitting the cell to replicate its DNA and divide in an uncontrolled way.

## 9.6.3 Multistep Carcinogenesis

From genetic analysis of those samples, they concluded that mutational activation of oncogenes and mutational inactivation of tumor suppressor genes drive progression. Fewer genetic changes in key oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes lead to benign tumors; more changes lead to aggressive cancers. The mutations tend to happen in a certain order, but much variability occurs. Five or so key mutations seem to be involved in progression.

Chronic exposures to carcinogens, accumulation of mutations, development of the mutator phenotype, and clonal selection during several decades result in cancer. Although the phenotypic traits of individual cancers are highly variable, commonly acquired capabilities include limitless replicative potential, self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth signals, evading apoptosis, tissue invasion, sustained angiogenesis, and metastasis.

## 9.6.4 Consequences of Cell Cycle Disruption

**Genomic Instability**

Loss of p53 function leads to genomic instability, abnormal centrosome duplication, and formation of aneuploid and polyploid cells. This suggests that p53 plays a role in the control of centrosome duplication and normal chromosomal segregation.

**Unlimited Proliferative Potential**

As cells proliferate without regulation, tumors occur that can become deadly if not treated. Mitosis occurs infinitely. The cells never die in cancer, as cancer cells can utilize telomerase to add many telomeric sections to the ends of DNA during DNA replication, allowing the cells to live much longer than other somatic cells.
