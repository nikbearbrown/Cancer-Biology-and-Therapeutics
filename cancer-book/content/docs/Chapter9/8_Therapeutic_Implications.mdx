## 9.7.1 Targeting Cell Cycle Checkpoints

Furthermore, and of particular interest with regard to cancer treatment, are data from models suggesting that some tumor cells lacking p53 function are less sensitive to Î³-irradiation and some chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin. Nevertheless, studies of other tumor cells suggest that p53 status shows a very different relationship to chemotherapeutic response, with cells that lack functional p53 being markedly sensitive to DNA-damaging agents but resistant to 5-fluorouracil.

## 9.7.2 CDK Inhibitors as Cancer Therapeutics

Control of Cdk inhibitors thus provides an additional mechanism for regulating Cdk activity. The combined effects of these multiple modes of Cdk regulation are responsible for controlling cell cycle progression in response both to checkpoint controls and to the variety of extracellular stimuli that regulate cell proliferation.

Understanding the mechanisms of cell cycle control and their disruption in cancer provides important insights for developing targeted cancer therapies. The identification of specific vulnerabilities in cancer cells with defective checkpoints offers opportunities for selective therapeutic intervention.
