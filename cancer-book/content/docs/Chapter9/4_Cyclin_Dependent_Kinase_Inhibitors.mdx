## 9.3.1 Families of CDK Inhibitors

In mammalian cells, two families of Cdk inhibitors are responsible for regulating different Cdk/cyclin complexes. Members of the Cip/Kip family regulate all stages of progression through G1 and S phase by inhibiting complexes of Cdk2, 4, and 6 with cyclins A, D, and E. In contrast, members of the Ink4 family are specific for complexes of Cdk4 and 6 with cyclin D, so the Ink4 CKIs only regulate progression through the restriction point in G1.

**Anti-proliferative Signaling**

The best-characterized extracellular inhibitor of animal cell proliferation is TGF-β—a polypeptide factor that inhibits the proliferation of a variety of types of epithelial cells by arresting cell cycle progression in G1. This action of TGF-β appears to be mediated by induction of the Cdk inhibitor p15, which binds to Cdk4, 6/cyclin D complexes. In the resulting absence of Cdk4 activity, Rb phosphorylation is blocked and the cell cycle is arrested in G1.

In addition to p21, p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b), which are pure inhibitors of cyclin D-CDK-4 and -6, are induced through the MAPK pathway. This pathway is involved in p21 and p15 induction by TGF-β. Like contact inhibition, TGF-β can arrest the cell cycle in G1 by inducing p27.
