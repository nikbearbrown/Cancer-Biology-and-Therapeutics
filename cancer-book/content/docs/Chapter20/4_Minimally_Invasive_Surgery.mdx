title: 20.3 Minimally Invasive Surgery
---



The development of minimally invasive surgical techniques has revolutionized cancer surgery by reducing morbidity while maintaining oncologic outcomes.

## 20.3.1 Principles of Minimally Invasive Surgery

**Definition:**
Minimally invasive (MI) surgery has been described as a discipline that involves a novel way to perform operative procedures with the main goal of decreasing the sequelae of traditional surgery.

**Benefits:**
The primary reasons for adopting this minimally invasive technique are to reduce surgical trauma, facilitate quicker postoperative recovery, and lower the risk of surgical wounds and other hospital-acquired infections.

**Implementation:**
Such procedures can now be frequently performed on an outpatient basis by using minimally invasive technology such as laparoscopic surgical approaches.

## 20.3.2 Laparoscopic Oncology

### Colorectal Applications

**Clinical Evidence:**
In earlier trials, there was no difference in outcome, staging, number of lymph nodes resected, and survival between open versus laparoscopic colectomy. In a prospective randomized single-institution study, at a median followup of 43 months, investigators reported an improved cancer-related survival in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.

**Technical Considerations:**
The principles of surgical management of both colon and rectal adenocarcinoma are basically the same whether performed open or laparoscopically. However, the surgical management for colon and rectal cancer require special considerations for each approach.

### Gynecologic Applications

**Endometrial Cancer:**
Twenty-two studies involving a total of 4420 patients showed that robotic surgery is generally safer and more reliable than laparoscopy and laparotomy for patients with endometrial cancer. The estimated blood loss and number of conversions were significantly lower in robotic surgery than in laparoscopy.

**Ovarian Cancer:**
Comparison of efficacy of robotic surgery, laparoscopy, and laparotomy in the treatment of ovarian cancer showed varying results depending on the specific outcomes measured, with each approach having distinct advantages.

## 20.3.3 Robotic Surgery

### Technical Advantages

**Enhanced Precision:**
Robotic surgery provides several potential advantages including enhanced dexterity, improved visualization, and reduced surgeon fatigue. The robotic approach may be particularly beneficial for complex reconstructive procedures.

**Learning Curve:**
The definition of the robotic approach was heterogeneous since the technique was defined as robotic, robotic-assisted, robot-assisted laparoscopic, combining sequentially different approaches.

### Clinical Outcomes

**Pancreatic Surgery:**
A systematic review on robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy showed increasing utilization over time. The overall procedure failure (rates of conversion to open surgery) was 14%. The overall morbidity rate was 58% and the reoperation rate was 7.3%.

**Comparative Effectiveness:**
Robotic surgery is associated with significantly lower estimated blood loss than both laparoscopy and laparotomy; fewer conversions but more complications than laparoscopy; and shorter length of hospital stay, fewer complications, and fewer transfusions but a longer operative time than laparotomy.

## 20.3.4 Specialized Minimally Invasive Techniques

### Transanal Microsurgery

**Applications:**
Rectal microsurgery is a form of minimally invasive surgery used in the treatment of early rectal cancers, defined as an adenocarcinoma invading the rectal wall up to the submucosa. For malignant lesions, local excision using transanal microsurgery is accepted for T1N0 rectal cancers.

**Advantages:**
Transanal microsurgery offers an oncologic cure without compromising bowel function. This technique addresses the limitations of traditional transanal excision by providing better exposure and visibility.

### Image-Guided Procedures

**Biopsy Techniques:**
Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are all useful techniques for localizing lesions at the time of invasive biopsy. However, while image-directed needle biopsy may be useful in some patients, exploratory surgery is often required to obtain a definitive biopsy.

**Intraoperative Navigation:**
The surgical treatment of breast cancer requires precise localization. Non-radioactive devices include the SCOUT RADAR device, MAGSEED, and RFIL, which allow for deployment up to thirty days before surgery.
