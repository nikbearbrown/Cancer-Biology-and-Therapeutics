title: 20.1 Principles of Cancer Surgery
---



The principles underlying cancer surgery have evolved significantly over the past century, transitioning from radical ablative procedures to more conservative, function-preserving approaches while maintaining oncologic effectiveness.

## 20.1.1 Historical Evolution and Current Philosophy

**Historical Perspective:**
Over the years, the practice of surgical oncology has come full circle. Originally, surgeons attempted to treat cancer conservatively by removing only the gross lesion. Unfortunately, this led to extremely high rates of local recurrence and subsequent patient mortality. In the late nineteenth century, surgeons began to undertake complete en bloc resections and amputations to treat patients with malignant lesions. These techniques yielded improved results, but the procedures were ablative and mutilating.

**Modern Conservative Approach:**
With the advent of complementary and effective treatment modalities, notably radiation therapy in the 1920s and chemotherapy after the 1940s, the orientation of surgical resection is once again becoming conservative. Adjuvant chemotherapy, alone or in combination with radiation therapy, has improved disease-free survival and prolonged quality life for patients who have been rendered free of gross disease by surgery.

**Contemporary Role:**
Surgery is the oldest modality of cancer therapy and still forms the mainstay of treatment in solid tumors. It remains a paradigm that more patients are cured by surgery when it is used as a single treatment in comparison with any other individual form of cancer therapy.

## 20.1.2 Fundamental Principles of Surgical Oncology

### Tissue Diagnosis Priority

**Essential Requirement:**
Surgical pathologists have the definitive role in tumor diagnosis. No matter how high the index of clinical suspicion, the diagnosis of cancer is not conclusively established nor safely assumed in the absence of a tissue diagnosis. With very few exceptions, definitive therapy for cancer should not be undertaken in the absence of a tissue diagnosis.

**Biopsy Considerations:**
The therapeutic approach in surgical mechanics is based on several principles: all lesions suspected to be neoplastic will be histologically examined. The pathologic interpretation of the tumor mass, regardless of the method used for biopsy, will provide essential information for treatment planning.

### En Bloc Resection Principles

**Anatomical Considerations:**
Surgery is most effective in the treatment of localized primary tumor and associated regional lymphatics. This is accomplished by en bloc surgical procedures that attempt to encompass gross and microscopic tumor in all contiguous and adjacent anatomic locations.

**Margin Assessment:**
The basic surgical principles are removal of the major vascular pedicle feeding the tumor along with its lymphatics, obtaining a tumor-free margin, and en bloc resection of any organs or structures attached to the tumor. Excision margins should be identified and marked with ink prior to any dissection, thus permitting accurate measurement of these distances microscopically.

### Multidisciplinary Integration

**Team Approach:**
To be maximally effective, the cancer surgeon must function as a member of the oncology team, and is frequently the first oncology specialist that a patient will consult. Because surgery is increasingly combined with other treatment modalities, it is essential that most patients with solid neoplasms have their treatment planned by a multidisciplinary team.

**Coordinated Care:**
The successful surgical oncologist must be able to coordinate and integrate the efforts of the entire oncologic team if the oncologist is to retain a primary role in the management of the cancer patient.

## 20.1.3 Role of the Surgical Oncologist

### Scope of Practice

**Comprehensive Expertise:**
Surgical oncologists are surgeons who devote most of their time to the study and treatment of malignant neoplastic disease. They must possess the necessary knowledge, skills, and clinical experience to perform both the standard as well as extraordinary surgical procedures required for patients with cancer.

**Diagnostic Responsibilities:**
The cancer surgeon is commonly charged with the responsibility to establish a tissue diagnosis for a suspicious lesion, where it will be the surgeon's decision whether an operative procedure is needed versus an image-directed or other biopsy approach.

**Multidisciplinary Knowledge:**
Surgical oncologists must be able to diagnose tumors accurately and to differentiate aggressive neoplastic lesions from benign reactive processes. In addition, surgical oncologists should have a firm understanding of radiation oncology, medical oncology, and hematology.

### Leadership Role

**Primary Care Function:**
Surgical oncologists have a shared role with medical oncologists as the "primary care physicians" of cancer treatment. The cancer surgeon will usually bear the responsibility for communicating the biopsy findings to the patient, completing the procedures needed to stage the patient's disease, and planning and executing the definitive surgical treatment.

**Educational Role:**
As part of the larger surgical community, the surgical oncologist is a critical conduit of cancer information to colleagues in general surgery and other surgical specialties. Because of their leading role in the initial diagnosis of cancer, surgical oncologists are also frequently in leadership roles in cancer prevention and screening programs.

## 20.1.4 Quality and Safety Considerations

### Surgical Standards

**Quality Metrics:**
Wide variations exist globally in the quality and safety of surgical care. Quality issues are particularly concerning in the context of surgical treatment for cancer, where achieving adequate resection is fundamental to the success of the procedure.

**Incomplete Resection Impact:**
Inadequate surgical resection of tumors can significantly undermine the effectiveness of these procedures. Incomplete or inadequate breast cancer resection following lumpectomy or mastectomy has been reported at rates as high as 15â€“45 percent in some settings.

### Risk Assessment

**Patient Selection:**
The mechanics of surgical intervention influences the cancer recovery rate much less than other factors, such as the tumor type, location, growth type, biological behavior, as well as the patient's general condition.

**Perioperative Considerations:**
Because of their high-risk nature, decisions about the indications for palliative surgical procedures are particularly difficult. For example, palliative surgery in the contexts of florid metastatic disease has a 20% to 30% perioperative mortality.
