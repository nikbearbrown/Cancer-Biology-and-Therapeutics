title: 20.4 Reconstructive Surgery
---



Reconstructive surgery plays an increasingly important role in cancer care, allowing for restoration of form and function while maintaining oncologic principles.

## 20.4.1 Principles of Oncoplastic Surgery

**Integration with Cancer Treatment:**
The role of reconstructive surgery as a part of the multimodality care of the oncology patient has become increasingly important. During the operation, enhanced awareness of tumor extent may indicate that an alteration is needed in the initial operative plan.

**Timing Considerations:**
Surgical treatment may occur after pretreatment with systemic agents (neoadjuvant) or as part of reconstruction (oncoplastic resection). Primary reconstruction of the breast is often performed at the time of mastectomy.

## 20.4.2 Breast Reconstruction

### Immediate vs. Delayed Reconstruction

**Immediate Reconstruction:**
Primary reconstruction of the breast is often performed at the time of mastectomy. The specific treatment regimens for breast cancer are currently directed by multidisciplinary teams involving integration of surgical oncologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, plastic surgeons, and rehabilitation specialists.

**Patient Selection:**
In younger patients with stage I and low-grade ovarian cancers who desire fertility-sparing surgery, surgical staging with uterine preservation may be considered, highlighting the importance of individualized approaches to reconstruction.

### Reconstructive Techniques

**Autologous Reconstruction:**
Various techniques are available for breast reconstruction using the patient's own tissue, providing natural results but requiring more extensive surgery.

**Implant-Based Reconstruction:**
Prosthetic reconstruction offers a less invasive option but may require multiple stages and has different considerations for patients receiving radiation therapy.

## 20.4.3 Head and Neck Reconstruction

**Complex Defects:**
Head and neck cancer surgery often results in significant functional and aesthetic deficits requiring sophisticated reconstructive techniques to restore speech, swallowing, and appearance.

**Microvascular Reconstruction:**
Free tissue transfer has revolutionized reconstruction of complex head and neck defects, allowing for restoration of both form and function.

## 20.4.4 Functional Restoration

### Lymphatic Reconstruction

**Lymphedema Prevention:**
For patients requiring lymph node dissection, lymphatic reconstruction procedures may be part of the initial operation (lymph-venous reconstruction), addressing the long-term complications of cancer treatment.

**Rehabilitation Integration:**
Post-surgical morbidity has become an increasing focus of concern as more patients survive breast cancer with modern therapy. Cancer rehabilitation can be broadly defined as the maximum restoration of physical, psychologic, social, vocational, recreational, and economic functions within the limits imposed by the malignancy and its treatment.

### Prosthetic Integration

**Limb Salvage:**
For example, breast-preserving surgery has become an alternative to mastectomy in patients with breast carcinoma; limb salvage is often possible in patients with bone and soft-tissue sarcomas; and sexual potency/urinary continence can frequently be preserved for patients with prostate cancer.

**Quality of Life Considerations:**
The prosthetic candidacy may be affected by numerous factors, including associated medical conditions, other physical disabilities, life expectancy, muscle strength and coordination, stamina, various psychological factors, and individual lifestyle factors.

## 20.4.5 Innovation in Reconstructive Techniques

### Advanced Materials

**Biocompatible Materials:**
Development of new prosthetic materials and techniques continues to improve outcomes for patients requiring reconstruction after cancer surgery.

**Tissue Engineering:**
Emerging technologies in tissue engineering offer promise for more natural reconstruction options in the future.

### Multidisciplinary Coordination

**Team Approach:**
The surgical treatment requires the contribution of a comprehensive interprofessional care team. Some surgeons also elect to have pathology verify margins intra-operatively, ensuring oncologic adequacy while planning reconstruction.

**Coordinated Care:**
A radiologist must be available in coordination with the surgeon's schedule to verify the specimen contains any biopsy clip, seed, or complete intact wire. This approach ensures the removal of the target lesion before the completion of surgery and reconstruction.
