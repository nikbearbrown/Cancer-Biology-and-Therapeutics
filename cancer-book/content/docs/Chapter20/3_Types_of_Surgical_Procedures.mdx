title: 20.2 Types of Surgical Procedures
---



Surgical procedures in oncology serve different therapeutic goals depending on the stage of disease, patient condition, and treatment intent. Understanding these various approaches is essential for appropriate surgical planning.

## 20.2.1 Curative Resection

**Definition and Goals:**
Curative resection can only be used in the case of the absence of metastases, and the tumor is circumscribed, with the possibility of total excision. Surgery is more effective, less complex, and less costly when performed for early-stage or locally advanced cancer.

**Technical Principles:**
For right-sided tumors, the basic surgical principles include obtaining a tumor-free margin of at least 5 cm of normal bowel on either side of the tumor to minimize the possibility of an anastomotic recurrence. En bloc removal of involved structures may offer the only chance for cure.

**Lymph Node Management:**
The routine dissection of regional nodes in close proximity to the primary malignancy is recommended for most cancer types even when these structures are not clinically involved with tumor. At the present time, it is generally agreed that en bloc regional lymph node dissection is indicated for clinically demonstrable nodal involvement with metastatic tumor.

### Examples of Curative Procedures

**Breast Cancer Surgery:**
Multiple landmark studies published in the last several decades have led to the transition from more radical options, such as radical mastectomy, towards breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Surgery is an essential component in the management of treatable breast cancer... evidence-based management of breast cancer has evolved to limit treatments to what is necessary but sufficient to allow tissue preservation and control of treatment-specific morbidity.

**Colorectal Cancer Surgery:**
Radical surgery with curative intent is the treatment of choice in the majority of colon cancers. True colonic mucosal recurrences are rare. More common are para-anastomotic recurrences reflecting possibly an inadequate lymphadenectomy.

## 20.2.2 Debulking Surgery (Cytoreductive Surgery)

**Definition and Rationale:**
Cytoreductive surgery results in a reduction of tumor cell pressure, so that other simultaneous therapeutic methods can be more effective. Thus, surgery improves the efficacy of adjuvant therapy by the mechanical reduction in the number of cells that will be treated.

**Clinical Applications:**
Surgery for residual disease is a special application of palliative surgery. Cytoreductive surgery may be of benefit provided that (1) other forms of effective treatment are available for use after surgery, and (2) that reduction of tumor bulk will enhance the effectiveness of these other treatment modalities.

### Ovarian Cancer Cytoreduction

**Primary Debulking:**
Generally, surgical therapy is the initial treatment performed in most patients with epithelial ovarian cancer for histologic confirmation, staging, and tumor debulking, which will help guide adjunct treatments. The move towards extensive surgery has been coupled with a greater stringency as to what constitutes optimal cytoreduction; this is increasingly being defined as removal of all macroscopic disease.

**Interval Debulking Surgery:**
Interval debulking surgery (IDS) is usually performed after 2 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy so as to prevent the development of chemo-resistance. A number of studies have reported optimal cytoreduction rates comparable to best results achieved at primary surgery.

**Neoadjuvant Approach:**
Some patients with advanced-stage disease that is unlikely to be completely resected or unresectable may benefit from undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgical cytoreduction.

### Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Management

**HIPEC Procedures:**
Treatment should be multimodal and include preoperative systemic chemotherapy, complete cytoreductive surgery, and intraabdominal hyperthermia combined with intraoperative chemotherapy. The complete surgical cytoreduction possible is decisive for the prognosis, which requires multiple organ resections in addition to a partial to subtotal parietal peritonectomy.

**Selection Criteria:**
To quantify the extent of peritoneal metastases and determine the feasibility of tumor reduction, a surgical variable is used (index of peritoneal carcinomatosis: PCI). Depending on the pathologies, there is a threshold value beyond which the procedure does not improve survival.

## 20.2.3 Palliative Surgery

**Definition and Goals:**
Palliative surgery aims to treat and prevent symptoms, to prolong the patient's comfortable life. Palliative surgery can significantly enhance the quality of life and allow patients to return home for end-of-life care.

**Treatment Philosophy:**
Palliative treatment should be provided within delivery platforms as close to patients' homes as possible. It should be made clear that the procedure is being done to improve the quality of life, rather than to extend it.

### Common Palliative Procedures

**Obstruction Relief:**
Examples of indicated palliative surgical procedures include (1) colostomy, enteroenterostomy, or gastrojejunostomy to relieve obstruction... Palliative surgical procedures commonly required include mastectomy for bulky, fungating, or bleeding tumors and formation of a colostomy for obstructing colorectal tumors.

**Pain Management:**
Additional palliative procedures include (2) cordotomy to control pain; (4) amputation for intractably painful tumors of the extremities; (5) simple mastectomy for carcinoma of the breast, when the tumor is infected, large, ulcerated, and locally resectable, (even in the presence of distant metastases).

**Hemorrhage Control:**
Other procedures include (3) cystectomy to control hemorrhagic tumors of the bladder; (7) destruction of liver metastases by using radiofrequency ablation.

### Risk-Benefit Considerations

**Patient Selection:**
Advanced disease has higher operative and postoperative risks; the risks and benefits of the procedure must be weighed carefully by providers and patients. The risk:benefit ratio and ultimate surgical objectives must be defined as clearly as possible and accepted by patient, family, and surgeon.

**Quality vs. Quantity:**
In other situations, when recovery is unlikely, palliative surgery can bring improvements for a time period and/or the prolongation of life. The procedure of tumor fighting can be successfully applied to tumors with slow development and low metastatic rate.

## 20.2.4 Prophylactic Surgery

**Indications:**
Preventive surgery can be applied by the excision of the benign, premalignant or in situ tumor, which prevents the possible onset of invasive malignancy. The old adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure certainly applies in solid-tumor oncology.

**Genetic Considerations:**
As the role of genetic mutations that predispose to subsequent cancer development expands, one can anticipate that prophylactic surgery will be extended to encompass these conditions. It is imperative that the surgical oncologist become intimately knowledgeable about the indications, limitations, and ethical considerations regarding genetic counseling.

**Risk-Reducing Procedures:**
Preventive surgery can be performed by the removal of tissues or organs that can contribute to the possible appearance of neoplasms or present a higher predictable malignization rate than normal.
