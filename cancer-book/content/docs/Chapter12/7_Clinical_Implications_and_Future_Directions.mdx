## 12.7.1 Prognostic Significance

While multiple growth factors influence angiogenesis in glioma, none is more crucial to the process than VEGF. Glial cell lines vary in their production of VEGF, and tumorigenicity correlates with VEGF production. Furthermore, cell lines of low virulence can be converted to a more aggressive phenotype by transfection with VEGF.

## 12.7.2 Combination Therapies

Anti-VEGF treatments should block this therapy-induced resistance and VEGF-induced tumor cell survival, as well as inhibiting angiogenesis. Anti-VEGF treatments used in combination with conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy should dramatically improve treatment for cancer patients, with some initial studies already providing promising results.

Given its vital role in tumor angiogenesis, specific targeting of VEGF signaling has been one of the key avenues in developing anti-angiogenic therapies. One such strategy has employed the development and use of a VEGF neutralising antibody termed Bevacizumab (also known as Avastin). This therapy has been approved for use in a variety of cancer types, such as non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer.

## 12.7.3 Emerging Targets

In summary, anti-angiogenesis and anti-lymphangiogenesis therapies hold great potential in combating the ongoing problem of cancer metastasis and the poor survival rates associated with cancer spread. Research and development of drugs in this area have so far begun to yield positive results with therapies such as Bevacizumab being implemented in the treatment of several cancer types. However, resistance to these anti-angiogenic strategies are possible and thus further research into new and multi target inhibitors of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis is essential in the ongoing fight against cancer spread.
