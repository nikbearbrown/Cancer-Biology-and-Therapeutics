## 12.3.1 Hypoxia as an Angiogenic Stimulus

Sprouting angiogenesis is initiated in poorly perfused tissues when oxygen sensing mechanisms detect a level of hypoxia that demands the formation of new blood vessels to satisfy the metabolic requirements of parenchymal cells.

VEGF is up-regulated by hypoxia and is often elevated near areas of tumor necrosis. Hypoxia activates a hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)-binding sequence in the VEGF promoter, which leads to VEGF mRNA transcription and stability.

## 12.3.2 Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs)

Hypoxia triggers a unique gene transcription program (specific set of genes) through the activation of multiple transcriptional factors known as the hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs exists as a heterodimeric complex containing one of three α subunits (HIF-1α, HIF-2α, or HIF-3α) associated with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), also known as HIF 1β. Although the hypoxic response requires HIF multiple subunits to be functional, hypoxia only leads to changes in both the accumulation and the activity of the HIF-1α subunit.

Following the prolyl hydroxylase inhibition, HIF-1α is stabilized, accumulates in the cells, where it dimerizes with ARNT and translocates into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the HIF-1α/ARNT complex binds to the hypoxia responsive element (HRE) present in the promoter region of target genes as well as transcriptional co-activator (p300) and initiates the transactivation of HIF-responsive genes, including the glucose transporter Glut1 and angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Under normal physiological conditions, oxygen inhibits neovascularization by promoting the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) proteins. However, this degradation is suppressed in hypoxic environments, allowing HIF proteins to bind to VEGF DNA and enhance protein translation. This dysregulation makes hypoxia a powerful stimulus for angiogenesis.

## 12.3.3 HIF-Mediated Effects on Tumor Biology

Mutations within cancer cells upregulate angiogenic factors, leading to a disorganized and defective vascular network that further exacerbates intratumor hypoxia. Additionally, the rapid proliferation of tumor cells and blood vessels disrupts the basement membrane, increasing the risk of invasion and metastasis. Tumor hypoxia is associated with more aggressive malignant behavior and reduced survival across multiple cancer types.
