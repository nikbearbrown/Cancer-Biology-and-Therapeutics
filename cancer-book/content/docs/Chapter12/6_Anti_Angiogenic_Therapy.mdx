title: 12.6 Anti-Angiogenic Therapy
---


## 12.6.1 Therapeutic Rationale

Recognition that control of angiogenesis could have therapeutic value has stimulated great interest during the past 40 years. Stimulation of angiogenesis can be therapeutic in ischemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and wound healing. Decreasing or inhibiting angiogenesis can be therapeutic in cancer, ophthalmic conditions, rheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases.

Angiogenic therapies provide a potential to conquer cancer, heart diseases, and more than 70 of life's most threatening medical conditions. The lives of at least 1 billion people worldwide could be improved with angiogenic therapy, according to the Angiogenesis Foundation.

## 12.6.2 Bevacizumab: Clinical Implementation

Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). It is used to treat several different cancers (cervical cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal cancer, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma). The administration of bevacizumab inhibits microvascular growth and angiogenesis and is used in cancer treatment to inhibit malignant cell growth and blood vessel formation.

Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to all known vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) isoforms. It blocks the interaction between VEGF-A and the VEGF receptors (VEGFR), primarily VEGFR-1 (fit-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDRflk-1), on the surface of endothelial cells. The binding of VEGF-A to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 leads to endothelial cell proliferation, the activation of survival pathways, and the formation of new blood vessels and angiogenesis.

## 12.6.3 Clinical Efficacy of Anti-Angiogenic Therapy

This review found that addition of bevacizumab improved progression-free overall survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who received first- or second-line fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, but at the expense of increased incidence of toxicity.

The authors concluded that, compared with other targeted drugs, bevacizumab plus chemotherapy significantly improved response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival in the treatment of chemotherapy naive patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

## 12.6.4 Toxicities of Anti-Angiogenic Therapy

Ovarian failure: VEGFA is assumed to play an essential role in regulating angiogenesis in the ovary. The incidence of ovarian failure increases in premenopausal women given bevacizumab. Bevacizumab induces ovarian damage; it is likely that this damage is temporary and disappears within the expected drug clearance in most cases.

Congestive heart failure: Bevacizumab treatment significantly increases cancer patients' risk of developing CHF. In a meta-analysis, increased risks of developing CHF were observed in patients with breast cancer, renal cell cancer, and glioblastoma.

This review found that addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapeutic regimens significantly increased the risk of high-grade proteinuria in patients with cancer. Risk of high-grade proteinuria varied according to tumour type. There were statistically significant increases in risk of high-grade proteinuria with all malignancy types except malignant mesothelioma.

This review assessed the overall risk for venous thromboembolism in cancer patients associated with the use of bevacizumab. The authors concluded that the use of bevacizumab was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism in cancer patients receiving this drug.

## 12.6.5 Endogenous Angiogenesis Inhibitors

Endogenous specific inhibitors of endothelial proliferation and of angiogenesis include: angiostatin, a 38 kDa internal fragment of plasminogen (generated by Lewis lung carcinoma), endostatin, a 20 kDa internal fragment of collagen XVIII (generated from a murine hemangioendothelioma), a 53 kDa conformationally changed fragment of antithrombin III (generated from human small cell lung cancer), and tumstatin, a 28 kDa internal fragment of collagen IV (Î± 3NC1 domain). They do not inhibit proliferation of resting confluent endothelial cells, epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, or tumor cells in vitro.

In SCID mice bearing human pancreatic cancer, human recombinant endostatin was injected into the peritoneal cavity once daily, or delivered continuously by an implanted micro-osmotic pump that released 1 microliter/hour. Continuous dosing inhibited tumor growth 10-fold more effectively than once a day bolus dosing and also induced tumor regression, whereas bolus dosing did not.
