title: 12.2 Key Angiogenic Factors

## 12.2.1 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)

Most types of parenchymal cells (myocytes, hepatocytes, neurons, astrocytes, etc.) respond to a hypoxic environment by secreting a key proangiogenic growth factor called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). There does not appear to be redundant growth factor mechanisms that can replace the role of VEGF-A in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis.

### VEGF Structure and Isoforms

The VEGF family molecules include VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and placental growth factor (PlGF). The VEGF family of receptors consists of three protein-tyrosine kinases: VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1, Flt-1), VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2, Flk-1/KDR), VEGFR-3, and two non-protein kinase co-receptors: neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2, respectively.

VEGF-B is widely expressed, most prominently in heart and skeletal muscle, but also in mouse and human brain. The highest levels of VEGF-B in the brain are detected in neuronal-like cells of the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. VEGF-B is implicated in angiogenesis by its role in the regulation of extracellular matrix degradation, cell adhesion and migration of endothelial cells.

VEGF-C is a ligand for both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. VEGF-C mRNA is found in several tissues including heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine, although it is undetectable in the normal brain. As VEGFR-3 is the main receptor for VEGF-C and is predominantly expressed on lymphatic endothelium, VEGF-C was therefore considered to be the prototypic lymphangiogenic factor. However, VEGF-C has also been shown to act on vascular endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo.

The secreted PlGF shows a strong structural homology to VEGF and exists as three isoforms, PlGF-1, PlGF-2 and PlGF-3, which result from alternative splicing from a single gene locus. PlGF is predominantly expressed in placenta and binds exclusively to VEGFR-1. PlGF induces both proliferation and chemotaxis of endothelial cells in vitro and is angiogenic in vivo.

### VEGF Receptors and Signaling

The VEGF family and its receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) have long been implicated as a central figure in the regulation of angiogenesis. VEGF-A directly stimulates EC proliferation by engaging with the VEGFR-2 to activate tyrosine kinase and initiate the sprouting of new vessels from existing microvessels.

VEGF also diminishes the intensity of the endothelial cell–cell interactions in the angiogenic sprout by promoting the phosphorylation and internalization of VE-cadherin. The weakened cell–cell adhesion enables tip cells to depart from the endothelial lining and also accounts for the increased vascular permeability that is characteristic of proliferating blood vessels. While most of the angiogenic effects of VEGF are mediated through VEGFR-2, the hyperpermeability associated with this process requires the activation of both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2.

## 12.2.2 Angiopoietin-Tie System

### Tie Receptors and Angiopoietin Ligands

The tyrosine kinase receptor Tie2 was initially identified as a specific vascular growth factor that governed several properties of endothelial cells under both physiological and pathological conditions. It was subsequently found that angiopoietins, the natural ligands of Tie2, modulate Tie2-dependent signaling, which in turn regulates the survival and apoptosis of endothelial cells, controls vascular permeability, and regulates the capillary sprouting that occurs during normal angiogenesis such as through development and ovarian remodeling.

The most extensively studied Tie2 ligands are Angiopoietin 1 and 2 (Ang1, Ang2). Ang1 plays a critical role in vessel maturation, endothelial cell migration, and survival. Ang2, depending on the context, may function to disrupt connections between the endothelial cells and perivascular cells, promoting vascular regression. However, in the presence of VEGF-A, Ang2 instead promotes angiogenesis.

### Angiopoietin Functions in Angiogenesis

Angiopoietin (Ang) 1 is a ligand for endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine kinase Tie-2. In adult vasculature, Ang1/Tie2 signaling is thought to regulate both maintenance of vascular quiescence and promotion of angiogenesis. Ang1 assembles distinct Tie2 signaling complexes in either presence or absence of endothelial cell-cell adhesions. Ang1 induces trans-association of Tie2 at cell-cell contacts, whereas Tie2 is anchored to the extracellular matrix (ECM) by Ang1 at the cell-substratum interface.

Angiopoietin-2 (ANG2), a ligand of the TIE2 receptor, modulates endothelial cell biology and destabilizes blood vessels to facilitate angiogenesis. Recent reports have shown that ANG2 inhibition, for example, by monoclonal antibodies, peptibodies, or CovX-Bodies, may achieve substantial antiangiogenic and antitumor responses in a variety of mouse tumor models.

The angiopoietins Ang1 (ANGPT1) and Ang2 (ANGPT2) are secreted factors that bind to the endothelial cell-specific receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 (TEK) and regulate angiogenesis. Ang1 activates Tie2 to promote blood vessel maturation and stabilization. In contrast, Ang2, which is highly expressed by tumor-associated endothelium, can function as either an agonist or antagonist of Tie2 signaling, depending on the cellular context.

## 12.2.3 Other Angiogenic Factors

### Fibroblast Growth Factors

Systemic administration of IFN-α reduces tumor cell growth in IFN-sensitive cells by directly regulating the expression of the angiogenic protein basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). IFN-α and IFN-β also downregulate bFGF in other human carcinomas. Interruption of the angiogenic signal by IFNs precedes the antiproliferative effect and is detectable between 24 to 48 h after tumor inoculation.

### Placental Growth Factor

Transplantation of wild-type bone marrow rescued the impaired angiogenesis and collateral growth in PlGF −/− mice, indicating that PlGF might have contributed to vessel growth in the adult by mobilizing bone-marrow-derived cells. PlGF has been proposed to stimulate angiogenesis by displacing VEGF from the "VEGFR-1 sink," thereby increasing the fraction of VEGF available to activate VEGFR-2. Alternatively, PlGF might stimulate angiogenesis by transmitting intracellular signals through VEGFR-1.
