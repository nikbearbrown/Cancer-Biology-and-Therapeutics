## 12.4.1 Basic Steps of Angiogenesis

The basic steps of sprouting angiogenesis include enzymatic degradation of capillary basement membrane, endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, directed migration of ECs, tubulogenesis (EC tube formation), vessel fusion, vessel pruning, and pericyte stabilization.

ECs exposed to such stimuli first detach from each other through alterations in adherens junction complexes, and metalloproteinases are then released to degrade the underlying basement membrane and surrounding structural elements. Hence, the initiation of angiogenesis is often associated with an increased capillary permeability that serves to enrich the adjacent interstitial compartment with plasma components.

## 12.4.2 Endothelial Cell Sprouting

Upon destabilization of the endothelial cell monolayer, the cells then migrate (haptotaxis) toward the angiogenic stimulus within the extravascular space via integrin (αvβ3, αvβ5)-mediated adhesion to matrix proteins, with a concomitant proliferation. Sprouting requires the destabilization of existing microvessels, which includes pericyte dropout, diminished cell–cell adhesion, and dissolution of the basement membrane. This process begins with an endothelial ("tip") cell leaving the endothelial monolayer, penetrating the basement membrane, and invading the adjacent interstitial compartment.

## 12.4.3 Tip Cell and Stalk Cell Specification

The cellular actions of VEGF need to be coordinated to guide vascular patterning during sprouting angiogenesis. Individual endothelial tip cells lead and guide the blood vessel sprout, while neighbouring stalk cells proliferate and form the vascular lumen. Recent studies illustrate how endothelial DLL4/NOTCH signalling, stimulated by VEGF, regulates the sprouting response by limiting tip cell formation in the stalk.

Clearly both types of endothelial cells are stimulated by the same growth factor, VEGF, and both respond through KDR signaling, yet their behaviour is very different. One of the genes induced by VEGF is the NOTCH ligand DLL4. In situ hybridization suggested that Dll4 expression is restricted to developing arteries and the tips of vascular sprouts.

## 12.4.4 Types of Angiogenesis

Sprouting angiogenesis and intussusceptive angiogenesis both occur in utero and in adults. Sprouting angiogenesis is better understood having been discovered nearly 200 years ago: intussusceptive angiogenesis was discovered by Burri about two decades ago. As implied by its name, sprouting angiogenesis is characterized by sprouts composed of endothelial cells, which usually grow toward an angiogenic stimulus such as VEGF-A. Sprouting angiogenesis can therefore add blood vessels to portions of tissues previously devoid of blood vessels.

On the other hand, intussusceptive angiogenesis involves formation of blood vessels by a splitting process in which elements of interstitial tissues invade existing vessels, forming transvascular tissue pillars that expand. Both types of angiogenesis are thought to occur in virtually all tissues and organs.

Intussusceptive angiogenesis is also called splitting angiogenesis because the vessel wall extends into the lumen causing a single vessel to split in two. This type of angiogenesis is thought to be fast and efficient compared with sprouting angiogenesis because, initially, it only requires reorganization of existing endothelial cells and does not rely on immediate endothelial proliferation or migration.
