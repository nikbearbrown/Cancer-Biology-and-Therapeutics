Angiogenesis represents a critical process in cancer development and progression. The understanding of key molecular mechanisms, particularly involving VEGF and angiopoietin signaling pathways, has led to the development of targeted therapies that have shown clinical benefit in multiple cancer types. However, the complexity of angiogenic networks and the development of resistance mechanisms highlight the need for continued research into novel therapeutic approaches. The integration of anti-angiogenic therapy with conventional treatments continues to evolve, offering hope for improved patient outcomes while requiring careful management of associated toxicities.
