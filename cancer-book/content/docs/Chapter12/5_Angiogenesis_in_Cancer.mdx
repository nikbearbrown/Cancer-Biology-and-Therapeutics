## 12.5.1 Historical Perspective

In 1971, Folkman proposed a new view of the role of blood vessels in tumor growth in the form of a hypothesis that tumor growth is angiogenesis dependent. This hypothesis suggested that tumor cells and vascular endothelial cells within a neoplasm may constitute a highly integrated ecosystem and that endothelial cells may be switched from a resting state to a rapid growth phase by a "diffusible" chemical signal from tumor cells. An additional speculation was that angiogenesis could be a relevant target for tumor therapy (i.e., antiangiogenic therapy).

## 12.5.2 Evidence for Angiogenesis Dependence

Genetic evidence that tumors are angiogenesis dependent began to be reported by the mid-1990s and provides the most compelling proof that tumors and their metastases cannot not grow beyond a microscopic in situ size without recruiting their own blood supply.

A 50% reduction of VEGF-A expression is lethal embryonically because of vascular defects, and excess VEGF-A in tumors induces overproduction of tip cells leading to a disorganized vasculature. This critical dependence on physiological concentrations of VEGF-A for construction of viable blood vessels might help explain why attempts to induce angiogenesis in poorly perfused tissues with VEGF-A administration and gene therapy have not been highly successful.

## 12.5.3 Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Angiogenesis

Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells are involved in crucial processes during tumor development. A subset of monocytes that express the angiopoietin receptor Tie2 play an important role in tumor angiogenesis. Selective depletion of these Tie2-expressing monocytes (TEMs) in tumor-bearing mice inhibits tumor angiogenesis and growth, suggesting that they might regulate angiogenic processes in tumors by providing paracrine support to nascent blood vessels.

Tie2-expressing macrophages play a critical role in both tumor angiogenesis and the dissemination of tumor cells from the primary tumor to secondary sites. Therefore, Ang-Tie2 signaling functions as an angiogenic switch during tumor progression and metastasis.

## 12.5.4 Tumor Angiogenesis in Specific Cancer Types

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a major contributor to the growth of malignant tumors of the central nervous system. It stimulates tumor angiogenesis and vascular proliferation characteristic of high grade gliomas. Elevated expression of VEGF is one the factors responsible for the virulent nature of these tumors.

The progression to high grade is characterized by increased vascularity and the presence of endothelial cell proliferation. Swollen endothelial cells become prominent, and abnormal vascular channels resembling glomerular structures develop in the most undifferentiated lesions. Neoangiogenesis in human glioma is driven by multiple molecules including VEGF, angiopoietins, fibroblast growth factors, platelet derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factors.
