Angiogenesis, the growth of new capillary blood vessels, is central to the growth of cancer. An understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of tumor angiogenesis is therefore important for clinicians who diagnose and treat cancer by whatever modalities. Angiogenesis is the growth of blood vessels from the existing vasculature. It occurs throughout life in both health and disease, beginning in utero and continuing on through old age. No metabolically active tissue in the body is more than a few hundred micrometers from a blood capillary, which is formed by the process of angiogenesis.

## 12.1.1 The Angiogenic Switch

Consider a cancer cell that has progressed through a series of mutations so that by activation of certain oncogenes and by loss of specific suppressor genes, it has become self-sufficient in growth signals, insensitive to antigrowth signals, unresponsive to apoptotic signals, capable of limitless replicative potential, and tumorigenic. Are these neoplastic properties necessary and sufficient for such a cell to expand into a population that is clinically detectable, symptomatic, or lethal? Current evidence argues that these neoplastic properties may only be necessary but not sufficient for the cancer cell to become metastatic and lethal.

The reported studies suggest that the microvascular endothelial cell dictates to a cancer cell whether it can grow a tumor to a clinically detectable size, metastasize, or kill its host. For a tumor to develop a metastatic or a lethal phenotype, it must first recruit and sustain its own private blood supply, a process called tumor angiogenesis. Tumors unable to induce angiogenesis remain dormant at a microscopic in situ size.

## 12.1.2 Normal versus Pathological Angiogenesis

Angiogenesis is fundamental to reproduction, development, and repair. In the adult, repair and reproductive angiogenesis occur mainly as brief bursts of capillary blood vessel growth that usually last only days or weeks. Such physiologic angiogenesis, including neovascularization in exercised muscle, is tightly regulated.

Capillaries grow and regress in healthy tissues according to functional demands. Exercise stimulates angiogenesis in skeletal muscle and heart. A lack of exercise leads to capillary regression. Capillaries grow in adipose tissue during weight gain and regress during weight loss. Clearly, angiogenesis occurs throughout life.

A variety of circulating and sequestered inhibitors suppress proliferation of vascular endothelium under normal conditions. As a result, endothelial cells are among the most quiescent cells of the body. Turnover times of endothelial cells are measured in hundreds of days in contrast to bone marrow cells, which maintain an average turnover time of 5 days and proliferate at approximately 6 billion cell divisions per hour. During angiogenesis, microvascular endothelial cells can proliferate as rapidly as bone marrow cells.

A hallmark of pathologic angiogenesis is persistent growth of blood vessels (i.e., sustained neovascularization). Angiogenesis that continues for months or years supports the progression of many neoplastic and nonneoplastic diseases.

## 12.1.3 Tumor Size Limitations and the Angiogenic Switch

The size limits of experimental tumors when angiogenesis is blocked or absent are between approximately 0.2 mm diameter (e.g., for lung metastases in mice) and 2 mm (e.g., for vascular chondrosarcomas in rats, having a tumor population of 10⁵–10⁶ cells). The differences in size of avascular preangiogenic tumors may be due in part to the capacity of tumor cells to survive under differing degrees of hypoxia.

Angiogenesis is needed to support the growth of a tumor beyond the size of about a million cells, at which point new blood vessels are required to supply oxygen and nutrients to the proliferating tumor cells. Such blood vessels are formed in response to growth factors, secreted by the tumor cells, that stimulate proliferation of endothelial cells in the walls of capillaries.
