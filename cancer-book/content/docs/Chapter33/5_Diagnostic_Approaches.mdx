## 33.4.1 General Principles

**Tissue Diagnosis**:
A diagnosis of lymphoma is confirmed by tissue biopsy, and commonly used methods include fine-needle aspiration, core biopsy, incision/wedge biopsy, and excisional biopsy. Excisional biopsy is considered the "gold standard" as it allows for the assessment of whole lymph node architecture.

**Laboratory Evaluation**:
The differentiation of AML from other forms of leukemia, in particular chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, has vital therapeutic implications. The primary diagnostic tool in this determination is flow cytometry to evaluate surface antigens on the leukemia cells.

## 33.4.2 Specific Diagnostic Modalities

**Cytogenetics and Molecular Testing**:
Cytogenetics evaluation for Ph chromosome status and Ph-like translocation is a must as newer therapeutic agents are now incorporated into treatment algorithms. Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) has both myeloid and lymphoid markers but is a rare entity.

**Imaging Studies**:
Computed tomography (CT) is used to assess and stage the disease as it is commonly available. FDG PET/CT scan is considered to have superior sensitivity because of the FDG avidity in some T-cell lymphomas and helps in staging and treatment response assessment.

**Bone Marrow Examination**:
Bone marrow biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis, but if done, it will usually show 100% cellular marrow with increased granulocyte precursors, basophils, eosinophils, and occasional monocytes. In CLL, the white cell count is elevated, with mostly CD5+ and CD23+ B-lymphocytes.
