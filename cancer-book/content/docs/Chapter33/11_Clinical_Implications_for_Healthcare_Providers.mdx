## 33.10.1 Recognition and Referral

**Early Detection**:
Healthcare providers must maintain high clinical suspicion for hematologic malignancies in patients presenting with unexplained cytopenias, lymphadenopathy, or systemic symptoms. Early recognition and prompt referral to hematology/oncology specialists are crucial for optimal outcomes.

**Diagnostic Workup**:
If any of these symptoms are observed, the primary care provider seeks a hematology consultation or opinion as soon as possible for timely diagnosis and treatment, since timely identification and treatment of lymphomas result in better survival rates with the least number of complications.

## 33.10.2 Interprofessional Collaboration

**Team-Based Care**:
While a hematologist is almost always involved in the care of patients with lymphoma, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a radiologist, radiation oncologist, pathologist, and a surgical oncologist.

**Coordinated Management**:
Interprofessional teamwork and decision-making with the patient are vitally important, and side effects that may hinder treatment adherence should be discussed directly with the patient. The healthcare team needs to identify side effects early, make patient concerns a priority, and combat any challenges as soon as possible.
