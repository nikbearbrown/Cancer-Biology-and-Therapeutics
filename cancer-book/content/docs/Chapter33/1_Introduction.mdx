Hematologic malignancies represent a diverse group of cancers that arise from cells of the blood and bone marrow. These diseases affect the production and function of blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the three major categories of hematologic malignancies: leukemias, lymphomas, and plasma cell dyscrasias.
