title: 33.2 Lymphomas
---



## 33.2.1 Classification and Overview

Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that arise from the clonal proliferation of B- cell, T- cell and natural killer (NK) cell subsets of lymphocytes at different stages of maturation. Lymphoma comprises heterogeneous malignancies that arise from the clonal proliferation of lymphocytes. It represents approximately 5% of malignancies. Overall survival is estimated to be 72%.

Different stressors in the form of infectious, inflammatory, and toxic factors interact with the genetic makeup of the human host in a complex manner to result in lymphomagenesis. One of the widely accepted principles of lymphomagenesis is being on long term immunosuppressive therapies, which makes the innate immune system less able to detect and destroy cancer cells or ward off infections that could result in cancers.

## 33.2.2 Hodgkin Lymphoma

**Epidemiology and Pathological Features**:
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a rare monoclonal lymphoid neoplasm characterized by the following four features: HL usually presents in young adults, commonly arises in cervical lymph nodes, involves scattered large mononuclear Hodgkin and multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells on a background of non-neoplastic inflammatory cells, and characteristic neoplastic cells are often surrounded by T lymphocytes.

Hodgkin lymphoma generally has an excellent prognosis, though this depends on several factors. HL is divided into two distinct categories that demonstrate different pathologic and clinical features: classical Hodgkin lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLP-HL).

**Subtypes and Classification**:
Classical Hodgkin lymphoma accounts for approximately 95 percent of HL and is further subdivided into four subgroups: nodular sclerosis (NSHL), lymphocyte-rich (LRHL), mixed cellularity (MCHL), and lymphocyte-depleted (LDHL).

**Diagnostic Approach**:
Definitive diagnosis for Hodgkin lymphoma is through biopsy from a lymph node or suspected organ. It is important to note that fine-needle aspiration or core-needle biopsy frequently shows non-specific findings because of the low ratio of malignant cells and loss of architectural information. Excisional biopsy should be pursued if suspicion of Hodgkin lymphoma is high.

## 33.2.3 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma

**Classification and Epidemiology**:
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a neoplasm of the lymphoid tissues originating from B cell precursors, mature B cells, T cell precursors, and mature T cells. NHL comprises various subtypes, each with different epidemiologies, etiologies, immunophenotypic, genetic, clinical features, and response to therapy.

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is the 6th most common type of cancer in the UK. It is more common in people aged over 65 years and the increasing age of the population therefore impacts markedly on the total number of patients with NHL. NHL is more frequent in men than in women.

**Clinical Categories**:
It can be divided into 2 groups, 'indolent' and 'aggressive,' based on the disease's prognosis. The most common mature B cell neoplasms are Follicular lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, Mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and primary CNS lymphoma.

**Global Distribution**:
NHL is the 13th most common cancer type worldwide, with an estimated 509,600 new cases (2.8% of all new cancer cases) and 248,700 deaths (2.6% of all cancer deaths) in 2018. The incidence varies globally.

**Staging System**:
The Lugano classification is the current staging used for patients with NHL. It is based on the Ann Arbor staging system, originally developed for Hodgkin lymphoma in 1974 and modified in 1988. This staging system is based on the number of tumor sites (nodal and extranodal) and their location.

## 33.2.4 Specific NHL Subtypes

**Burkitt Lymphoma**:
Burkitt lymphoma is an aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. The disease is associated with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and chromosomal translocations that cause the overexpression of oncogene C-MYC. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies Burkitt lymphoma into 3 clinical groups: endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-related.

**Mantle Cell Lymphoma**:
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) characterized by an (11,14) translocation resulting in overexpression of the cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene. It typically follows an aggressive clinical course (aggressive MCL), although an indolent leukemia variant (indolent MCL) has been described.

**T-Cell Lymphomas**:
T-cell lymphomas are the uncommon and rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. This disease group has a poor prognosis compared to their B-cell counterpart. Adult T-cell lymphoma and mycosis fungoides are the most common mature T cell lymphomas.

## 33.2.5 Pediatric Lymphoma Considerations

**Epidemiology and Subtypes**:
Lymphoma is the third most common pediatric neoplasm after leukemia and brain tumor, accounting for 10â€“15% of cancers in children. In the United States, the incidence of lymphoma in children is approximately 25 per million, and there are close to 2000 new lymphoma cases diagnosed in children every year.

Common pediatric lymphomas include Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Advances in understanding the biology of these lymphomas have led to significantly improved therapeutic outcome and made lymphoma one of the most curable pediatric cancers.
