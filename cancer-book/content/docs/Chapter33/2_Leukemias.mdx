## 33.1.1 Classification and Overview

The production of abnormal leukocytes defines leukemia as either a primary or secondary process. They can be classified as acute or chronic based on the rapidity of proliferation and myeloid or lymphoid based on the cell of origin. Predominant subtypes are acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), involving the myeloid lineage; acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), involving the lymphoid chain.

However, with the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the identification of various biomarkers, the World Health Organization (WHO) classification was updated in 2016, bringing multiple changes to the traditional classification for acute leukemias and myeloid neoplasms. GLOBOCAN, a global observatory for cancer trends, showed a global incidence of 474,519 cases with significant regional variation.

## 33.1.2 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)

**Epidemiology and Clinical Presentation**:
Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a malignancy of B or T lymphoblasts characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal, immature lymphocytes and their progenitors, which ultimately leads to the replacement of bone marrow elements and other lymphoid organs resulting in a typical disease pattern characteristic of acute lymphocytic leukemia. ALL accounts for approximately 2 percent of the lymphoid neoplasms diagnosed in the United States.

Acute lymphocytic leukemia occurs slightly more frequently in males than females and three times as frequently in Whites as in Blacks. Patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia typically present with symptoms related to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia due to the replacement of the bone marrow with the tumor.

**Clinical Manifestations**:
Patients typically present with symptoms related to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia due to the replacement of the bone marrow with the tumor. Symptoms can include fatigue, easy or spontaneous bruising and/or bleeding, and infections. Additionally, B-symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss, are often present but may be mild, and hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy can be seen in up to half of adults on presentation.

Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is common and can be accompanied by cranial neuropathies or symptoms, predominantly meningeal, related to increased intracranial pressure.

**Treatment Approaches**:
Children who are suspected of having acute lymphocytic leukemia should be referred to a pediatric center that specializes in cancer for evaluation and treatment. For children with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, induction therapy consists of anthracycline, vincristine, 1-asparaginase, and a corticosteroid.

Successful treatment of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia involves the administration of a multidrug regimen that is divided into several phases (i.e., induction, consolidation, and maintenance) and includes therapy directed to the central nervous system (CNS). Most treatment protocols take two to three years to complete.

## 33.1.3 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

**Pathophysiology and Classification**:
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing myeloid neoplasm characterized by the clonal expansion of immature myeloid-derived cells, known as blasts, in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. This expansion results in ineffective erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, clinically manifesting as relatively rapid bone marrow failure compared to chronic and indolent leukemias.

The recent consensus guidelines established by the European LeukemiaNET (ELN) in 2022 have emphasized molecular characterization and risk stratification for individuals with AML, providing updated data on these aspects.

**Risk Factors and Secondary AML**:
Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, which include myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and chronic myeloid leukemia, may also progress or evolve into a higher-grade myeloid neoplasm such as AML. Another group of patients at risk for AML includes patients who have previously received chemotherapy for other malignancies.

Based on its etiology, AML can be categorized into 3 main typesâ€”de novo AML, which arises spontaneously; secondary AML (s-AML), which evolves from prior myeloproliferative disorders or MDS; and therapy-related AML, resulting from exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, radiation therapy, or toxins.

**Treatment and Prognosis**:
Treatment options vary depending on patient-specific factors, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant remains the only curative therapy. Although the administration of multiagent induction chemotherapy can induce complete remission, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only established curative therapy. Despite advancements in therapeutic approaches, prognosis remains suboptimal, especially among the older populations.

## 33.1.4 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)

**Epidemiology and Pathophysiology**:
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) is an indolent malignancy characterized by increased production of mature but dysfunctional B lymphocytes. CLL/SLL is defined as a monoclonal lymphoproliferative disease characterized by the proliferation and accumulation of morphologically mature but immunologically dysfunctional B-cell lymphocytes that are smudge cells, as noted on peripheral smear.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by monoclonal B cell proliferation. It is the most common adult leukemia in Western populations and comprises 25 to 30 percent of leukemias in the United States.

**Clinical Course and Staging**:
CLL and SLL are identical from a pathologic and immunophenotypic standpoint. Both CLL and SLL originate from B-cell lymphocytes but present with different manifestations depending on where the abnormal cells are found. Usually, the initial leukemic phase represents CLL, where the cells are present in the blood. This eventually progresses to the lymphoma phase, representing SLL, where the cells are found in the lymph nodes.

**Prognostic Factors**:
The patients who present as Rai stage 0-II may survive for 5 to 20 years with no treatment. Lymphocyte doubling time is a prognostic factor of CLL, defined as the number of months it takes to double the absolute lymphocyte count. Favorable prognostic factors include mutated Ig heavy chain variable region, 13 q deletion, low expression of ZAP-70, and low CD38 levels on flow cytometry.

**Treatment Approaches**:
Treatment, including chemotherapy/immunotherapy, is generally not curative and is given only in symptomatic patients. Asymptomatic patients are generally observed. Current first-line treatment for CLL now includes BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors. About 2 to 10% of CLL patients undergo Richter's transformation, where CLL evolved into an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

## 33.1.5 Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)

**Molecular Characteristics**:
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), BCR-ABL1-positive, is classified as a myeloproliferative neoplasm predominantly composed of proliferating granulocytes and determined to have the Philadelphia chromosome/translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). CML affects both the peripheral blood and the bone marrow.

CML typically arises from reciprocal translocation and fusion of BCR on chromosome 22 and ABL1 on chromosome 9, resulting in dysregulated tyrosine kinase on chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. This, in turn, causes a monoclonal population of dysfunctional granulocytes, predominantly neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils.

**Disease Phases**:
Chronic myelogenous leukemia has 3 phases chronic, acute, and blastic. The white blood cell count in chronic leukemia is often elevated, with a smear suggestive of significant left shift/granulocyte predominance. In CML, the translocation t(9;22) can be diagnosed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) on peripheral blood.

**Treatment Revolution**:
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective in most cases; however, the patient's non-compliance is a prominent cause of failure. The future prognostic evaluation may include sequencing for mutations involving known cancer genes, such as IKZF1, RUNX1, ASXL1, BCORL1, and IDH1.
