## 33.8.1 Symptom Management

**Infection Prevention**:
Multiple myeloma causes anaemia, lytic bone lesions and fractures, kidney damage and severe bacterial infections resultant of profound immunodeficiency. Antibiotic prophylaxis is an obvious strategy to prevent infection, hospital admission and early death.

**Supportive Therapies**:
Nurses play a crucial role in patient education, symptom management, and psychosocial support, addressing concerns about adverse effects of treatment and emotional well-being. Pharmacists contribute by ensuring the safe administration of chemotherapy, preventing drug interactions, and managing supportive medications.

## 33.8.2 Quality of Life Considerations

**Psychological Support**:
The common symptoms of this disease are persistent fevers, drenching night sweats, unintentional weight loss, and generalized or localized swelling of the lymph nodes. These symptoms can significantly impact quality of life and require comprehensive supportive care.

**Long-term Monitoring**:
Cranial irradiation, a history of intrathecal chemotherapy, older age at the time of treatment, and hematopoietic cell transplantation can lead to neurologic and psychiatric complications like post-traumatic stress disorder.
