## 33.5.1 General Treatment Principles

**Multidisciplinary Care**:
The management of hematologic malignancies requires a highly coordinated, interprofessional approach to ensure optimal patient outcomes, safety, and quality of care. Physicians, including hematologists and oncologists, lead the diagnostic and staging process using advanced imaging and molecular profiling to tailor treatment strategies.

**Treatment Categories**:
The treatment of NHL varies greatly, depending on tumor stage, grade, type of lymphoma, and various patient factors (eg, symptoms, age, performance status). It can affect both young and older adults.

## 33.5.2 Specific Treatment Modalities

**Chemotherapy**:
Most treatment protocols take two to three years to complete. Today consolidation therapy is widely used and includes therapy with a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs with good results. Maintenance therapy utilizes oral 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate delivered once weekly or once monthly.

**Targeted Therapy**:
Current first-line treatment for CLL now includes BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors. Following are the important classes of drugs commonly used in the treatment of CLL: BTK inhibitors (Bruton tyrosine kinase), including ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax.

**Stem Cell Transplantation**:
Auto-HSCT remains the standard of care for young and fit MM patients. MEL 200 mg/m2 (MEL-200) is the standard high-dose regimen, and the source of PBS. Although the administration of multiagent induction chemotherapy can achieve complete remission, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only established curative therapy.

## 33.5.3 Treatment-Related Complications

**Acute Complications**:
The hampered production of normal blood cells due to leukemic infiltration of the bone marrow can also cause other symptoms and complications. Patients on chemotherapy should be monitored for infections and receive prophylaxis for common infectious agents.

**Long-term Effects**:
These side effects may include chronic fatigue, thyroid and gonadal dysfunction, infertility, chronic infection, accelerated coronary heart disease, osteopenia, cataracts, iron overload, adverse psychological outcomes, and second cancers.
