## 33.9.1 Emerging Therapies

**Targeted Treatments**:
Research is still ongoing concerning optimal treatment selection and sequencing of various options in the course of treatment. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating combination treatment strategies and new drugs.

**Immunotherapy**:
Patients treated with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) risk developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). CAR-T cell treatments recognizing the complications and side effects related to these treatments can help guide the management of MCL patients effectively.

## 33.9.2 Precision Medicine

**Molecular Profiling**:
The use of cytogenetics and molecular markers gained through next-generation sequencing is necessary for risk stratification and can guide upfront frontline therapy. Several molecular markers such as FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, IDH, And other mutations are important for risk assessment.

**Biomarker Development**:
Levels of soluble CD138 were elevated in 72% of TEAMM trial patients compared with the healthy cohort, confirming its utility as a biomarker of active disease. During treatment levels of soluble CD138 decreased every 4 weeks.
