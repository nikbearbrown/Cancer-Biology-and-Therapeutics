title: 33.6 Prognosis and Outcomes

## 33.6.1 Prognostic Factors

**Disease-Specific Factors**:
The prognosis of plasma cell neoplasms depends on the disease entity. PCM prognosis depends on multiple factors including disease stage, genetics, host factors (age, performance status, co-morbidities), response to therapy, disease biology, and others.

**Cytogenetic Risk Stratification**:
FISH can identify the following poor cytogenetic findings: t(4;14), t(14;16), and/or del 17p which account for about 25% of patients with MM, the remaining 75% having a so-called standard risk.

## 33.6.2 Survival Outcomes

**Hodgkin Lymphoma**:
Hodgkin lymphoma generally has an excellent prognosis, though this depends on several factors. The 5-year disease-free survival after completion of therapy exceeds 85% for most pediatric lymphomas.

**Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma**:
The course of follicular lymphoma is quite variable. Some patients can be observed with waxing and waning disease for 5 years or more without the need for therapy. The median survival for patients with stage III and IV disease is between 7 and 10 years.

**Multiple Myeloma**:
Although the median survival has improved to 5 years with current standards of treatment, the annual costs of modern therapies can range from $50,000 to $125,000 per patient.
