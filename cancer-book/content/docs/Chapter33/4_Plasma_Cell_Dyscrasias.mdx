title: 33.3 Plasma Cell Dyscrasias
---



## 33.3.1 Overview and Classification

Plasma cell dyscrasias (PCDs) are a group of clonal disorders characterized by the uninhibited expansion of a monoclonal population of malignant plasma cells. Multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common malignant plasma cell tumor, accounting for about 1 percent of all cancer types, and the second most common hematologic malignancy in the United States.

Plasma cell neoplasms (PCN) is a group of mature B-cell disorders that result from an abnormal generation of cloned plasma cells that produce monoclonal, heavy-chain, class-switched immunoglobulin referred to as paraprotein or M-protein. According to the WHO classification in 2017, this class of neoplasms includes non-IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), plasmacytoma, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition diseases, and plasma cell myeloma (PCM).

## 33.3.2 Multiple Myeloma

**Epidemiology and Pathophysiology**:
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell proliferative disorder characterized by the abnormal increase of monoclonal immunoglobulins. Unchecked, the excess production of these plasma cells can ultimately lead to specific end-organ damage. With an age-adjusted incidence rate of 5.5 cases per 100,000 population, the American Cancer Society estimated that there were 19,900 new diagnoses and 10,790 deaths due to myeloma in 2007.

Multiple myeloma (MM) consists of a malignant proliferation of BM plasmatic cells (BMPCs), which produce a monoclonal protein that can be found in serum and/or urine, resulting in skeletal involvement, hypercalcemia, anemia, renal function impairment, and/or soft-tissue plasmacytomas.

**Clinical Manifestations**:
Most commonly, this is seen when at least one of the following clinical manifestations are present: hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, or bone pain accompanied by lytic lesions. The initial symptoms of multiple myeloma are often subtle and can include malaise, fatigue, weight loss, and bone pain.

**CRAB Criteria**:
Historically, we have diagnosed MM if clonal bone marrow plasma cells were greater than or equal than 10% on bone marrow biopsy (or if a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma was present) in addition to at least one of the following CRAB criteria:

- **C**alcium: Serum calcium level greater than 0.25 mmol/L (greater than 1 mg/dL) higher than the upper limit of normal
- **R**enal insufficiency: creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL or creatinine clearance less than 40 mL per minute
- **A**nemia: hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL or hemoglobin greater than 2 g/dL below the lower limit of normal
- **B**one lesions: One or more osteolytic bone lesions on skeletal radiography, CT, or PET-CT

**Complications and Management**:
Early identification is important to assure timely treatment and infection resolution. Neuropathy is also commonly seen. It can be secondary to the plasma cell dyscrasia itself, direct compression, or light chain deposition. Also significant is the increased risk for thrombosis.

**Treatment Approaches**:
When compared with chemotherapy alone, intensified chemotherapy followed by HCT has been shown to improve both the disease-free survival and the overall survival. For high and intermediate-risk groups, induction chemotherapy followed by HCT and maintenance therapy is recommended.

## 33.3.3 Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS)

**Definition and Clinical Significance**:
The mildest and most common PCD is the precancerous monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), affecting approximately 3 percent of the general population 50 years of age or older. MGUS can progress to asymptomatic MM (also called smoldering or indolent MM) or symptomatic MM.

Monoclonal protein (M-protein) exists in about 3% of adults older than 50 years and increases to 5% in those older than 70 years. Despite significant advances in treating multiple myeloma, the overall prognosis of renal recovery is still poor.

**Monitoring and Management**:
Patients with MGUS or smoldering myeloma do not respond more frequently, achieve longer remissions, or have improved survival if chemotherapy is started early while they are still asymptomatic as opposed to waiting for progression before treatment is initiated. Newer therapies have not been proven to prevent or delay the progression of MGUS to a plasma cell dyscrasia.

## 33.3.4 Plasmacytoma

**Classification and Characteristics**:
Plasmacytoma is a tumor of plasma cells of bony or soft tissue and can occur anywhere in the body without evidence of systemic disease. It may present as a solitary or multiple mass anywhere in the body. It can progress to multiple myeloma if not evaluated and appropriately managed.

Plasmacytoma can be divided into the following types according to the International Myeloma Working Group: Solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB), which arises from plasma cells of the bone marrow, and Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP), which arises from plasma cells of the mucosal surfaces.

**Clinical Features and Prognosis**:
Solitary plasmacytoma is the most common form of plasmacytoma. Most cases of plasmacytomas cause paraproteinemia. SBP shows progression to PCM or multiple plasmacytoma in up to 70% of cases, therefore close observation and follow up is crucial.

## 33.3.5 Related Conditions

**Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia**:
Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia has a natural history and therapeutic options similar to CLL, with the exception of hyperviscosity syndrome associated with macroglobulinemia as a result of elevated immunoglobulin M. The median survival is approximately 50 months, not that dissimilar from the best reported series of patients with MM.

**Amyloidosis**:
Other PCDs include systemic (primary) AL amyloidosis, also called light-chain amyloidosis (in which amyloid [A] proteins derived from immunoglobulin light chains [L] are deposited in tissue), as well as macroglobulinemia, solitary plasmacytoma, and plasma cell leukemia.
