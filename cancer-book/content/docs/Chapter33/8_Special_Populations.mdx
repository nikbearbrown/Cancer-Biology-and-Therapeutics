## 33.7.1 Pediatric Considerations

**Unique Features**:
Lymphoma is the third most common pediatric neoplasm after leukemia and brain tumor, accounting for 10â€“15% of cancers in children. Advances in understanding the biology of these lymphomas have led to significantly improved therapeutic outcome and made lymphoma one of the most curable pediatric cancers.

**Treatment Approaches**:
Children who are suspected of having acute lymphocytic leukemia should be referred to a pediatric center that specializes in cancer for evaluation and treatment. For children with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, induction therapy consists of anthracycline, vincristine, 1-asparaginase, and a corticosteroid.

## 33.7.2 Elderly Patients

**Treatment Considerations**:
Despite advancements in therapeutic approaches, prognosis remains suboptimal, especially among the older populations. If a patient is not a candidate for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT, the only treatment option is chemotherapy alone.

**Comorbidity Management**:
The patients with multiple chain lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia have a worse prognosis. Patients with multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies often have kidney dysfunction due to a wide range of associated pathologies.
