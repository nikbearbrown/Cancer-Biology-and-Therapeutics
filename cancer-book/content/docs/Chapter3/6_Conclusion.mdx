The global cancer burden continues to evolve in response to demographic transitions, changing risk factor patterns, and varying levels of healthcare infrastructure. Changing fertility patterns and increasing life expectancy are leading to major changes in the scale of the cancer problem worldwide for populations at all levels of human development. A cancer transition is clearly underway in countries transiting to high levels of income and development whereby reductions in infection-related cancers are offset by concomitant increases in cancers linked to a "Westernization" of lifestyle.

Adequate surveillance mechanisms at the country level are needed to monitor progress. With a greater number of governments adopting national cancer control plans, attention is increasingly turning to population-based cancer surveillance data as a central component in prioritizing and evaluating interventions.

The evidence demonstrates that cancer remains a complex disease influenced by both genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, with the relative contributions varying by cancer type and population. The big challenge for epidemiology now is to develop strategies to ensure that the advances in human genomics are incorporated appropriately into population studies, as well as family-based, and hybrid studies. Understanding these patterns is crucial for developing effective, evidence-based cancer prevention and control strategies that address the diverse needs of populations worldwide.
