## 3.3.1 Tobacco Use

**Epidemiological Evidence**

Smoking accounts for at least 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 80 percent of lung cancer deaths. Lung cancer, for which smoking is the primary risk factor, is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. However, smoking heightens the risk of up to 18 types of cancers, including head and neck cancers, leukemia, and cancers of the esophagus, bladder, pancreas, kidney, liver, stomach, colorectum, cervix, uterus, and ovaries.

Tobacco, through its various forms of exposure, constitutes the main cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide among men, and increasingly among women. Forms of exposure include active smoking, breathing secondhand tobacco smoke (passive or involuntary smoking) and smokeless tobacco. The total death toll in 2005 from tobacco use was estimated at 5.4 million people, including about 1.5 million cancer deaths.

**Carcinogenic Mechanisms**

Cigarette smoke contains more than 7,000 compounds, at least 60 of which are known carcinogens. Inhaling this mix of chemicals through smoke induces tissue injury and changes in the cellular environment that foster proliferation and transformation into cancer cells.

There are more than 7,000 chemicals in combustible tobacco cigarette smoke, and more than 70 are established human carcinogens. In addition to combustible tobacco cigarette smoking, pipe and cigar smoking are established causes of lung cancer. Furthermore, even exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke, which results in much lower levels of smoke exposure than active smoking, is causally associated with lung cancer.

**Secondhand Smoke**

The risk of lung cancer in cigarette smokers is directly related to the number of cigarettes smoked. Among smokers, an increase in exposure leads to an increase in risk, as long as the additional tobacco smoke, whether through active or passive smoking, reaches the bronchial epithelium.

One meta-analysis of 5 cohort and 34 case-control studies found that nonsmoking women who lived with a smoker had an approximately 25 percent greater risk of developing lung cancer than non-smoking women who lived with a nonsmoker.

## 3.3.2 Physical Activity and Obesity

**Physical Activity and Cancer Risk**

Obesity increases the risk of breast, endometrial, colorectal, kidney, and esophageal cancer. Physical inactivity, dietary factors, obesity and being overweight play an important role as causes of cancer. Overweight and obesity are causally associated with several common cancer types, including cancers of the oesophagus, colorectum, breast in postmenopausal women, endometrium and kidney.

**Mechanisms**

Physical inactivity is a major contributor to the rise in rates of overweight and obesity in many parts of the world, and independently increases the risk of some cancers. Because all these factors are intimately interconnected at the individual and contextual levels, estimating the specific contribution of each of these risk factors is difficult and might underestimate the cumulative potential risk.

## 3.3.3 Diet and Nutrition

**Dietary Risk Factors**

Consumption of red meat and processed meat increases the risk of colorectal cancer by an estimated 43 percent. Another major dietary risk factor is high salt intake, which increases the risk of stomach cancer. Globally, salt intake has declined, and the associated cancer burden has declined as a result.

The global network of World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) International comprises registered charities in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands as well as the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) in the USA. The WCRF International network was the first organization to focus exclusively on the links between cancer and nutrition, and more recently physical activity.

**Nutritional Epidemiology**

Discoveries that both essential and nonessential dietary nutrients can markedly influence several key biological events—including cell cycle regulation, processes involved in replication or transcription, immunocompetence, and factors involved with apoptosis, or programmed cell death—have strengthened convictions that specific foods or components may markedly influence cancer risk.
