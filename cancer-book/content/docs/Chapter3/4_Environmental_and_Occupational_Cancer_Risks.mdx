## 3.4.1 Environmental Carcinogens

**Environmental Pollution**

Environmental pollution of air, water and soil with carcinogenic chemicals accounts for 1–4% of all cancers. Exposure to carcinogenic chemicals in the environment can occur through drinking water or pollution of indoor and ambient air. In Bangladesh, 5–10% of all cancer deaths in an arsenic-contaminated region were attributable to arsenic exposure.

**Indoor Air Pollution**

Indoor air pollution from coal fires doubles the risk of lung cancer, particularly among non-smoking women. Worldwide, indoor air pollution from domestic coal fires is responsible for approximately 1.5% of all lung cancer deaths. Coal use in households is particularly widespread in Asia.

## 3.4.2 Occupational Carcinogens

**Occupational Exposures**

More than 40 agents, mixtures and exposure circumstances in the working environment are carcinogenic to humans and are classified as occupational carcinogens. That occupational carcinogens are causally related to cancer of the lung, bladder, larynx and skin, leukaemia and nasopharyngeal cancer is well documented. Mesothelioma (cancer of the outer lining of the lung or chest cavity) is to a large extent caused by work-related exposure to asbestos.

**High-Risk Occupations**

Examples of exposures that increase risk for hematologic malignancies include benzene (and other organic solvents), pesticides, radiation, and chemotherapy. The latency period between initial exposure and diagnosis of a secondary HM is 2 to 3 years for patients who were exposed to topoisomerase II inhibitors and 5 to 7 years for those who were exposed to alkylating agents or radiation therapy.
