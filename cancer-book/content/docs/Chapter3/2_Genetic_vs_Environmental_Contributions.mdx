## 3.2.1 Frameworks for Understanding Cancer Causation

**Multifactorial Models of Disease**

The second approach to studying how variations in genes contribute to variations in disease risk focuses on understanding the genetic susceptibility to diseases as the consequence of the joint effects of many genes, each with small to moderate effects and often interacting among themselves and with the environment to give rise to the distribution of disease risk seen in a population.

In most cases, the combined effects of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors determine a person's likelihood of being affected with a condition, such as cancer. Clustering of cancer among relatives is common. However, determining the underlying causes of this is difficult when there is not a clear pattern of cancer in the family.

**Gene-Environment Interactions**

The interactions of multiple modifier genes with various environmental factors—that is, gene–environment interactions—explain why cancer rates vary across populations, among exposed groups, and even within families.

Multiple genes can interaction with a number of environments in the development of cancer. The macroenvironment—our lifestyle, the air we breathe, the food we eat, the chemicals we are exposed to, as well as viruses, radiation, and physical agents we come in contact with—combines with the microenvironment of our cells to either prevent or enhance carcinogenesis.

## 3.2.2 Evidence for Genetic Contributions

**Family Studies and Hereditary Risk**

Family history is often one of the strongest risk factors for common disease complexes such as cancer. A person inherits a complete set of genes from each parent, as well as a vast array of cultural and socioeconomic experiences from his/her family. Family history is thought to be a good predictor of an individual's disease risk because family members most closely represent the unique genomic and environmental interactions that an individual experiences.

Shared environmental risk factors may contribute heavily to the familial occurrence of cancer, e.g., a familial habit of heavy smoking to the clustering of lung cancer, and they should be ascertained. A negative family history of cancer does not exclude a familial cancer syndrome for several reasons. Virtually none of the germline mutations involved in hereditary cancer have a 100% penetrance.

**High-Penetrance Cancer Susceptibility Genes**

Pathogenic variants in high-penetrance genes have been identified as the cause of inherited cancer risk in some colon cancer–prone families; these are estimated to account for only 5% to 6% of CRC cases overall. In addition, pathogenic variants in lower-penetrance genes may contribute to familial colon cancer risk.

Major genes are typically considered those that are involved in single-gene disorders, and the diseases caused by major genes are often relatively rare. Most pathogenic variants in major genes lead to a very high risk of disease, and environmental contributions are often difficult to recognize.

**Moderate and Low-Penetrance Variants**

The polymorphic susceptibility genes or genetic variants are generally associated with low penetrance and low relative and absolute risks, but they are very common in the population (more than 1 percent) and may be involved in a high proportion of cancers through biologic interactions with environmental or endogenous exposures.

## 3.2.3 Evidence for Environmental Contributions

**Migration Studies**

A growing body of knowledge dramatically illustrates the influence of the environment, genes, and their interactions in the international variation reported in cancer incidence. A variety of linkages clearly exist between environmental exposures, diet, lifestyle factors, and cancer.

**Population Attributable Fractions**

The population attributable fraction (PAF) is a standard measure used to quantify the proportion of disease burden attributable to a risk factor. It is calculated using information on the prevalence of a risk factor in a population and the relative risk that the risk factor poses for development of disease.

**Environmental Carcinogen Evidence**

The available epidemiologic evidence indicates that while environmental exposures drive the demographic patterns for most cancers, there are growing indications that gene variants may have a sizable impact on cancer development by modifying the effects of exogenous or endogenous risk factors.

## 3.2.4 Integrating Genetic and Environmental Factors

**Gene-Environment Interaction Research**

The study of gene-environment and gene-gene interactions represents a broad class of genetic association studies focused on understanding how human genetic variability is associated with differential responses to environmental exposures and with differential effects depending on variations in other genes.

Much of the work on identifying functional polymorphisms that influence an individual's cancer risk has focused on gene products involved in the activation and detoxification of carcinogens and, more recently, on DNA repair.

**Molecular Epidemiology Approaches**

Recent progress in identifying and characterizing highly penetrant susceptibility genes in familial cancer has revolutionized our understanding of the critical genetic mechanisms in cancer etiology. Studies that combine genetic analysis with assessment of exposures and diet can explain why not everyone exposed to a particular cancer-causing chemical will develop cancer.
