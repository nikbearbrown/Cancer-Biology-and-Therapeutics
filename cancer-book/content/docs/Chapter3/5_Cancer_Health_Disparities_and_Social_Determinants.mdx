## 3.5.1 Conceptualizing Cancer Disparities

**Human Development and Cancer**

Human development plays a critical role in understanding the shifting scale and profile of cancer globally. The Human Development Index (HDI), with a four-tier categorization of countries as having low, medium, high, or very high HDI, provides a useful framework for assessing the global cancer burden geographically and over time.

**Epidemiological Transition**

Omran's theory of epidemiological transition focused on how changing health and disease patterns interact with societal, economic, and demographic factors. In the third stage of the transition, the model describes how chronic diseases increase as life expectancy rises beyond age 70 years and mortality from degenerative diseases is postponed to older ages.

## 3.5.2 Global Cancer Disparities

**Development Level Disparities**

When assessed by specific types of cancers, YLL was observed to be the main contributor to DALYs overall. In general, individuals in countries with higher HDI were observed to live a greater number of years with disability, whereas individuals in countries with lower HDI were observed to have a greater burden of premature mortality.

**Resource Disparities**

The developed countries are barely able to cope up with the exponential increase in the cancer-related services, and the current situation in developing countries, that is, low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) is much worse.

## 3.5.3 Healthcare Access and Cancer Disparities

**Healthcare System Factors**

Cancer genetics risk assessment and genetic counseling includes family history, psychosocial assessments, and education on hereditary cancer syndromes, testing, and risk. Individuals are considered to be candidates for cancer risk assessment if they have a personal and/or family history or clinical characteristics with features suggestive of hereditary cancer.

**Data and Surveillance Disparities**

Data on the medically underserved population are not usually included in cancer statistics reports. The information could be obtained by revision of the source documents to include the necessary data or by special studies. Implementation of the required changes will take time, but the revision of source documents would have a more permanent effect.
