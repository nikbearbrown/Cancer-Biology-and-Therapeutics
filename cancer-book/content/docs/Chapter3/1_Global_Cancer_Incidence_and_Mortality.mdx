title: 3.1 Global Cancer Incidence and Mortality

## 3.1.1 Current Global Cancer Burden

Cancer has emerged as a leading cause of death worldwide, with NCDs accounting for 72% of all deaths globally in 2016. Of the 15.2 million premature deaths from NCDs, 4.5 million (29.8%) were due to cancer. Each year, 5 million people in low- and middle-income countries die from cancer, representing about 10 percent of the 50 million deaths in those countries.

The most common cancer worldwide is lung cancer with 2.1 million new cases in 2018, followed by 1.8 million deaths. The global cancer burden continues to demonstrate significant variation by development level and geographic region.

**Leading Cancer Types Globally**

In 2018, 45% of the estimated new cancer cases occurred in countries with very high HDI, compared with 36%, 16%, and 4% in countries with high, medium, and low HDI, respectively. The distribution of cancer types varies significantly by development level:

In countries with low HDI, there is a high residual burden of infection- and poverty-related cancers, where cancers of the cervix, liver, and oesophagus are leading cancers, compared with countries with high or very high HDI, where the most frequent cancers are those of the prostate, breast, colorectum, and lung.

**Cancer Mortality Patterns**

The greatest number of cancer deaths occurred in countries with high HDI, driven by the 2.9 million cancer deaths that occurred in China. However, mortality-to-incidence ratios vary substantially by development level, with lower-resource countries experiencing poorer outcomes despite lower incidence rates.

## 3.1.2 Regional Variations in Cancer Burden

**High-Income Countries (HICs)**

In the USA and other high-income countries, declines in smoking prevalence have resulted in substantial decreases in incidence rates of lung cancer and laryngeal cancer. Elsewhere, and especially in low- and middle-income countries, the cancer burden from smoking continues to increase as a result of population growth and the ageing of smokers.

**Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)**

The majority of cancer cases globally now occur in LMIC, and 65% of cancer deaths worldwide occur in these countries. These countries face a distinct cancer profile characterized by:

In countries with medium HDI, there is still a large burden of infection-related cancers, including cancers of the stomach, liver, and oesophagus. In 2012, the proportion of new cancer cases attributable to infectious agents was 25.3%, 21.5%, 13.2%, and 7.6% in countries with low, medium, high, and very high HDI, respectively.

**Regional Cancer Patterns**

The incidence of colon and rectal cancers varies about 25-fold from the high-income and high incidence areas (North America, Australia and New Zealand, Western Europe, and Japan) to Africa and Asia, where incidence is lowest. Specific regional patterns include:

- **Colorectal cancer**: Where rates historically have been low (particularly in Asia), they seem to be rising
- **Breast cancer**: Breast cancer is increasing in incidence everywhere, but more so where rates historically have been low. In China, annual increases of 3 to 4 percent are reported
- **Liver cancer**: Although it is sixth in incidence worldwide, it is third in mortality, after lung and stomach cancers. With 5-year survival at 5 percent or less even in developed countries

## 3.1.3 Temporal Trends in Cancer Incidence and Mortality

**Changing Cancer Patterns**

The ongoing cancer transition includes a reduction in infection-related cancers (for example, stomach and cervical cancer) that is offset by increases in cancers linked to a Westernization of lifestyle (for example, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer).

**Stomach Cancer Trends**

A key epidemiological finding is the steady decline in incidence and mortality rates of stomach cancer (predominantly the non-cardia type of stomach cancer) that has consistently been observed over more than five decades across all world regions. In contrast to the overall decline in rates of non-cardia stomach cancer, studies have indicated an increasing incidence of cardia stomach cancer in several populations.

## 3.1.4 Cancer Surveillance and Monitoring Systems

**Population-Based Cancer Registries**

The central purpose of state cancer registries is cancer surveillance, monitoring the burden of cancer for a given population. When registration activities are organized to obtain complete counts of cancer for a given population, the system is said to be "population-based".

The need of accurate data of cancer cases in a country is imperative to develop cancer control programs and screening guidelines. Unless the burden of each cancer type and subtype is known, it is hard to allocate appropriate resources for prevention or treatment of the specific types of cancer.

**International Collaborative Efforts**

IARC is responsible for the compilation, estimation, and reporting of cancer statistics generated through flagship projects and databases, including Cancer Incidence in Five Continents and GLOBOCAN, for which the resulting statistics are disseminated on the Global Cancer Observatory.

IARC gathers data on incidence, mortality, and survival for hundreds of countries. The data are available electronically and in published reports. Most prominently, the 8th edition of its report, Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, includes information on more than 200 countries. IARC also estimates cancer incidence and mortality for every country in the world in its GLOBOCAN electronic database.

**Data Quality Challenges**

About 18 percent of low-income countries have recorded mortality data any time since 1950, and about 35 percent have published some population-based incidence data, although fewer than half of them are represented in the most recent edition of IARC's Cancer Incidence in Five Continents.

With a greater number of governments adopting national cancer control plans, attention is increasingly turning to population-based cancer surveillance data as a central component in prioritizing and evaluating interventions. For many LMICs, national vital statistics are unavailable, partial, or inaccurate.
