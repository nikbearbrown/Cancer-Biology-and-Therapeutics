title: 15.3 Implications for Treatment Resistance
---


The recognition that tumors contain heterogeneous populations of cells with varying degrees of treatment sensitivity has profound implications for therapeutic strategies. Treatment resistance represents one of the most significant clinical challenges in oncology, often determining the difference between cure and treatment failure.

## 15.3.1 Mechanisms of Treatment Resistance in Cancer Stem Cells

**Intrinsic Resistance Properties**

CSCs are reported to be highly resistant to the current chemotherapeutic agents. Currently available chemotherapeutic agents mainly target proliferating cancer cells and are unable to eliminate CSCs. The entire mechanism of chemoresistance in CSC is cryptic but recent researches clarified part of this picture.

They are also capable of differentiating into metabolically and functionally diverse subclones within a single tumor. Moreover, they are usually resistant to many therapeutic methods due to their undifferentiated state. This fact is supported by findings suggesting that more differentiated cancer stem cells tend to lead to better prognoses due to their decreased tumorigenic potential.

**Enhanced DNA Repair Mechanisms**

CSCs often exhibit enhanced DNA repair capacity, allowing them to survive DNA-damaging treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This enhanced repair ability contributes to their resistance to conventional cytotoxic therapies.

**Metabolic Adaptations**

CSCs demonstrate metabolic plasticity that allows them to survive in harsh microenvironmental conditions, including hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and the presence of therapeutic agents. This metabolic flexibility contributes to their survival advantage during treatment.

## 15.3.2 Drug Efflux Mechanisms

**ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporters**

Side population cells are reported to express high level of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Expression levels of ABC transporters in cancer cells determine chemoresistant phenotype since chemotherapeutic agents such as etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine and paclitaxel are direct substrates of ABC transporters.

ATP binding cassette (ABC)-containing drug efflux transporters play important roles in regulating intracellular drug concentrations that determine cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Of particular relevance to cancer chemotherapy are the transporters P-glycoprotein (Pgp) encoded by multidrug resistance 1 gene, multidrug resistance protein (MRP), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).

**Multidrug Resistance Proteins**

More than 80% of currently used antitumor agents can be transported by these three transporters, and overexpression of these transporters renders multidrug resistance to a broad spectrum of antitumor agents. Side population cells in pancreatic cancer also express ABCB1 and ABCG2 which play important role in chemoresistance of tumors in other organs.

Limited or prevented access of targeted tumor cells to chemotherapeutics drugs often result in the development of drug resistance. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein family members are located at the plasma membrane and use ATP as an energy source to effectively pump drugs out of the cell.

## 15.3.3 Treatment-Induced Selection Pressure

**Chemotherapy-Induced CSC Enrichment**

Another report indicated that conventional chemotherapy itself could propagate the CSC population in pancreatic cancer. Long-term culture of pancreatic cancer cell line L3.6pl and AsPC-1 with increasing doses of gemcitabine enhances the CD24/CD44/ESA triple positive CSC fraction.

These observations indicate that conventional therapies could create selective pressure for more malignant phenotype of cancer cells. While certain subpopulations with defined metabolic phenotypes may be sensitive to a suitable metabolic inhibitor, other subclones with different metabolic phenotypes may well be resistant to that drug.

**Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)**

These cells also revealed spindle-shaped appearance and decreased expression of E-cadherin which are the specific features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) suggesting the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype.

## 15.3.4 Resistance Mechanisms in Different Cancer Types

**Hepatocellular Carcinoma**

Although there has been tremendous progress in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma over the past decades, multidrug resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy remains a major hindrance in its successful management. Multidrug resistance, whether intrinsic or extrinsic, is a multifactorial process that includes enhanced drug efflux, decreased drug uptake, intracellular sequestration, metabolic alterations, aberrant apoptotic and autophagic signaling, changes in tumor microenvironment, and acquisition of stem cell-like properties by the cancer cells.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of tumor cells with the capacity of self-renewal, differentiation, as well as drug resistance. CD133+ HCC cells isolated from human HCC cell lines and xenograft mouse models were resistant to chemotherapeutics, through the activation of Akt/PKB and Bcl-2 pathways.

**Breast Cancer**

Over the past several decades, breast cancer survival rates have significantly improved. However, the response rates remain suboptimal. Moreover, few effective therapeutic regimens are available to treat those had been exposed to anthracyclines or failed to anthracycline treatments. These observations underscore the importance of multidrug resistance in breast cancer chemotherapy.

**Pancreatic Cancer**

Pancreatic cancer is a characteristic cancer by its dismal prognosis and resistance against conventional therapies such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The reasons for resistance against conventional therapy and re-growth of untreatable tumor are now attributed to the existence of cancer stem cells (CSC), which occupy only a small part of the entire cancer tissue.

## 15.3.5 Overcoming Treatment Resistance

**Targeting CSC-Specific Pathways**

Multi-signal pathways and their cross-talk, including EpCAM, Wnt/Î²-catenin, Sonic Hedgehog, and Notch, are required to maintain the stemness phenotype of HCC CSCs. Targeting these pathways represents a promising approach to overcome CSC-mediated resistance.

**Combination Therapy Approaches**

The recognition of tumor heterogeneity has led to the development of combination therapy approaches that target multiple cellular populations simultaneously. Rather than relying on single-agent therapy, combination regimens aim to address both CSCs and differentiated cancer cells.

**Immunotherapy and CSCs**

Growing evidence has suggested that lack of eradication of the malignant stem cell forms the basis for cancer relapse and progression. These data set the stage for newer approaches that focus on immune targeting of antigens that are present on the cancer stem cell.

Rational immune targeting of the tumor-initiating population critically depends on (1) identifying the unique surface markers of these cells so that they may be isolated, and on (2) defining antigens that are uniquely or preferentially expressed within the malignant cells with stem-cell like functions compared to normal cells.
