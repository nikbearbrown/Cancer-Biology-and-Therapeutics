title: 15.2 Tumor Heterogeneity and Clonal Evolution
---


Tumor heterogeneity represents one of the most significant challenges in cancer treatment and represents a fundamental characteristic that distinguishes malignant from benign neoplasms. Simply put, what makes cancer one of the deadliest diseases is its ability to change and adapt. Cancer cells' rapid evolution, coupled with their irrepressible ability to divide, gives most of them the advantage over our immune systems.

## 15.2.1 Types of Tumor Heterogeneity

**Intertumoral Heterogeneity**

Intertumoral heterogeneity refers to the differences observed between tumors of the same histological type arising in different patients. This type of heterogeneity explains why patients with seemingly identical cancers can have dramatically different responses to the same treatment regimen.

Genomic profiling of clinical samples across cancers has detailed the genomic underpinnings, suggested new cancer subtypes, and identified therapeutic targets that can be treated with available therapies or used to develop new drugs and therapies. Additionally, it has revealed high levels of intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity.

**Intratumoral Heterogeneity**

Intratumoral heterogeneity, referring to the variations among different tumor lesions and/or tumor cells within a single patient, is largely driven by genomic instability. Unstable genome in tumor cells leads to the occurrence of a wide range of mutations and, as such, fosters genetic diversity and the generation of genetically different cancer cell clones.

A recent study noted the coexistence of various genetically different subclones in advanced tumors, challenging the previously held notion that a dominant subclone usually appears in a given tumor. Furthermore, based on the expression of 110 genes, another study showed that different subpopulations in one clear cell carcinoma could be classified as either clear cell A (associated with good prognosis) or B (associated with poor prognosis).

**Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneity**

Additionally, it is worthy of note that intratumoral heterogeneity is not only limited to the uneven distribution of tumor clones across various lesions but also includes the dynamic changes of a given lesion (also termed as temporal heterogeneity).

Using whole-genome sequencing to analyze 43 tumor lesions from 10 HCC patients, Xue et al. showed that all the patients in this cohort presented with evidence of intratumoral heterogeneity. Importantly, the extent of intratumoral heterogeneity varied among different patients.

## 15.2.2 Molecular Mechanisms of Tumor Heterogeneity

**Genomic Instability**

As a tumor expands or develops metastasis, these clones would compete for survival, leading to clonal evolution of a given lesion or host. Therefore, the architecture of tumor lesion is determined by a framework composed of clonal evolution, competition, and best-fit selection.

The trillions of cells in a human slowly but steadily accumulate heritable change. Those heritable changes evolve in a spatially mosaic way. A few tissue patches may be advanced, poised to pass the next step to disease. Other tissue patches may be in an early stage, apparently normal but silently one step closer to malfunction.

**Epigenetic Alterations**

Epigenetics alterations lead to intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity. The complexity of genotype and epigenetic states creates the intratumoral heterogeneity of metabolism. Recent work on epigenetic processes shows that heritable genomic changes often accumulate by DNA methylation and histone modification. Tumors frequently have elevated rates of epigenetic change, providing another pathway to increase the rate of progression.

**Mutational Processes**

Some authors emphasize hypermutation, in which an early step of carcinogenesis reduces DNA repair efficacy or promotes chromosomal aberrations during cell division. Once the caretakers of genomic integrity have been damaged, subsequent changes may accumulate relatively rapidly.

## 15.2.3 Theories of Tumor Heterogeneity

**Clonal Evolution Model**

Heterogeneity is a hallmark of cancer. Clonal evolution theory and cancer stem cell theory explain tumor subpopulation growth. The clonal evolution theory claims that genetically and metabolically distinct subpopulations arise from a previously larger population of cancer cells due to the expansion of the population, genetic diversification, and selection of certain subclones over others.

There are currently two proposed models that lead to tumor heterogeneity. The first model suggests that heterogeneity stems from clonal evolution, where there are changes in single cells that create survival advantages between clonal populations.

**Cancer Stem Cell Model**

On the other hand, the CSC theory states that a significant source of heterogeneity in cancer cells is due to CSCs, which are undifferentiated and have high rates of division. These cancer stem cells possess largely variable metabolic phenotypes through their differentiation into different types of cells.

The second model relies on cancer stem cells to produce phenotypically diverse differentiated cells. These models are not mutually exclusive as the cancer stem cells have the opportunity to undergo clonal evolution for them to evolve into more aggressive, self-renewing stem cells.

## 15.2.4 Clonal Evolution and Progression

**Multistage Progression**

Several checks prevent uncontrolled proliferation of cells. Normal cells commit suicide when they cannot pass various quality control tests; a built-in counting mechanism limits the number of times a cell can divide; structural rigidity and physical partitions in tissues prevent expansion of abnormal cellular clones.

**Field Cancerization**

Fields of p53 mutants have been observed in the bladder. The concept of field cancerization suggests that localized tumors may emerge from a broader precancerous field. Subsequent work on "field cancerization" almost always assumes that the field grows by clonal expansion of a mutated cell in the fully developed organism.

**Metastatic Evolution**

Alternatively, migrant cells may arise at different stages of tumor development or from different lineages in late-stage tumors. In this case, the time back to common ancestors for colonist cells and the cells in the primary tumor would be variable; metastases derived from colonists would be genetically heterogeneous.
