title: 15.1 Concept and Characteristics of Cancer Stem Cells
---


Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a revolutionary concept in cancer biology that has fundamentally changed our understanding of tumor initiation, progression, and treatment resistance. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are defined as cells with self-renewal ability, tumor-initiating capacity, and the ability to give rise to more differentiated progeny. Though the frequency of these cells may vary among various kinds of tumors, they often represent a minor subset of tumor cells endowed exclusively with tumor-initiating ability.

## 15.1.1 Historical Context and Conceptual Foundation

The concept of cancer stem cells emerged from observations that only a small fraction of cells within a tumor could initiate new tumors when transplanted. Recent research has uncovered that tissue patterning of normal organ development requires normal tissue stem cells to give rise to a wide variety of cells. These normal tissue stem cells are capable of self-renewal while providing progenitor cells for asymmetrical division.

The CSC concept was established as a counterpart to normal tissue stem cells. As shown in figure 1, normal tissue stem cells give rise to various types of cells. In contrast, CSC has self-renewal capacity and manifests several characteristics such as initiation of metastasis, chemoresistance, and hierarchical reconstitution of the entire tumor.

**Terminology and Definitions**

Critics argue that since the origin of CSCs is not clearly understood and CSCs do not always seem to be originating from normal stem cells, the usage of the term CSC leads to ambiguity and confusion. Instead, the term tumor-initiating cell (TIC) has been suggested since seeding the growth of a tumor is one of the defining properties of CSCs.

However, originally the term 'cancer stem cell' was not coined based on the cancerous cell-of-origin, but rather due to similarities between stem cells and CSCs in terms of their ability to self renew, regenerate organs/tumors and give rise to more differentiated progeny. Hence, here onwards, the terms cancer stem cell (CSC) and tumor-initiating cell (TIC) will be used interchangeably.

## 15.1.2 Defining Characteristics of Cancer Stem Cells

**Self-Renewal and Differentiation Capacity**

Cancer stem cells possess the fundamental stem cell properties of self-renewal and multipotent differentiation. Unlike normal stem cells that contribute to tissue homeostasis, CSCs drive tumor growth and progression through dysregulated self-renewal mechanisms that favor expansion over differentiation.

**Tumor-Initiating Capacity**

According to the original definition of CSC, a cell can be classified as a CSC only when it is prospectively isolated and implanted into an immunocompromised mouse to show that the cell can induce serially transplantable tumors. This functional definition emphasizes the unique ability of CSCs to initiate tumor formation with relatively few cells compared to the bulk tumor population.

**Hierarchical Organization**

Currently the CSC phenotype can be summarized by its tumorigenicity, chemoresistance, metastatic ability and reconstruction of hierarchy. These characteristics were based on the resultant cancer cell behavior after the isolation of specific population from entire cancer cells.

A small number of CSCs can reconstruct the entire cancer tissue, leading to the recurrence after surgery. The hierarchical model suggests that CSCs sit at the apex of a cellular hierarchy, giving rise to various differentiated cancer cell types that constitute the bulk of the tumor.

## 15.1.3 Molecular Markers for Cancer Stem Cell Identification

**Marker-Based Identification Strategies**

CSCs in various cancers are mainly identified using cell-surface markers expressed on corresponding normal stem cells. Several methods have been proposed to identify, isolate and characterize CSCs. The two main strategies that are employed for the detection and characterization of CSCs include marker-dependent (or marker-based) and marker-independent strategies.

**Specific Markers in Different Cancer Types**

**Hematopoietic Malignancies:**
In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the CD34+CD38− marker combination was used to identify AML CSC, and the same combination also identifies normal HSCs. Genetic studies performed over 20 years ago demonstrated that the malignant clone in CML is a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell, capable of differentiating into myeloid cells, monocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets.

**Breast Cancer:**
In solid tumors, CSCs were initially identified in breast cancer (BCa) using a CD44+CD24− marker combination; these CD44+CD24− cells were purified from BCa samples using FACS and shown to possess stem cell properties. Al-Hajj et al. reported that CD24−/low/CD44+ fractions from metastatic pleural effusions and a primary invasive breast tumor had higher tumorigenic potential when injected into the mammary fat pad of female NOD/SCID mice than CD24+/CD44+/− cell fractions.

**Pancreatic Cancer:**
In pancreatic cancer, several CSC markers such as CD24/CD44/ESA triple positive or CD133 are identified and these CSC fractions revealed higher tumorigenicity, metastatic capability. The CD24/CD44/ESA triple positive cell population isolated from the surgical specimen also depicted the increased tumorigenicity in another study. The CD133/Prominin positive cell population revealed the capability to reconstruct the hierarchical population of tumor cells in an orthotopic implantation model.

**Hepatocellular Carcinoma:**
CSC markers of HCC include epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), CD133, CD90, CD44, CD24, CD13, deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22), and oval cell marker OV6. Some of these markers have been reported to confer chemoresistance to HCC.

## 15.1.4 Marker-Independent Identification Methods

**Side Population Analysis**

Side population (SP), a marker-independent strategy, was originally used to enrich normal HSC and leukemia SC but was later used extensively to enrich CSCs in several solid tumors. SP technique is based on the ability of stem cells to exclude Hoechst dye 33342 and appear as a side population compared with the normal differentiated cells, which take up the dye and appear as the main population.

For example, side population cell is defined by the ability to excrete Hoechst dye from cell and identified as a hematopoietic stem cell marker. Side population cells from pancreatic cancer cell lines also contain CSC fraction evidenced by increased tumorigenicity and chemoresistance.

**ABC Transporter Expression**

The ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family proteins such as MDR1 and ABCG2 are responsible for dye exclusion and the side population phenotypic profile. These markers are highly expressed on normal as well as CSCs and usually SP population overlaps with CSCs in several cancers.

For example, LAPC9, a prostate cancer (PCa) xenograft tumor, was found to have 0.1% SP cells; when these cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice, they were found to be highly tumorigenic (100-1000 times higher) compared with non-SP cells.
