## 22.1.1 Historical Development and Basic Principles

The term "chemotherapy" was coined by German chemist Paul Ehrlich, who investigated the use of drugs to treat infectious diseases and was the first scientist to study animal models to screen chemicals for potential activity against diseases. The development of cancer chemotherapy began with three pivotal events in the last century: the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen, the use of transplantable animal-tumor models in cancer research, and the first surgical procedure developed by Halsted (radical mastectomy).

Historical documents suggest the use of arsenicals started in the 1900s, with radiotherapy and surgery being the mainstays of cancer management in the 1960s. As micrometastases and the recurrence of cancer after surgery and radiation therapy became evident, combination chemotherapy started gaining significance. The publication of the Lindskog article suggesting nitrogen mustard's success in treating lymphoma had a considerable initial effect on the development of cancer chemotherapy, including oral derivatives like chlorambucil and, ultimately, cyclophosphamide.

## 22.1.2 Fundamental Mechanisms of Cytotoxicity

Chemotherapy aims to inhibit cell proliferation and tumor multiplication, thus avoiding invasion and metastasis. Traditional chemotherapy agents primarily affect either macromolecular synthesis and function of neoplastic cells by interfering with DNA, RNA, or protein synthesis or affecting the appropriate functioning of preformed molecules.

**Direct Cytotoxic Effects:**
When interference in macromolecular synthesis or function is sufficient, it leads to cell death due to the chemotherapeutic agent's direct effect or by triggering apoptosis. With traditional agents, cell death may be delayed as many cells die due to a given treatment, requiring repeated administration to achieve a response.

**Cell Cycle Specificity:**
The toxicity of cytotoxic drugs is most significant during the S phase, as it is the DNA synthetic phase of the cell cycle. Vinca alkaloids and Taxanes act in the M phase and block mitotic spindle formation. The concept of cell cycle specificity has led to the classification of drugs based on their preferential destruction effect in different phases of the cell cycle.

## 22.1.3 Combination Chemotherapy Principles

Combination chemotherapy is based on three fundamental principles that guide treatment design:

**Fraction Kill Hypothesis:**
A uniform drug dose kills a constant fraction of tumor cells rather than a constant number regardless of tumor burden. This concept suggests that multiple cycles of treatment are necessary to achieve maximal tumor cell kill.

**Linear Dose-Response Relationship:**
Neoplastic tumor cells have a linear response between the dose and efficacy, indicating that higher doses (within tolerable limits) may provide greater therapeutic benefit.

**Goldie-Coldman Hypothesis:**
Cancer cells acquire spontaneous mutations that cause drug resistance. Therefore, multitargeted or combination therapy is superior to single-agent therapy in most cancer treatments. Additionally, combination chemotherapy agents with different mechanisms of action and nonoverlapping toxicities can be chosen to decrease resistance and toxicities.

## 22.1.4 Cellular Targets and Mechanisms

Inhibition of tumor growth can occur at several levels within the cell and its environment. The mechanisms of cell kill of several antineoplastic drugs involve interactions between the drug and essential intracellular enzymes, resulting in alteration or inhibition of normal functions. These cellular mechanisms that promote or suppress cell proliferation and differentiation are intricate, involving several genes, receptors, and signal transduction pathways.

**DNA as Primary Target:**
Most chemotherapeutic agents ultimately target DNA replication, transcription, or repair processes. The drugs can cause direct DNA damage, interfere with DNA synthesis, or disrupt the cellular machinery responsible for DNA maintenance.

**Apoptosis Induction:**
Many chemotherapeutic agents trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis) through various pathways, including p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. The ability to induce apoptosis is crucial for the therapeutic efficacy of many anticancer drugs.
