title: 22.5 Side Effects and Supportive Care
---



## 22.5.1 General Principles of Chemotherapy Toxicity

Chemotherapeutic agents are commonly associated with side effects that usually reflect their mechanism of action. Cytotoxic chemotherapy targets DNA and protein expression in both cancer and normal host cells, resulting in a very narrow therapeutic index. Most chemotherapy drugs show activity in rapidly multiplying cells, affecting bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, and hair follicles.

**Classification of Toxicities:**
- **Acute toxicities:** Occur within days to weeks of treatment
- **Chronic toxicities:** Develop over months to years
- **Delayed toxicities:** May appear years after treatment completion

## 22.5.2 Hematologic Toxicity

**Myelosuppression:**
The most common dose-limiting toxicity of chemotherapy, affecting bone marrow production of blood cells.

- **Neutropenia:** Increased risk of bacterial infections; nadir typically occurs 6-10 days after treatment with recovery in 14-21 days
- **Thrombocytopenia:** Bleeding risk; requires monitoring and potential platelet transfusion
- **Anemia:** Fatigue and decreased oxygen-carrying capacity

**Management Strategies:**
- Growth factor support (G-CSF for neutropenia)
- Prophylactic antibiotics in high-risk patients
- Blood product transfusions when necessary
- Dose modifications based on blood counts

## 22.5.3 Gastrointestinal Toxicity

**Nausea and Vomiting:**
Among the most feared side effects by patients, can significantly impact quality of life and treatment compliance.

**Management Options:**
- **5-HT3 antagonists:** ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron
- **NK1 antagonists:** aprepitant, fosaprepitant
- **Corticosteroids:** dexamethasone
- **Dopamine antagonists:** prochlorperazine, metoclopramide
- **Benzodiazepines:** lorazepam for anticipatory nausea

**Mucositis:**
Inflammation and ulceration of mucous membranes, particularly affecting the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract.

**Management:**
- Oral hygiene maintenance
- Topical analgesics and protective agents
- Avoidance of commercial mouthwashes and lemon glycerin swabs
- Nutritional support when severe

## 22.5.4 Organ-Specific Toxicities

**Cardiotoxicity:**
Particularly associated with anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin), which can cause both acute and chronic cardiomyopathy.

- **Acute effects:** Arrhythmias, pericarditis
- **Chronic effects:** Dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure
- **Monitoring:** Baseline and periodic echocardiograms or MUGA scans
- **Cumulative dose limits:** Lifetime maximum dose of 550 mg/mÂ² for doxorubicin

**Pulmonary Toxicity:**
- **Bleomycin:** Pulmonary fibrosis (cumulative dose-dependent)
- **Carmustine:** Interstitial pneumonitis
- **Monitoring:** Pulmonary function tests, chest imaging

**Nephrotoxicity:**
- **Cisplatin:** Acute tubular necrosis, chronic kidney disease
- **Prevention:** Adequate hydration, magnesium and potassium supplementation
- **Monitoring:** Serum creatinine, electrolytes, urinalysis

**Hepatotoxicity:**
- **Methotrexate:** Hepatic fibrosis with chronic use
- **Monitoring:** Liver function tests, consideration of liver biopsy with prolonged use

## 22.5.5 Neurologic Toxicity

**Peripheral Neuropathy:**
Common with several drug classes, particularly taxanes, platinum compounds, and vinca alkaloids.

**Management:**
- **Dose modifications:** Reduction or discontinuation based on severity
- **Supportive care:** Vitamin B6, gabapentin, pregabalin
- **Neuroprotective agents:** Limited evidence for various agents

**Central Nervous System Toxicity:**
- **High-dose cytarabine:** Cerebellar dysfunction, encephalopathy
- **Methotrexate:** Leukoencephalopathy, especially with intrathecal administration

## 22.5.6 Secondary Malignancies

Long-term survivors of chemotherapy face an increased risk of secondary malignancies, particularly:

- **Acute leukemia:** Associated with alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors
- **Solid tumors:** Risk varies by treatment received and patient factors
- **Latency period:** Typically 5-7 years for treatment-related leukemia, longer for solid tumors

## 22.5.7 Reproductive and Endocrine Effects

**Infertility:**
- **Gonadal toxicity:** Particularly with alkylating agents
- **Preservation options:** Sperm banking, egg harvesting, ovarian tissue cryopreservation
- **Hormonal effects:** Premature menopause, testosterone deficiency

## 22.5.8 Supportive Care Measures

**Infection Prevention:**
- Hand hygiene and isolation protocols
- Prophylactic antimicrobials in high-risk patients
- Monitoring for signs of infection during neutropenia

**Nutritional Support:**
- Adequate protein and caloric intake
- Vitamin and mineral supplementation
- Parenteral nutrition when necessary

**Psychosocial Support:**
- Management of anxiety and depression
- Patient education and counseling
- Support groups and social services

## 22.5.9 Management of Specific Toxicities

**Extravasation of Vesicants:**
Vesicants are drugs that can cause tissue necrosis if they infiltrate from the vein into subcutaneous tissue.

**Management Protocol:**
1. Stop vesicant administration immediately
2. Aspirate residual medication
3. Remove intravenous cannula
4. Apply cold or hot packs based on specific drug
5. Elevate affected limb
6. Consider surgical consultation for severe cases

**Temperature-Specific Management:**
- **Cold pack:** doxorubicin, daunorubicin, mitomycin-C
- **Hot pack:** vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine

**Tumor Lysis Syndrome:**
Potentially life-threatening complication of treatment of rapidly proliferating tumors.

**Prevention:**
- Adequate hydration
- Allopurinol or rasburicase prophylaxis
- Monitoring of electrolytes and renal function
