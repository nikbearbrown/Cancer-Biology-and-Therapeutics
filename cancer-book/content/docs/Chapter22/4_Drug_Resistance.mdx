## 22.4.1 Types of Drug Resistance

Drug resistance represents one of the major challenges in cancer chemotherapy and can be classified into several categories:

**Intrinsic vs. Acquired Resistance:**
- **Intrinsic resistance:** Natural resistance of tumor cells against chemotherapeutic drugs at the onset of treatment
- **Acquired resistance:** Development of resistance during cancer treatment, where tumor cells initially sensitive to the drug develop resistance

**Primary vs. Secondary Resistance:**
- **Primary resistance:** Resistance before drug exposure
- **Secondary resistance:** Resistance after exposure to a drug

## 22.4.2 Mechanisms of Drug Resistance

Multiple mechanisms contribute to chemotherapy resistance, often operating simultaneously within the same tumor:

**Altered Drug Transport:**
- **Decreased uptake:** Downregulation of drug influx mechanisms, such as the reduced folate carrier for methotrexate
- **Increased efflux:** Overexpression of drug efflux pumps, particularly P-glycoprotein (MDR1), which belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily

**Drug Metabolism Alterations:**
- **Decreased activation:** Reduced conversion of prodrugs to active metabolites
- **Increased inactivation:** Enhanced drug detoxification through enzymes like glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)

**Target Alterations:**
- **Quantitative changes:** Altered expression levels of drug targets (e.g., increased dihydrofolate reductase in methotrexate resistance)
- **Qualitative changes:** Mutations in drug targets that reduce drug binding affinity

**DNA Repair Enhancement:**
Enhanced DNA repair mechanisms can counteract drug-induced DNA damage. Elevated expressions of repair system genes are often associated with chemotherapy resistance and represent potential molecular targets for overcoming resistance.

**Apoptosis Inhibition:**
- **Anti-apoptotic proteins:** Overexpression of proteins like Bcl-2 that prevent programmed cell death
- **Cell death pathway disruption:** Alterations in p53 and other apoptosis-regulating pathways

## 22.4.3 Multidrug Resistance (MDR)

Multidrug resistance refers to the simultaneous resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action. This phenomenon is particularly problematic in cancer treatment as it can render multiple therapeutic options ineffective.

**Classic MDR:**
Mediated primarily by P-glycoprotein overexpression, which pumps various structurally unrelated drugs out of the cell, including anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, and taxanes.

**Atypical MDR:**
Involving other transport proteins such as multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which have different substrate specificities.

## 22.4.4 Clinical Implications and Strategies

**Tumor Heterogeneity:**
The Goldie-Coldman hypothesis states that every tumor cell has a variable degree of resistance directly proportional to the tumor size. This concept explains why combination chemotherapy is often more effective than single-agent therapy.

**Resistance Prevention Strategies:**
- Use of combination chemotherapy with different mechanisms of action
- Alternating or sequential treatment regimens
- Dose intensification within tolerable limits
- Development of resistance modulators or chemosensitizers
