## 22.3.1 Drug Administration and Absorption

Chemotherapy agents can be administered orally, intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intrathecally. Most chemotherapy agents are administered intravenously because of their 100% absorption rate. Some compounds, like paclitaxel, are poorly soluble and need to be mixed with solvents like cremophor for better absorption.

**Factors Affecting Absorption:**
- Surgical procedures and gastric motility, especially important in cancer patients using opioids
- First-pass metabolism (significant for oral agents like cytarabine)
- Drug formulation and delivery systems

## 22.3.2 Distribution and Metabolism

Most chemotherapy agents are metabolized and excreted by the liver or kidneys. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system metabolizes various chemotherapeutic drugs. Drugs like bortezomib, docetaxel, etoposide, imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, and vinca alkaloids are metabolized by CYP3A4/5.

**Dosing Considerations:**
Chemotherapy agents are generally administered using body surface area dosing, which accounts for individual patient variations in size and metabolic capacity. Dose adjustments are essential for patients with organ dysfunction, particularly hepatic or renal impairment.

## 22.3.3 Drug-Drug Interactions

Drug-drug interactions are common and clinically significant in chemotherapy. It is imperative to be aware of common drugs that are strong inducers (like phenobarbital and phenytoin) and inhibitors of CYP enzymes (like grapefruit juice and ketoconazole), since these can alter drug levels and either decrease efficacy or increase toxicity.

**Transport Mechanisms:**
Many chemotherapeutic agents rely on specific transport systems for cellular uptake. For example, methotrexate utilizes folate transport systems, and resistance can develop through downregulation of these uptake mechanisms.

## 22.3.4 Pharmacokinetic Principles

**Tissue Pharmacology:**
For anticancer drugs, tissue pharmacology is much more relevant than plasma studies, and blood studies cannot be easily extrapolated to what occurs at the tissue level. The critical factor is the concentration × time (C×T) of the active drug at the level of tumor cells, not necessarily plasma C×T.

**Elimination Pathways:**
Different chemotherapeutic agents have varying elimination pathways:
- Renal elimination: requires dose adjustment in kidney disease (e.g., cisplatin, methotrexate)
- Hepatic metabolism: requires dose adjustment in liver disease (e.g., doxorubicin, paclitaxel)
- Biliary excretion: important for some agents like irinotecan
