## 22.2.1 Alkylating Agents

Alkylating agents were the first nonhormonal drugs to be used effectively in the treatment of cancer. The development of these agents began with the observation that troops and civilians exposed to sulfur mustard during World War I developed bone marrow suppression and lymphoid aplasia, leading to the evaluation of related nitrogen mustards as antitumor agents.

**Mechanism of Action:**
These drugs yield an unstable alkyl group (R-CH2+) that reacts with nucleophilic centers on proteins and nucleic acids. Alkylating agents substitute alkyl groups for hydrogen atoms on DNA, resulting in the formation of cross-links within the DNA chain and thereby causing cytotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic effects. This action occurs in all cells, but alkylating agents have their primary effect on rapidly dividing cells which do not have time for DNA repair.

**Classification and Examples:**
- **Nitrogen mustards:** bendamustine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide
- **Nitrosoureas:** carmustine, lomustine  
- **Platinum analogs:** carboplatin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin
- **Triazenes:** dacarbazine, procarbazine, temozolomide
- **Alkyl sulfonates:** busulfan
- **Ethyleneimines:** thiotepa

**Clinical Applications:**
The alkylating agents are used across a wide spectrum of malignancies. Cisplatin, for example, is FDA approved for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, testicular cancer, and bladder carcinoma, and is frequently used off-label for numerous other malignancies.

## 22.2.2 Antimetabolites

Antimetabolites are structural analogs of naturally occurring metabolites involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. The development of pyrimidine and purine analogs as potential antineoplastic agents evolved from the early presumption that nucleic acids are involved in growth control.

**Mechanism of Action:**
Antimetabolites inhibit DNA replication by interfering with nucleotide synthesis or by being incorporated into DNA or RNA, causing chain termination or miscoding. They act as "false" substrates for enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism.

**Major Subclasses:**

**A) Folate Antagonists:**
- **Examples:** methotrexate, pemetrexed
- **Mechanism:** Inhibit dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of dihydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate, the active form of folic acid. Tetrahydrofolate is necessary to synthesize nucleotides of both DNA and RNA.
- **Clinical Use:** Methotrexate for ALL, NHL, CNS tumors, sarcoma; pemetrexed for malignant pleural mesothelioma, NSCLC (non-squamous)

**B) Purine Analogs:**
- **Examples:** cladribine, clofarabine, fludarabine, nelarabine, pentostatin
- **Mechanism:** Structural analogs of guanine and adenine that act as false metabolites
- **Clinical Use:** Cladribine for hairy cell leukemia; fludarabine for CLL; nelarabine for T-ALL

**C) Pyrimidine Analogs:**
- **Examples:** fluorouracil (5-FU), capecitabine, cytarabine, gemcitabine
- **Mechanism:** Cytarabine is converted into the triphosphate form within the cell and competes with cytidine to incorporate itself into DNA, causing DNA replication to cease. 5-FU's active metabolite forms a stable covalent complex with thymidine synthetase.
- **Clinical Use:** 5-FU for colorectal, anal, pancreatic, gastric cancers; cytarabine for AML; gemcitabine for pancreatic, lung, breast, ovarian cancers

## 22.2.3 Topoisomerase Inhibitors

Topoisomerase I and II are normal host enzymes found in the nucleus of mammalian cells and are required for normal DNA replication and cellular division. These enzymes create and then repair single-stranded nicks in cellular DNA, allowing for the untangling and relaxation of supercoiled double-stranded DNA so that replication can proceed.

**Topoisomerase I Inhibitors:**
- **Examples:** irinotecan, topotecan
- **Mechanism:** Prevent relegation by blocking the release of topoisomerase I from the cleavable complex, forming a ternary complex that prevents resealing of DNA breaks
- **Clinical Use:** Irinotecan for colorectal, cervical, esophageal, pancreatic, lung cancers; topotecan for cervical, ovarian, small cell lung cancer
- **Derivation:** Derived from camptothecins, cytotoxic compounds initially isolated from the bark of the Chinese tree, Camptotheca acuminata

**Topoisomerase II Inhibitors:**
- **Examples:** etoposide, teniposide (epipodophyllotoxins); doxorubicin, daunorubicin (anthracyclines)
- **Mechanism:** Bind to topoisomerase II and DNA, preventing the resealing of DNA breaks and thus causing inhibition of DNA replication and cell death
- **Clinical Use:** Etoposide for testicular cancer, small cell lung cancer, lymphomas; anthracyclines for leukemias, lymphomas, breast cancer, sarcomas
- **Derivation:** Epipodophyllotoxins are semisynthetic derivatives of podophyllotoxin, an extract from the American mandrake plant

## 22.2.4 Antimicrotubule Agents

These agents target the microtubule system, which is essential for cell division, intracellular transport, and maintenance of cell shape.

**Taxanes:**
- **Examples:** paclitaxel, docetaxel, cabazitaxel
- **Mechanism:** Disrupt the equilibrium of polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules, causing abnormal cellular function and disruption of replication leading to apoptosis. They stabilize microtubules and inhibit their disassembly.
- **Clinical Use:** Paclitaxel for breast, lung, ovarian cancers; docetaxel for breast, lung, prostate, ovarian cancers

**Vinca Alkaloids:**
- **Examples:** vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine
- **Mechanism:** Bind to tubulin, inhibit microtubule formation, and arrest cells in metaphase (M-phase specific)
- **Clinical Use:** Vincristine for ALL, Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL, neuroblastoma; vinblastine for lymphomas, testicular cancer

## 22.2.5 Antitumor Antibiotics

These naturally occurring compounds were originally isolated from various microorganisms and have been found to have significant antineoplastic activity.

**Examples:** actinomycin D, bleomycin, daunomycin, doxorubicin, mitomycin
**Mechanism:** Inhibit RNA and DNA synthesis through various mechanisms including DNA intercalation, generation of free radicals, and DNA strand breaks
**Clinical Applications:** Bleomycin for testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck cancers; doxorubicin for various solid tumors and hematologic malignancies
