title: 1.6 Tissue Organization and Organ Systems
---


Many organisms, such as bacteria, amoebas, and yeasts, consist of single cells that are capable of independent self-replication. More complex organisms are composed of collections of cells that function in a coordinated manner, with different cells specialized to perform particular tasks.

Cells in multicellular organisms are organized into tissues, which combine to form organs and organ systems. This hierarchical organization enables the specialization and coordination necessary for complex physiological functions.
