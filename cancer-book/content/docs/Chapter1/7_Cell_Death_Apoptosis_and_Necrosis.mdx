title: 1.7 Cell Death - Apoptosis and Necrosis
---



Apoptosis, first identified in the 1970s, was initially perceived as a process comparable to mitosis. Commonly referred to as programmed cell death, it plays an essential role in maintaining a balance with mitosis by regulating cell populations during development, preserving tissue homeostasis in adults, and contributing to various biological processes.

## 1.7.1 Apoptosis: Programmed Cell Death

The cells of a multicellular organism are members of a highly organized community. The number of cells in this community is tightly regulatedâ€”not simply by controlling the rate of cell division, but also by controlling the rate of cell death. If cells are no longer needed, they commit suicide by activating an intracellular death program. This process is therefore called programmed cell death, although it is more commonly called apoptosis.

The amount of apoptosis that occurs in developing and adult animal tissues can be astonishing. In the developing vertebrate nervous system, for example, up to half or more of the nerve cells normally die soon after they are formed. In a healthy adult human, billions of cells die in the bone marrow and intestine every hour.

Apoptosis comes from the Greek word for the natural processes of leaves falling from trees or petals from flowers. It is active and can be evolutionarily selected. The other type of cell death, necrosis, is a pathological death caused by external factors such as inflammation or toxic injury.

### Molecular Mechanisms of Apoptosis

All the pathways involve the activation of caspases as the final step. The intrinsic pathway is activated when the cell experiences internal stress due to various factors such as DNA damage from x-ray or UV light exposure, chemotherapeutic agents, hypoxia, or the accumulation of misfolded proteins inside the cell.

The extrinsic pathway is triggered when the cell receives death signals from other cells. This pathway is receptor-linked, and the ligands from the other cells bind to these death receptors on the cell surface, activating apoptosis.

In the best understood pathway, mitochondria are induced to release the electron carrier protein cytochrome c into the cytosol, where it binds and activates an adaptor protein called Apaf-1. This mitochondrial pathway of procaspase activation is recruited in most forms of apoptosis to initiate or to accelerate and amplify the caspase cascade.

### Regulation of Apoptosis

The Bcl-2 family of intracellular proteins helps regulate the activation of procaspases. Some members of this family, like Bcl-2 itself or Bcl-XL, inhibit apoptosis, at least partly by blocking the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Other members of the Bcl-2 family are not death inhibitors, but instead promote procaspase activation.

Regulation of programmed cell death is mediated by the integrated activity of a variety of signaling pathways, some acting to promote cell death and others acting to promote cell survival.

## 1.7.2 Necrosis: Uncontrolled Cell Death

Irreversible cell injury and eventual cell death due to pathological processes are termed necrosis. It is an uncontrolled cell death that results in swelling of the cell organelles, plasma membrane rupture and eventual lysis of the cell, and spillage of intracellular contents into the surrounding tissue leading to tissue damage.

Unlike programmed cell death known as apoptosis which generates from intrinsic signals, necrosis occurs due to overwhelming noxious stimulus from outside the cell and is almost always associated with inflammatory responses due to the release of heat shock proteins, uric acid, ATP, DNA, and nuclear proteins, which cause inflammasome activation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL1).
