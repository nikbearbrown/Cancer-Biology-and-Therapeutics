title: 1.3 The Cell Cycle - Growth, Division, and Regulation
---



The division cycle of most cells consists of four coordinated processes: cell growth, DNA replication, distribution of the duplicated chromosomes to daughter cells, and cell division. In eukaryotes, however, the cell cycle is more complex and consists of four discrete phases.

### 1.3.1 Phases of the Cell Cycle

As viewed in the microscope, the cell cycle is divided into two basic parts: mitosis and interphase. Mitosis (nuclear division) is the most dramatic stage of the cell cycle, corresponding to the separation of daughter chromosomes and usually ending with cell division (cytokinesis). However, mitosis and cytokinesis last only about an hour, so approximately 95% of the cell cycle is spent in interphaseâ€”the period between mitoses.

The timing of DNA synthesis divides the cycle of eukaryotic cells into four discrete phases. The M phase of the cycle corresponds to mitosis, which is usually followed by cytokinesis. This phase is followed by the G1 phase (gap 1), which corresponds to the interval (gap) between mitosis and initiation of DNA replication. During G1, the cell is metabolically active and continuously grows but does not replicate its DNA. G1 is followed by S phase (synthesis), during which DNA replication takes place. The completion of DNA synthesis is followed by the G2 phase (gap 2), during which cell growth continues and proteins are synthesized in preparation for mitosis.

For a typical rapidly proliferating human cell with a total cycle time of 24 hours, the G1 phase might last about 11 hours, S phase about 8 hours, G2 about 4 hours, and M about 1 hour.

### 1.3.2 Regulation of the Cell Cycle

Cyclins and Cyclin-dependent kinases, also known as CDK's, are the 2 major proteins that play a role in regulating the cell cycle. These CDK's are created throughout the cell cycle and are used to phosphorylate downstream proteins essential for healthy cell growth. On the other hand, cyclin is only created during specific times of the cell cycle and acts as a regulator.

An ordered sequence of cyclin-Cdk activities triggers most of the events of the cell cycle. During G1 phase, Cdk activity is reduced to a minimum by Cdk inhibitors (CKIs), cyclin proteolysis, and decreased cyclin gene transcription. When environmental conditions are favorable, G1- and G1/S-Cdks increase in concentration, overcoming these inhibitory barriers in late G1 and triggering the activation of S-Cdk.

The G1 checkpoint blocks progression into S phase by inhibiting the activation of G1/S-Cdk and S-Cdk complexes. In mammalian cells, for example, DNA damage leads to the activation of the gene regulatory protein p53, which stimulates the transcription of several genes. One of these genes encodes a CKI protein called p21, which binds to G1/S-Cdk and S-Cdk and inhibits their activities, thereby helping to block entry into S phase.

### 1.3.3 Cell Cycle Dysregulation in Cancer

When either of these proteins is not functioning correctly, downstream elements are not properly functioning, such as the INK4a/ARF, which encodes for tumor suppressor proteins. However, tumors may grow, leading to cancer in these specific cells.

The main tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in maintaining the cell cycle is p53, which is a transcription factor that plays a role in promoting growth arrest, DNA repair, and eventual apoptosis, or regulated death by the cell in damaging situations.
