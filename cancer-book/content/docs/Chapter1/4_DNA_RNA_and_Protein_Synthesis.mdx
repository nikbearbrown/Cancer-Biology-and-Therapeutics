### 1.4.1 DNA Structure and Organization

Although the DNA helical diameter is only 2 nm, the entire DNA strand in a single cell will stretch roughly 2 meters when completely unwound. The entire DNA strand must fit within the nucleus of a cell, so it must be very tightly packaged to fit. This is accomplished by wrapping the DNA around structural histone proteins, which act as scaffolding for the DNA to be coiled around.

The entire structure is called a nucleosome, each of which includes an octamer of histone proteins and 146 to 147 base pairs of DNA. The millions of nucleosomes tightly coil the continuous DNA strand into chromatin which is further condensed into the chromosome classically visualized during cell division.

### 1.4.2 DNA Replication

The process of replication allows cells to generate new genetic material (DNA) using original DNA as a template. The cell cycle consists of four phases-G1, S, G2, and M. During the G1 phase, cells grow and produce material like nucleotide precursors as preparation for DNA replication in the S-phase. Replication occurs in the S-phase cell and new genetic material is synthesized as a preparation for the cell division.

The process is highly regulated and requires many different enzymes that include DNA polymerases. The replication process is highly accurate, due to the proofreading ability of DNA polymerase.

Replication occurs at many origins of replication throughout the DNA strand to accelerate the replication of the entire genome, with each origin separated by approximately 100,000 base pairs. The DNA does not interact with histones during this process to allow for the propagation of the polymerase enzymes.

### 1.4.3 Transcription: From DNA to RNA

All of the RNA in a cell is made by DNA transcription, a process that has certain similarities to the process of DNA replication. Transcription begins with the opening and unwinding of a small portion of the DNA double helix to expose the bases on each DNA strand. One of the two strands of the DNA double helix then acts as a template for the synthesis of an RNA molecule.

RNA polymerase catalyzes essentially the same chemical reaction as DNA polymerase, there are some important differences between the two enzymes. First, and most obvious, RNA polymerase catalyzes the linkage of ribonucleotides, not deoxyribonucleotides. Second, unlike the DNA polymerases involved in DNA replication, RNA polymerases can start an RNA chain without a primer.

RNA synthesis requires RNA polymerase I for ribosomal RNA, RNA polymerase II for mRNA and microRNA, and RNA polymerase III for tRNA and other small RNAs. Transcription is not as accurate as replication and produces more errors.

### 1.4.4 Translation: From RNA to Protein

Transcription and translation are the means by which cells read out, or express, the genetic instructions in their genes. Because many identical RNA copies can be made from the same gene, and each RNA molecule can direct the synthesis of many identical protein molecules, cells can synthesize a large amount of protein rapidly when necessary.

Translation is the process by which the genetic information encoded in mRNA is used to synthesize proteins. This process occurs on ribosomes and involves the sequential addition of amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain.
