title: 1.1 Introduction to Cells

Cells are the fundamental units of life, and understanding their molecular biology is an active area of research that is fundamental to all biological sciences. The human body is composed of more than 200 different kinds of cells, each specialized for distinctive functions such as memory, sight, movement, and digestion. All present-day cells, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, are descended from a single ancestor.

Cells are composed of water, inorganic ions, and carbon-containing (organic) molecules. Water is the most abundant molecule in cells, accounting for 70% or more of total cell mass. Each cell is enclosed by a delicate plasma membrane that separates its internal contents from the external environment. Within the cell, the protoplasm consists of both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

The fundamental similarities between different types of cells provide a unifying theme to cell biology, allowing the basic principles learned from experiments with one kind of cell to be extrapolated and generalized to other cell types. Although bacteria have been invaluable models for studies of many conserved properties of cells, they obviously cannot be used to study aspects of cell structure and function that are unique to eukaryotes.

Eukaryotic cells, which are larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells, contain a nucleus, cytoplasmic organelles, and a cytoskeleton. They are thought to have evolved from symbiotic associations of prokaryotes. Understanding normal cellular biology provides the essential foundation for comprehending the aberrant changes that occur in cancer.
