title: 1.2 Cellular Organelles and Their Functions
---


Just as the human body relies on specialized organs and tissues to function properly, cells contain distinct components called "organelles," each responsible for a specific function essential to cellular survival. Most cells are between 1 and 100 Î¼m in diameter, and can be observed by light microscopy, as can some of the larger subcellular organelles, such as nuclei, chloroplasts, and mitochondria.

## 1.2.1 Nucleus

The nucleus is the most rigid and largest organelle in the cell, typically occupying its central portion. During cell division, DNA molecules condense into short, rod-like structures called "chromosomes." Human cells typically contain 46 chromosomes, except for mature sex cells, which have a haploid set of 23 chromosomes.

DNA carries the genetic code that directs enzyme production and other cellular proteins, ultimately determining both cell structure and function. Suspended within the nucleus is a nonstaining component called the "nuclear sap," which houses the nucleoli.

## 1.2.2 Ribosomes

Ribosomes measure approximately 15 nm in diameter and exist in both attached and free, unbound forms. Many are tethered to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), while others are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. When found individually, these organelles are referred to as "monosomes," whereas groups of ribosomes are called "polyribosomes." Each ribosome consists of subunits made of RNA, which may be ribosomal (rRNA), messenger (mRNA), or transfer (tRNA) RNA.

## 1.2.3 Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

The rER lumen is continuous with that of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the perinuclear space. This structure primarily modifies synthesized proteins used by the cell. The sER consists of membranes with a smooth outer surface and lacks ribosomes. This organelle is responsible for lipid production and further processing of membrane proteins synthesized by the rER. The sER also aids in drug detoxification.

Only properly folded proteins are delivered to the Golgi apparatus for further processing. If a protein is defective or incompletely folded, it undergoes degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum. An excessive accumulation of misfolded proteins can result in a condition known as endoplasmic reticulum stress, which occurs when protein production surpasses the organelle's capacity to manage and process them effectively.

## 1.2.4 Golgi Apparatus

The Golgi apparatus consists of irregular bodies located near the nucleus. This organelle serves as the cell's processing and distribution center, modifying and sorting proteins and lipids received from the ER and directing them to their appropriate destinations.

## 1.2.5 Mitochondria

Mitochondria are often called the "powerhouses" of the cell, responsible for generating most of the cell's adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria play important roles in cell signaling, both as steroid hormones and as messenger molecules that convey signals from cell surface receptors to targets within the cell.
