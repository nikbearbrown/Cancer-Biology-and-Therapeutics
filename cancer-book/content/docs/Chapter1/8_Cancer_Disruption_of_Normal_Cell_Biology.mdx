title: 1.8 Cancer - Disruption of Normal Cell Biology
---



Cancer is a particularly appropriate topic because it results from a breakdown of the regulatory mechanisms that govern normal cell behavior. The proliferation, differentiation, and survival of individual cells in multicellular organisms are carefully regulated to meet the needs of the organism as a whole. This regulation is lost in cancer cells, which grow and divide in an uncontrolled manner, ultimately spreading throughout the body and interfering with the function of normal tissues and organs.

## 1.8.1 Cancer as a Microevolutionary Process

The body of an animal operates as a society or ecosystem whose individual members are cells, reproducing by cell division and organized into collaborative assemblies or tissues. Unlike free-living cells such as bacteria, which compete to survive, the cells of a multicellular organism are committed to collaboration.

Molecular disturbances that upset this harmony mean trouble for a multicellular society. In a human body with more than 10^14 cells, billions of cells experience mutations every day, potentially disrupting the social controls. Most dangerously, a mutation may give one cell a selective advantage, allowing it to divide more vigorously than its neighbors and to become a founder of a growing mutant clone.

These are the basic ingredients of cancer: it is a disease in which individual mutant clones of cells begin by prospering at the expense of their neighbors, but in the end destroy the whole cellular society.

## 1.8.2 Properties of Cancer Cells

Cancer cells are defined by two heritable properties: they and their progeny (1) reproduce in defiance of the normal restraints on cell division and (2) invade and colonize territories normally reserved for other cells. It is the combination of these actions that makes cancers peculiarly dangerous.

The fundamental abnormality resulting in the development of cancer is the continual unregulated proliferation of cancer cells. Rather than responding appropriately to the signals that control normal cell behavior, cancer cells grow and divide in an uncontrolled manner, invading normal tissues and organs and eventually spreading throughout the body.

## 1.8.3 Cancer Development

In simple terms, cancer is a group of more than 100 diseases that develop across time and involve the uncontrolled division of the body's cells. Although cancer can develop in virtually any of the body's tissues, and each type of cancer has its unique features, the basic processes that produce cancer are quite similar in all forms of the disease.

Cancer begins when a cell breaks free from the normal restraints on cell division and begins to follow its own agenda for proliferation. All of the cells produced by division of this first, ancestral cell and its progeny also display inappropriate proliferation.

An estimated 10^16 cell divisions take place in a normal human body in the course of a lifetime. Clearly, if a single mutation were enough to convert a typical healthy cell into a cancer cell that proliferates without restraint, we would not be viable organisms. Many types of evidence indicate that the genesis of a cancer typically requires that several independent, rare accidents occur in the lineage of one cell.

## 1.8.4 Genetic Instability in Cancer

The great majority of human cancers show signs of a dramatically enhanced mutation rate: the cells are said to be genetically unstable. This instability can take various forms. Some cancer cells are defective in the ability to repair local DNA damage or to correct replication errors that affect individual nucleotides.

Cancer cells can also use specific telomerase to create long repeated sequences of telomeres that prevent the cell from going through apoptosis even after many repeats. The maintenance of all cell functions is important to prevent cancer growth; even small changes in certain genes can cause the over division of cells.
