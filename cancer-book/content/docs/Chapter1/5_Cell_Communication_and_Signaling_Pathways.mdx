title: 1.5 Cell Communication and Signaling Pathways

These observations increase the long list of signal-transduction components that are known to be altered in cancer, such as Ras, Myc, Src, and Erb B. Thus, it is clear that disruption of signal-transduction pathways is a commonly observed event in human cancer and provides a target for therapeutic intervention.

Cell signaling enables cells to respond to their environment, coordinate activities with neighboring cells, and maintain tissue homeostasis. Disruption of signaling pathways is a common feature of cancer, often resulting in uncontrolled proliferation, resistance to cell death, and other hallmark capabilities of malignant cells.
