## 24.10.1 Tumor Heterogeneity

**Intratumor Heterogeneity:** Different regions of the same tumor may have different molecular profiles.

**Intertumor Heterogeneity:** Tumors of the same type may have different molecular characteristics.

**Temporal Heterogeneity:** Tumors evolve over time, changing their molecular profile.

## 24.10.2 Resistance Development

**Inevitable Resistance:** Most patients eventually develop resistance to targeted therapies.

**Rapid Evolution:** Cancer cells can evolve quickly under selective pressure.

**Multiple Mechanisms:** Resistance often involves multiple concurrent mechanisms.

## 24.10.3 Limited Efficacy in Some Cancers

**Lack of Targetable Alterations:** Some cancers lack clear targetable alterations.

**Multiple Driver Mutations:** Cancers with many driver mutations may be difficult to target effectively.

**Tumor Microenvironment:** The microenvironment can protect cancer cells from targeted therapies.

## 24.10.4 Accessibility and Cost

**High Cost:** Targeted therapies are often expensive, limiting access.

**Global Disparities:** Access to targeted therapies varies significantly worldwide.

**Diagnostic Requirements:** The need for molecular testing can create barriers to treatment.
