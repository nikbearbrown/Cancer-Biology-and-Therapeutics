title: 24.2 Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)
---



## 24.2.1 Overview and Classification

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors represent the largest and most successful class of targeted therapies. Protein kinases are ubiquitous intracellular and cell surface proteins that play critical roles in cell signaling pathways involved in metabolism, injury responses, adaptation, growth and differentiation. They act by adding a phosphate group to a protein (phosphorylation), usually on a specific amino acid which often makes the protein or enzyme "active".

The human genome has more than 500 protein kinases and they can be classified as:
1. Tyrosine kinases
2. Serine-threonine kinases
3. Nonspecific kinases (both tyrosine and serine-threonine)

## 24.2.2 Mechanism of Action

TKIs disrupt signal transduction pathways of protein kinases by several modes of inhibition:

**ATP-competitive inhibition:** Most TKIs compete with ATP for binding to the active site of the kinase domain.

**Allosteric inhibition:** Some TKIs bind to sites other than the active site, causing conformational changes that inhibit kinase activity.

**Covalent inhibition:** Certain TKIs form covalent bonds with specific amino acid residues in the kinase domain, leading to irreversible inhibition.

## 24.2.3 Major Classes of TKIs

### Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors

**EGFR Inhibitors:**
- Erlotinib: The most common drugs that cause tyrosine kinase inhibitor keratitis are the medications that inhibit the TKI receptor in the EGFR pathway, such as cetuximab, afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib.
- Gefitinib: A tyrosine kinase inhibitor that actively inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor, approved as first-line treatment for patients diagnosed with NSCLC who had sensitizing EGFR mutations.
- Afatinib: An irreversible EGFR inhibitor that targets multiple ErbB family members.

**HER2 Inhibitors:**
- Lapatinib: A dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor used in HER2-positive breast cancer.

**BCR-ABL Inhibitors:**
- Imatinib: The first successful TKI, targeting the BCR-ABL fusion protein in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Around 1 in every 40 human genes codes for a protein kinase and nearly half of those genes map to either disease loci or cancer amplicons. Interest in protein kinase inhibitors began with the FDA approval of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib in 2001.
- Dasatinib: A second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor effective against many imatinib-resistant mutants.
- Nilotinib: Another second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor with improved potency.

**Multi-targeted Kinase Inhibitors:**
- Sunitinib: Targets multiple kinases including VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-KIT.
- Sorafenib: Targets RAF, VEGFR, and PDGFR, among others.

## 24.2.4 Clinical Applications

TKIs have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in various cancer types:

**Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML):** Imatinib was the first TKI approved for CML patients with the Philadelphia chromosome. It seems increasingly likely that CML, whose diagnosis was once a death sentence, will soon be a disease that is controlled, if not cured, by available targeted therapies.

**Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):** EGFR inhibitors have shown significant efficacy in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. About 10 percent of patients with advanced lung cancer showed good initial responses to EGFR inhibitors like gefitinib.

**Hepatocellular Carcinoma:** Sorafenib was the first drug approved for advanced HCC based on improved overall survival. More recently, lenvatinib has been approved as an alternative first-line agent.

## 24.2.5 Resistance Mechanisms

Despite initial efficacy, resistance to TKIs is common:

**Primary resistance:** Some patients do not respond to TKIs from the start, often due to:
- Lack of target dependence
- Presence of resistance mutations
- Activation of alternative pathways

**Acquired resistance:** Patients who initially respond may develop resistance through:
- Secondary mutations in the target kinase
- Bypass signaling pathways
- Phenotypic changes in cancer cells
