title: 24.6 Angiogenesis Inhibitors
---



## 24.6.1 Overview and Rationale

Angiogenesis—the formation of new blood vessels—is central to the growth of cancer. Tumor angiogenesis is required for tumors to grow beyond a few millimeters in size and for metastatic spread. An understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of tumor angiogenesis is therefore important for clinicians who diagnose and treat cancer.

During the prevascular phase, when angiogenic activity is absent or insufficient, tumors remain small, with volumes measured in a few cubic millimeters. When the prevascular phase of bladder cancer, cervical cancer, or cutaneous melanoma is first detected, these lesions may remain dormant for years before becoming vascularized.

## 24.6.2 VEGF Pathway Inhibitors

**Bevacizumab:** The prototype anti-angiogenic therapy. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). It blocks the interaction between VEGF-A and the VEGF receptors (VEGFR), primarily VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, on the surface of endothelial cells.

**Mechanism of Action:**
- Binding of VEGF-A to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 leads to endothelial cell proliferation
- Activation of survival pathways
- Formation of new blood vessels and angiogenesis
- Bevacizumab inhibits these processes

**Clinical Applications:**
- Colorectal cancer (first approval)
- Non-small cell lung cancer
- Glioblastoma
- Ovarian cancer
- Renal cell carcinoma

## 24.6.3 Small Molecule VEGFR Inhibitors

**Sunitinib:** A multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-KIT.

**Sorafenib:** Targets multiple kinases including VEGFR, PDGFR, and RAF kinases.

**Pazopanib:** A selective multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

## 24.6.4 Clinical Efficacy and Limitations

**Efficacy:** Angiogenesis inhibitors have shown significant clinical benefit:
- Improved progression-free survival in multiple cancer types
- Improved overall survival in some settings
- Combination with chemotherapy often superior to monotherapy

**Limitations:**
- Transient benefit in most patients
- Development of resistance
- Limited impact on overall survival in many cancers

## 24.6.5 Toxicity Profile

**Hypertension:** The overall incidence of significantly raised blood pressure was 8% among patients receiving bevacizumab, with a significantly increased risk compared to controls.

**Proteinuria:** Addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapeutic regimens significantly increased the risk of high-grade proteinuria in patients with cancer.

**Bleeding:** Increased risk of serious hemorrhage, particularly in squamous cell lung cancer.

**Thromboembolism:** The use of bevacizumab was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism in cancer patients.

**Other toxicities:**
- Wound healing complications
- Gastrointestinal perforation
- Congestive heart failure
- Ovarian failure in premenopausal women
