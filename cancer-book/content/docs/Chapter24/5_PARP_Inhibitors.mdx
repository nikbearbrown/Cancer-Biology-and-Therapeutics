title: 24.4 PARP Inhibitors
---



## 24.4.1 Overview and Mechanism

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors represent a successful example of synthetic lethality in cancer therapy. PARP-1 is one of the earliest nuclear enzymes to be targeted for degradation by caspases during apoptosis. The subcellular localization of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (now called PARP-1) in the nucleus and its enzymatic activation by DNA strand breaks immediately suggested that this modification should represent an important mechanism of DNA repair.

PARP inhibitors work by:
**DNA repair interference:** PARP-1 is essential for single-strand DNA break repair. When PARP is inhibited, single-strand breaks persist and can be converted to double-strand breaks during DNA replication.

**Synthetic lethality:** In cells with defective homologous recombination (such as BRCA-mutated cells), PARP inhibition leads to synthetic lethality because the cells cannot repair DNA double-strand breaks effectively.

## 24.4.2 Clinical Applications

**Ovarian Cancer:** PARP inhibitors have shown significant efficacy in BRCA-mutated ovarian cancers:
- Olaparib: The first PARP inhibitor approved for clinical use
- Rucaparib: Another PARP inhibitor with similar efficacy
- Niraparib: Approved for maintenance therapy

**Breast Cancer:** PARP inhibitors are effective in BRCA-mutated breast cancers:
- Olaparib for BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer
- Talazoparib for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer

**Prostate Cancer:** Recent approvals include:
- Olaparib for BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer

## 24.4.3 Resistance Mechanisms

**Restoration of homologous recombination:** Cancer cells may restore DNA repair capability through:
- Reversion mutations in BRCA genes
- Upregulation of DNA repair genes

**PARP expression changes:** Tumors may alter PARP expression levels.

**Drug efflux:** Increased drug efflux can reduce intracellular drug concentrations.
