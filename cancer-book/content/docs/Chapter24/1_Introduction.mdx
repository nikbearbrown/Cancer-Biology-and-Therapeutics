Targeted therapies represent a revolutionary approach in cancer treatment, moving away from broadly cytotoxic agents toward drugs that specifically target the molecular abnormalities of cancer cells. They are unique and represent a major advance in cancer chemotherapy, away from broadly cytotoxic agents and towards drugs that specifically target the molecular abnormalities of cancer cells. The development of targeted therapies has been one of the most significant medical breakthroughs of the 21st century, offering improved therapeutic efficacy with reduced systemic toxicity compared to traditional chemotherapy.

The concept of targeted therapy is based on the understanding that cancer cells harbor specific genetic alterations, protein overexpression, or pathway dysregulation that distinguish them from normal cells. These molecular abnormalities create dependencies that can be exploited therapeutically. The potent activity and lack of generalized toxicity of targeted therapies relate to the specificity of the antagonist for the mutated protein. In like manner, their toxicity often relates to off-target activity, either to the unmutated kinase or to closely related, normal kinases.
