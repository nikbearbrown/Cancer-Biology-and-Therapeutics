title: 24.3 Monoclonal Antibodies

## 24.3.1 Overview and Development

Monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized cancer therapy by providing highly specific targeting of cancer-associated antigens. Following the initial report of Kohler and Milstein, monoclonal antibody technology has exerted a prompt and substantial impact on laboratory investigation. Over the last 25 years, the availability of monoclonal reagents has permitted the development of novel markers for in vitro applications and application for the in vivo treatment of human cancer.

As of 2022, more than 80 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have been approved for use in the United States. Modern-day medicine has been revolutionized to be personalized and specific based on individualized specific disease characteristics. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a prime example of personalized therapeutics enabled by advances in our knowledge of immunology, molecular biology, and biochemistry.

## 24.3.2 Mechanisms of Action

Monoclonal antibodies exert their therapeutic effects through several mechanisms:

**Direct cytotoxicity:** Antibodies can directly induce cell death through:
- Apoptosis induction
- Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)
- Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)

**Receptor blocking:** Antibodies can block:
- Growth factor receptors
- Immune checkpoint receptors
- Adhesion molecules

**Immune system activation:** Antibodies can:
- Recruit immune effector cells
- Activate complement cascade
- Present tumor antigens to immune cells

## 24.3.3 Major Classes of Therapeutic Antibodies

### Naked Antibodies

**Anti-HER2 Antibodies:**
- Trastuzumab (Herceptin): Targets HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. The humanized murine anti-HER-2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab produced objective regression of recurrent breast carcinoma in 12 to 15% of 269 heavily pretreated women.
- Pertuzumab: Another anti-HER2 antibody with a different binding site.

**Anti-CD20 Antibodies:**
- Rituximab: Revolutionized treatment of B-cell lymphomas. In cancer cells, cross-linking CD20 can induce cell cycle arrest, inhibit DNA synthesis, activate caspases, and induce apoptosis.
- Ofatumumab: A fully human anti-CD20 antibody.

**Anti-VEGF Antibodies:**
- Bevacizumab: The prototype anti-angiogenic antibody targeting VEGF-A.

### Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs)

ADCs combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic drugs:

**Components of ADCs:**
- Antibody: Provides tumor targeting
- Linker: Connects antibody to payload
- Payload: Cytotoxic agent (often microtubule inhibitors)

**Approved ADCs:**
- Gemtuzumab ozogamicin: Anti-CD33 antibody conjugated to calicheamicin for AML
- Brentuximab vedotin: Anti-CD30 antibody for lymphomas
- Trastuzumab emtansine: Anti-HER2 antibody for breast cancer

## 24.3.4 Clinical Applications

**Hematologic Malignancies:** Monoclonal antibodies have been particularly successful in blood cancers:
- Rituximab for non-Hodgkin lymphoma
- Alemtuzumab for chronic lymphocytic leukemia
- Daratumumab for multiple myeloma

**Solid Tumors:** Applications include:
- Trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer
- Bevacizumab for colorectal, lung, and other cancers
- Cetuximab for colorectal and head/neck cancers

## 24.3.5 Resistance Mechanisms

**Antigen loss or alteration:** Cancer cells may lose expression of the target antigen or alter its structure.

**Immune system evasion:** Tumors may develop mechanisms to avoid immune recognition.

**Complement resistance:** Some cancers upregulate complement resistance proteins.
