title: 24.8 Clinical Considerations and Patient Selection
---



## 24.8.1 Biomarker-Driven Therapy

**Companion Diagnostics:** Many targeted therapies require specific biomarkers for patient selection:
- HER2 amplification for trastuzumab
- EGFR mutations for EGFR inhibitors
- BRCA mutations for PARP inhibitors
- Hormone receptor status for CDK4/6 inhibitors

**Tumor Profiling:** Comprehensive genomic profiling is increasingly used to identify targetable alterations.

**Liquid Biopsies:** Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis allows for non-invasive monitoring of resistance mutations.

## 24.8.2 Toxicity Management

**Mechanism-Based Toxicities:** Understanding the mechanism of action helps predict and manage toxicities:
- EGFR inhibitors: Skin toxicity, diarrhea
- VEGF inhibitors: Hypertension, proteinuria
- CDK4/6 inhibitors: Neutropenia, fatigue

**Dose Modifications:** Structured dose reduction algorithms help maintain treatment while managing toxicity.

**Supportive Care:** Appropriate supportive care measures are essential for maintaining quality of life.

## 24.8.3 Resistance Monitoring

**Serial Biopsies:** Tissue biopsies can identify resistance mechanisms, though they are invasive.

**Liquid Biopsies:** ctDNA analysis provides a non-invasive method for monitoring resistance.

**Imaging Biomarkers:** Functional imaging can provide early indicators of treatment failure.

## 24.8.4 Economic Considerations

**Cost-Effectiveness:** Targeted therapies are often expensive, requiring careful cost-effectiveness analysis.

The development of TKI represents one of the most significant medical breakthroughs of the 21st century; however, one of the drawbacks of this drug class is the financial burden to the patient. Kinase inhibitor therapy ranges from $5000 to $10,000 per month or more in the United States.

**Access to Treatment:** Ensuring equitable access to targeted therapies is a significant challenge.

**Value-Based Care:** Incorporating outcomes data into treatment decisions and reimbursement.
