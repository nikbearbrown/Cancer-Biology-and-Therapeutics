## 24.5.1 Overview and Cell Cycle Regulation

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are essential regulators of the cell cycle and transcription. CDK activity is highly regulated in cells through multiple mechanisms:
1. Binding to cyclin proteins for activation
2. Inhibition by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs)
3. Inhibitory phosphorylation in the ATP-binding pocket
4. Activating phosphorylation in the T-loop

The cyclin kinases 4 and 6 regulate the cellular transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle acting through the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) pathway.

## 24.5.2 CDK4/6 Inhibitors

**Palbociclib:** The first CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for clinical use. Palbociclib is an orally available, specific inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases that is used in combination with aromatase inhibitors in the therapy of postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer that is positive for the estrogen receptor (ER+), but negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-).

**Ribociclib:** A unique cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that is used in combination with aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer.

**Abemaciclib:** A selective CDK4/6 inhibitor with activity as monotherapy and in combination with endocrine therapy.

## 24.5.3 Mechanism of Action

CDK4/6 inhibitors work by:
**Cell cycle arrest:** Inhibition of CDK4/6 prevents phosphorylation of Rb protein, leading to G1/S cell cycle arrest.

**Senescence induction:** Prolonged CDK4/6 inhibition can lead to cellular senescence.

**Immune system activation:** CDK4/6 inhibition may enhance immune recognition of cancer cells.

## 24.5.4 Clinical Applications

**Breast Cancer:** CDK4/6 inhibitors have transformed treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer:
- First-line therapy in combination with aromatase inhibitors
- Second-line therapy with fulvestrant
- Significant improvement in progression-free survival

**Other Cancers:** CDK4/6 inhibitors are being investigated in:
- Lung cancer
- Melanoma
- Sarcoma
- Glioblastoma

## 24.5.5 Resistance Mechanisms

**Rb pathway alterations:** Loss of Rb function or alterations in upstream regulators can confer resistance.

**Cyclin E amplification:** Overexpression of cyclin E can drive CDK2 activation independent of CDK4/6.

**Cell cycle checkpoint defects:** Alterations in cell cycle checkpoints may allow cells to bypass CDK4/6 inhibition.
