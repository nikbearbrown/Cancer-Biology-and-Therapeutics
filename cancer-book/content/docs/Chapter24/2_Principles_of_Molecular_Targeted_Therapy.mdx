title: 24.1 Principles of Molecular Targeted Therapy

## 24.1.1 Fundamental Concepts

Targeted therapies work through several fundamental mechanisms:

**Oncogene addiction:** Cancer cells often become dependent on specific oncogenes for their survival and proliferation. This dependency, termed "oncogene addiction," creates a therapeutic vulnerability that can be exploited with targeted agents.

**Synthetic lethality:** Some targeted therapies exploit the concept of synthetic lethality, where the combination of defects in two genes results in cell death, while a defect in only one gene is compatible with cell survival.

**Pathway dependence:** Whether a cancer can be treated effectively with a targeted therapy may depend largely on the extent to which the growth of the tumor cells is dependent on the targeted pathway(s).

## 24.1.2 Target Validation and Selection

The selection of appropriate targets is crucial for the success of targeted therapy:

**Genetic mechanisms of activation:** The most attractive cancers for targeted therapy are those diseases in which there is a genomic mechanism of target activation. These include:
- Gene amplification
- Chromosomal translocations
- Activating mutations
- Tumor suppressor gene inactivation

**Pathway dependency:** The clinical effect of targeted therapy depends on the extent to which tumor cells depend on the targeted pathway. Monotherapy with a targeted agent may be most useful in the earlier stages of disease, if activation of a specific pathway is critical to the development of the tumor.

**Biomarker identification:** Accurate identification of patients who will benefit from targeted therapy requires reliable biomarkers. These may include:
- Protein expression levels
- Gene amplification status
- Mutation analysis
- Pathway activation signatures

## 24.1.3 Therapeutic Window and Selectivity

The therapeutic success of targeted agents depends on achieving selectivity between cancer cells and normal cells. This selectivity can be achieved through:

**Differential target expression:** Cancer cells may express higher levels of the target protein than normal cells.

**Mutational selectivity:** Some targeted agents preferentially inhibit mutated forms of proteins over wild-type versions.

**Tissue-specific expression:** Some targets are primarily expressed in specific tissue types, allowing for more selective targeting.
