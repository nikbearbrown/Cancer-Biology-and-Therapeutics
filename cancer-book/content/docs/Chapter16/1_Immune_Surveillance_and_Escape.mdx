title: 16.1 Immune Surveillance and Escape
---




The relationship between the immune system and cancer represents one of the most complex and dynamic interactions in human biology. The concept of immune surveillance of tumors implies that a component of the immune system has evolved for the elimination of neoplastic cells, and this system provides protection of an organism from abnormal growth of cells and subsequent tumor development.

## 16.1.1 The Concept of Immune Surveillance

**Historical Perspective and Theoretical Foundation**

The concept of immune surveillance was first articulated by Burnet, who called the ability of the immune system to detect tumor cells and destroy them 'immune surveillance.' This concept implies that development and progression of tumor cells result from a failure of the surveillance system either to recognize tumor cells or to successfully express the relevant effector mechanisms.

In contrast to responses to invading infectious agents, tumor surveillance must include mechanisms that recognize "self" tumor cells as different from normal cells for targeting of their destruction. This concept also implies that development and progression of tumor cells result from a failure of the surveillance system either to recognize tumor cells or to successfully express the relevant effector mechanisms.

**Evidence for Immune Surveillance**

While the study of tumor immunity has developed in fits and starts during the course of the past century, it is now well established that there are both nonadaptive and adaptive elements of the immune system that are responsible for the surveillance and elimination of tumor cells.

Experiments in animals have, however, provided evidence for immune responses to tumors and have shown that T cells are a critical mediator of tumor immunity. Transplantable tumors in mice exhibit a variable pattern of growth when injected into syngeneic recipients. Most tumors grow progressively and eventually kill the host. However, if mice are injected with irradiated tumor cells that cannot grow, they are frequently protected against subsequent injection with a normally lethal dose of viable cells of the same tumor.

**Limitations of Immune Surveillance**

However, it is difficult to show that tumors are subject to surveillance by the immune system; after all, cancer is a common disease, and most tumors show little evidence of immunological control. The incidence of the common tumors in mice that lack lymphocytes is little different from their incidence in mice with normal immune systems; the same is true for humans deficient in T cells.

The major tumor types that occur with increased frequency in immunodeficient mice or humans are virus-associated tumors; immune surveillance thus seems to be critical for control of virus-associated tumors, but the immune system does not normally respond to the novel antigens deriving from the multiple genetic alterations in spontaneous tumors.

## 16.1.2 Mechanisms of Tumor Immune Evasion

**The Three Es: Elimination, Equilibrium, and Escape**

In the Darwinian TME, tumour cell-centred and host cell-centred mechanisms of immune evasion drive progression, invasion, and metastasis. Failure of effective immunity is associated with progression and the appearance of clinical cancer.

Appropriately activated T cells and innate immune effectors (natural killer [NK] cells) mediate early elimination of transformed cells and limit progression. T-cell-orchestrated type 1 immune responses mediate host resistance during the early phases of carcinogenesis. Moreover, in human tumours, the presence of T cells and type 1 immunity or interferon signatures is associated with better prognosis.

**Tumor Cell-Intrinsic Escape Mechanisms**

**Loss of MHC Class I Expression:**
Some tumors, such as colon and cervical cancers, lose the expression of a particular MHC class I molecule, perhaps through immunoselection by T cells specific for a peptide presented by that MHC class I molecule. In experimental studies, when a tumor loses expression of all MHC class I molecules, it can no longer be recognized by cytotoxic T cells, although it might become susceptible to NK cells.

However, tumors that lose only one MHC class I molecule might be able to avoid recognition by specific CD8 cytotoxic T cells while remaining resistant to NK cells, conferring a selective advantage in vivo.

**Antigen Loss and Immunoediting:**
Tumors tend to be genetically unstable and can lose their antigens by mutation; in the event of an immune response, this instability might generate mutants that can escape the immune response. Cancer cells can escape immune recognition via "immunoediting," allowing cancer cell clones without detectable cancer antigens to dominate and escape from the pressure of immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Mechanisms of physical exclusion (e.g. extracellular matrix deposition), and selection of less immunogenic variants, can hamper effective recognition.

## 16.1.3 Host-Mediated Immune Dysfunction

**T-Cell Exhaustion**

T-cell exhaustion is an effector T-cell-intrinsic mechanism for failure to mount an effective immune response. Single-cell genomic analysis has provided new vistas on the T-cell receptor repertoire and functional properties of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes.

**Regulatory T Cell Activity**

Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) have long been associated with immunosuppression in cancer. Single-cell analysis has led to the identification of molecules expressed by infiltrating Treg cells. For instance, the IL-1 decoy receptor IL-1R2 was found to be expressed at very high levels in infiltrating Treg cells.

**Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells**

Even though this defense system is well developed, the tumor often has the ability to develop an immunosuppressive microenvironment favorable to its progression. Specifically, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), regulatory T (Treg) cells, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are well-known players.
