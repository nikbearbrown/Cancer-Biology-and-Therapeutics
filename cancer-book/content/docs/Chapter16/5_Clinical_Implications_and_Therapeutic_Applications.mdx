Understanding tumor immunology has led to revolutionary advances in cancer treatment, with immunotherapy emerging as a major pillar of cancer care alongside surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

## Immunotherapeutic Approaches

**Checkpoint Inhibitors**

The use of monoclonal antibodies can be used in cancer immunotherapy (eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). These drugs include pembrolizumab and atezolizumab. These ICIs unlock the immune system, which is then able to recognize tumors and kill them.

Anti-PD-1 drugs have been successful in treating advanced cancers that resist standard treatments. Once researchers gained an understanding of how the PD-1 pathway works, they were able to leverage that knowledge to develop mechanistic biomarkers and FDA-approved anti-PD-1 therapies.

**CAR T-Cell Therapy**

CAR T-cell therapy, or Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy, is a groundbreaking immunotherapy approach used to treat certain types of cancer. CAR T-cell therapy involves engineering a patient's T cells in the laboratory to specifically target and kill their tumors.

This approach has been challenging in solid tumors but much more successful in blood cancers, especially when applied to naive and early memory T cells, which have enormous proliferation capacity and long-term persistence potential.

**Adoptive Cell Transfer**

Growing evidence has suggested that lack of eradication of the malignant stem cell forms the basis for cancer relapse and progression. These data set the stage for newer approaches that focus on immune targeting of antigens that are present on the cancer stem cell.

## Future Directions

As we better understand fundamental mechanisms, including novel checkpoints, targeting of tumour-promoting myeloid cells, and harnessing NK cell potential, these advances hold promise to help predict which patients will be responsive, thus sparing toxicity and contributing to the financial sustainability and to the improvement of therapeutic results.

The goal in the development of anti-cancer vaccines is to break the tolerance of the immune system for antigens expressed mainly or exclusively by the tumor. It is not surprising that spontaneously arising tumors are rarely rejected by T cells, as in general they probably lack either distinctive antigenic peptides or the adhesion or co-stimulatory molecules needed to elicit a primary T-cell response.
