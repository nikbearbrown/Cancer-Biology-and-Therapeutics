title: 16.3 Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses
---




The immune system's response to cancer involves a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immunity, with each arm contributing distinct but complementary functions in tumor recognition and elimination.

## 16.3.1 Innate Immune Responses to Cancer

**Natural Killer (NK) Cells**

Natural killer cells are innate lymphoid cells that have long been considered to play a role in resistance against haematogenous dissemination of cancer cells, in particular to the lungs. The natural killer cells are the third major part of the innate immune system. Their main job is to identify cells that have been infected by a virus, as well as abnormal cells that may turn into (or have turned into) tumor cells.

**NK Cell Recognition Mechanisms**

NK cells monitor the level of class I MHC proteins, which are expressed on the surface of most vertebrate cells. The presence of high levels of these proteins inhibits the killing activity of NK cells, so that the NK cells selectively kill cells expressing low levels of class I MHC proteins.

These cells detect infected cells (mainly infected by viruses) or malignant cells in which expression of MHC molecules has decreased, is altered or abolished. NK cells have the ability to distinguish the normal host cells through the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and CD94-NKG2A inhibitory receptors which recognize the MHC class I expressed on the surface of these normal cells.

**NK Cell Effector Functions**

NK cells have granules with perforins and granzymes that act on target cells inducing lysis or apoptosis and also express PRRs including TLR-2, -3, -4, -5, -7, and -8. Once activated, NK cells secrete IFN-γ, TNF-α growth factors, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and chemokines.

The differentiation and activity of NK cells are also controlled by negative regulators. Recently, novel NK cell checkpoints (e.g. IL-1R8) were identified, and unleashed NK cells were found to mediate resistance to carcinogenesis and metastasis at NK-cell-rich anatomical sites, such as the liver and the lung.

**Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs)**

Inflammatory cells, in particular TAMs, pave the way to tissue invasion and intravasation and provide a nurturing microenvironment for metastasis, serving as a component of the cancer cell niche at distant sites.

As expected given the complexity and diversity of the roles of innate and adaptive immunity, infiltration of different components of the immune system has different, at times divergent, prognostic significance. Infiltration of TAMs is generally associated with worse prognosis, which is a reflection of their pro-tumour function. However, infiltration of TAMs is associated with better prognosis in colorectal cancer.

## 16.3.2 Adaptive Immune Responses to Cancer

**T-Cell Mediated Immunity**

The immune system's antitumor activity is mainly carried out by tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), T effector (Teff) cells, antibody-producing B cells, as well as antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DC), which lead to adaptive immunity by directly recognizing and eliminating cancer cells.

**Helper T Cell Subsets**

Helper T cells are arguably the most important cells in adaptive immunity, as they are required for almost all adaptive immune responses. They not only help activate B cells to secrete antibodies and macrophages to destroy ingested microbes, but they also help activate cytotoxic T cells to kill infected target cells.

The specific cytokines present during the process of helper T cell activation influence the type of effector cell produced. Thus, the decision of naïve helper T cells to differentiate into TH1 or TH2 effector cells influences the type of adaptive immune response that will be mounted against the pathogen—whether it will be dominated by macrophage activation or by antibody production.

**T-Cell Activation Requirements**

To activate a cytotoxic or helper T cell to proliferate and differentiate into an effector cell, an antigen-presenting cell provides two kinds of signals. Signal 1 is provided by a foreign peptide bound to an MHC protein on the surface of the presenting cell. This peptide-MHC complex signals through the T cell receptor and its associated proteins. Signal 2 is provided by costimulatory proteins, especially the B7 proteins (CD80 and CD86), which are recognized by the co-receptor protein CD28 on the surface of the T cell.

## 16.3.3 The Role of Dendritic Cells

**Antigen Presentation Function**

Dendritic cells (DC) are a widely distributed group of cells specialized in antigen sampling. In fact, they also constitute the most efficient antigen presenting cells for T cell activation, hence being the linking bridge between innate and adaptive immune responses.

The function of dendritic cells, however, is not primarily to destroy pathogens but to carry pathogen antigens to peripheral lymphoid organs and there present them to T lymphocytes. When a dendritic cell takes up a pathogen in infected tissue, it becomes activated, and travels to a nearby lymph node.

**Maturation and Migration**

On activation, the dendritic cell matures into a highly effective antigen-presenting cell (APC) and undergoes changes that enable it to activate pathogen-specific lymphocytes that it encounters in the lymph node. Activated dendritic cells secrete cytokines that influence both innate and adaptive immune responses, making these cells essential gatekeepers that determine whether and how the immune system responds to the presence of infectious agents.

## 16.3.4 B-Cell Responses in Cancer

**Humoral Immunity**

In antibody responses, B cells are activated to secrete antibodies, which are proteins called immunoglobulins. The antibodies circulate in the bloodstream and permeate the other body fluids, where they bind specifically to the foreign antigen that stimulated their production.

**Tumor-Promoting B-Cell Functions**

However, evidence suggests that B cells can contribute to tumour progression in certain epithelial tumours, such as prostate cancer. B-cell-mediated tumour promotion has been shown to involve different mechanisms, such as production of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10) and/or production of antibodies and formation of immune complexes that skew TAMs in an M2-like direction.
