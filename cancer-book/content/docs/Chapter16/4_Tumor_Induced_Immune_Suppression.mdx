title: 16.4 Tumor-Induced Immune Suppression
---




Cancer cells have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to suppress and evade immune responses, creating an environment that favors tumor growth and progression while undermining effective anti-tumor immunity.

## 16.4.1 Immunosuppressive Factors Produced by Tumors

**Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β)**

There is ample evidence that tumor cells produce immunosuppressive factors, and this has been verified to have local as well as systemic effects on immune function. Recent reports using a variety of tumor models have indicated that either the elimination of TGF-β or the inhibition of its function is of significance for tumorigenicity and/or immunogenicity of gliomas.

For instance, Jachimczak and colleagues treated human gliomas with TGF-β2-specific phosphorothioate-antisense (AS) oligodeoxynucleotides and determined that this resulted in a marked reduction in tumor-mediated suppression of lymphocyte proliferative responses to IL-2.

**Prostaglandins (PGs)**

PGs can also induce the production of IL-10, which has immunosuppressive effects. Over the past decade, a number of reports have provided data indicating that tumor cells can either directly produce PGs or induce macrophages in the tumor microenvironment to secrete PGs.

For instance, several reports indicate that tumors, including colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) and head and neck cancers, produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and this is responsible for some of the immunosuppressive effects associated with these tumors.

The pathway responsible for these effects has recently been elucidated as being a consequence of cyclooxygenase (COX) overexpression in cancer cells, particularly COX-2. Overexpression of COX-2 results in increased production of PGs by tumor cells and, in the case of PGE2, results in an upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, in tumor cells.

## 16.4.2 Activation-Induced Cell Death (AICD)

**Fas-FasL Pathway**

Dysfunctional immune responses can result as some tumor cells express Fas ligand (FasL) and bind Fas expressed on some infiltrating lymphocytes resulting in AICD seems to be differentially regulated in T-helper subsets. Upon stimulation with phorbol ester and ionomycin or anti-TCR:CD3 Ab, Th1 clones express significantly higher levels of surface FasL than do Th2 clones.

**Clinical Significance**

AICD is considered to be one of the mechanisms responsible for the increased apoptotic rate among TILs. Thus, antigenic stimulation within the tumor microenvironment might be involved in the enhanced expression and function of FasL on T cells, resulting in activation-induced cell death of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

## 16.4.3 Metabolic Immunosuppression

**Competition for Nutrients**

Rapidly growing tumor cells require nutrients, oxygen, and essential metabolites to proliferate and, at the same time, create an immunosuppressive microenvironment. How immune cells and cancer cells share or compete in these harsh environmental conditions and how the TME alters immunometabolism are important questions to address.

**Hypoxia and Acidification**

As the tumor grows larger, (1) oxygen supply becomes limited, thus creating a hypoxic condition; (2) nutrients become deficient; and (3) the microenvironment becomes acidic. Recent findings suggest that these harsh metabolic states significantly disrupt T-cell function.

Therefore, the influence of cancer cell metabolism on the TME may directly control the metabolic pathways in surrounding T cells. The tumor microenvironment physically constitutes a barrier against T-cell infiltration, as it is a compact structure with tight interactions among cancer cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, and ECM.

## 16.4.4 Checkpoint Inhibition and Immune Suppression

**PD-1/PD-L1 Pathway**

The PD-1 pathway is active in many tumor types, and unlike ligands for CTLA-4, which are expressed everywhere in the body on antigen-presenting cells, PD-L1 (the major ligand for PD-1) is selectively expressed in cancers and at sites of inflammation.

**CTLA-4 Pathway**

Tumour progression and escape are associated with immunosuppressive pathways in innate and adaptive anti-tumour responses, which include, among others, suppressive myeloid cells, activation of checkpoint blockade, and induction and recruitment of Treg cells.

**Clinical Applications**

Immunotherapy in the form of PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cells is now part of the anticancer armamentarium. In spite of the unprecedented broad impact of checkpoint blockade inhibitors, only approximately 20% of treated patients benefit from current checkpoint blockade.
