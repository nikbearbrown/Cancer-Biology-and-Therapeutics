title: 16.2 Tumor Antigens and Neoantigens
---




The identification and characterization of tumor antigens has been a central focus in cancer immunology, as these molecules represent the targets that enable the immune system to distinguish malignant cells from their normal counterparts.

## 16.2.1 Definition and Classification of Tumor Antigens

**Fundamental Concepts**

The term "tumor antigen" has been given a new and much more precise definition as a result of important developments in immunology over the last decade, particularly in the area of antigen presentation and antigen recognition. For something to be a tumor antigen, it must be recognized by specific immune effector cells and/or antibodies and be produced by tumor cells.

Among the tumor antigens, some may be tumor specific while others may also be expressed by normal tissues. The molecular characterization of T cell-defined antigens has allowed the definition of tumor epitopes recognized by T cells.

**Antigen Presentation Pathways**

CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL) recognize small peptides (8–10 amino acids long) that have been processed from a larger protein from tumor cells and presented in the peptide-binding cleft of MHC class I molecules on the surface of the tumor cells.

While still located within intracellular compartments, these tumor peptides associate with nascent MHC class I or class II molecules and are subsequently transported to the cell surface, where they become accessible to T-cell scrutiny.

**Proteasomal Processing**

The ability of a given peptide to bind to, and be presented by, a given MHC allele is determined by structural motifs within the peptide sequence that allow for sufficient compatibility between peptide amino side-chains and micropockets formed within the peptide-binding groove of the MHC molecule.

In the presence of IFN-γ, the catalytic subunits of standard proteasomes are replaced by alternate subunits to form the immunoproteasome. This novel proteolytic complex exhibits enzymatic specificities that differ from the standard proteasome, resulting in a modified repertoire of processed peptides.

## 16.2.2 Categories of Tumor Antigens

**Tumor-Associated Antigens (TAAs)**

The molecular characterization of tumor antigens has allowed a better understanding of the genetic events that may give rise to tumor-specific antigens. Tumor antigens can be loosely categorized as oncofetal (typically only expressed in fetal tissues and in cancerous somatic cells), oncoviral (encoded by tumorigenic transforming viruses), overexpressed/accumulated (expressed by both normal and neoplastic tissue, with the level of expression highly elevated in neoplasia), cancer-testis (expressed only by cancer cells and adult reproductive tissues such as testis and placenta), lineage-restricted (expressed largely by a single cancer histotype), mutated (only expressed by cancer as a result of genetic mutation or alteration in transcription), posttranslationally altered (tumor-associated alterations in glycosylation, etc.), or idiotypic (highly polymorphic genes where a tumor cell expresses a specific "clonotype").

**Oncofetal Antigens**

These antigens are typically only expressed in fetal tissues and in cancerous somatic cells. Examples include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which are re-expressed during carcinogenesis despite being normally absent in adult tissues.

**Cancer-Testis Antigens**

This category includes antigens expressed only by cancer cells and adult reproductive tissues such as testis and placenta. These antigens are particularly attractive targets for immunotherapy because their expression is restricted to tumors and immune-privileged sites.

**Overexpressed/Accumulated Antigens**

These are expressed by both normal and neoplastic tissue, with the level of expression highly elevated in neoplasia. For example, the p53 tumor-suppressor gene product is frequently mutated in cancer cells, resulting in the accumulation of p53 protein in these cells in concert with reduced cell-cycle regulatory control by the tumor cells.

## 16.2.3 Neoantigens: The New Frontier

**Definition and Origin of Neoantigens**

TSAs are highly specific and typically result from genetic mutations within malignant cells that give rise to neoantigens not present in untransformed (nonmalignant) cells. By definition, there is a low likelihood of 'on-target off-tumour' toxicity because the tumour antigen is not expressed on normal cells.

Evidence in mouse and human tumours has indicated that mutations and genetic instability represent the fundamental molecular basis for T-cell-dependent anti-tumour immunity. The intersection of genomics and the dissection of immunity is paving the way to personalized immunotherapy approaches.

**Advantages of Neoantigens**

Neoantigens offer several advantages as immunotherapeutic targets:

1. **True tumor specificity**: Should not be expressed on normal tissue cells, at least not in nonessential normal tissues (i.e., tumour specific)
2. **No central tolerance**: Because these antigens are not present during T-cell development, there is no deletion of reactive T cells in the thymus
3. **High immunogenicity**: Novel sequences can be readily recognized as foreign by the immune system

**Clinical Implications**

Unfortunately, no nonpolymorphic tumour-specific extracellular target antigens are known. However, the identification of patient-specific neoantigens through genomic analysis opens possibilities for personalized cancer vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies.

## 16.2.4 Melanoma Antigens: A Model System

**Discovery and Characterization**

In melanoma, tumor-specific antigens were discovered by culturing irradiated tumor cells with autologous lymphocytes, a reaction known as the mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell culture. From such cultures, cytotoxic T lymphocytes could be identified that would kill, in an MHC-restricted fashion, tumor cells bearing the relevant tumor-specific antigen.

These studies have yielded three important findings. The first is that melanomas carry at least five different antigens that can be recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The second is that cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive against melanoma antigens are not expanded in vivo, suggesting that these antigens are not immunogenic in vivo.

The third is that the expression of these antigens can be selected against in vitro and possibly also in vivo by the presence of specific cytotoxic T cells.

**Clinical Relevance**

Functional melanoma-specific T cells can be propagated from peripheral blood lymphocytes, from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or by draining the lymph nodes of patients in whom the melanoma is growing. Interestingly, none of the peptides recognized by these T cells derives from the mutant proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that are likely to be responsible for the initial transformation of the cell into a cancer cell, although a few are the products of mutant genes.
