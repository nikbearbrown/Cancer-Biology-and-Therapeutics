Programmed cell death plays critical roles in a wide variety of physiologic processes during fetal development and in adult tissues. In most cases, physiologic cell death occurs by a process known as "apoptosis." Defects in apoptotic cell death contribute to neoplastic diseases, by preventing or delaying normal cell turnover, thus promoting cell accumulation. Defects in apoptosis also facilitate tumor progression, by rendering cancer cells resistant to death mechanisms relevant to metastasis, hypoxia, growth factor-deprivation, chemotherapy, and irradiation.

The cells of a multicellular organism are members of a highly organized community. The number of cells in this community is tightly regulatedâ€”not simply by controlling the rate of cell division, but also by controlling the rate of cell death. The ability of cancer cells to evade apoptosis represents one of the fundamental hallmarks of malignancy and constitutes a critical step in tumor development and therapeutic resistance.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis and their dysregulation in cancer provides essential insights into both the biology of malignant transformation and potential therapeutic interventions. This chapter examines the major apoptotic pathways, explores how cancer cells circumvent these death mechanisms, and discusses emerging therapeutic strategies that target apoptotic machinery.
