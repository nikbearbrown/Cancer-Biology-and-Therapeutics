title: 10.1 Pathways of Apoptosis - Intrinsic and Extrinsic
---


Apoptosis is mediated by proteolytic enzymes called caspases, which trigger cell death by cleaving specific proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Caspases exist in all cells as inactive precursors, or procaspases, which are usually activated by cleavage by other caspases, producing a proteolytic caspase cascade. Two major pathways can initiate this cascade: the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway and the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway.

## 10.1.1 The Intrinsic Apoptotic Pathway

The intrinsic pathway, also known as the mitochondrial pathway, is activated in response to intracellular stress signals including DNA damage, oncogene activation, hypoxia, and withdrawal of survival factors. In the best understood pathway, mitochondria are induced to release the electron carrier protein cytochrome c into the cytosol, where it binds and activates an adaptor protein called Apaf-1.

**Key Components of the Intrinsic Pathway:**

1. **Bcl-2 Family Proteins**: The Bcl-2 family of intracellular proteins helps regulate the activation of procaspases. Some members of this family, like Bcl-2 itself or Bcl-XL, inhibit apoptosis, at least partly by blocking the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.

2. **Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members**: Other members of the Bcl-2 family are not death inhibitors, but instead promote procaspase activation and cell death. Some of these apoptosis promoters, such as Bad, function by binding to and inactivating the death-inhibiting members of the family, whereas others, like Bax and Bak, stimulate the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.

3. **Mitochondrial dysfunction**: If the genes encoding Bax and Bak are both inactivated, cells are remarkably resistant to most apoptosis-inducing stimuli, indicating the crucial importance of these proteins in apoptosis induction.

**Molecular Mechanism:**

The intrinsic pathway is initiated when cellular stress signals trigger the activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Upon apoptosis induction proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins with multidomains such as Bax or Bak translocate from the cytoplasm to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where they oligomerize to form a pore-like structure thereby promoting cytochrome c release.

Once released, cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 in the presence of ATP, forming a large protein complex called the apoptosome. The translocation to mitochondria can be triggered by so called "BH3-only" Bcl-2 family proteins. BH3-only proteins include Bid, which is activated by caspase-8-mediated cleavage, Bim, a microtubule-associated protein, or Noxa and PUMA, two p53-induced proteins. This apoptosome complex recruits and activates procaspase-9, which then cleaves and activates downstream executioner caspases-3 and -7.

## 10.1.2 The Extrinsic Apoptotic Pathway

The extrinsic pathway is initiated by the binding of death ligands to cell surface death receptors, providing a mechanism for external regulation of cell death. Procaspase activation can be triggered from outside the cell by the activation of death receptors on the cell surface. Killer lymphocytes, for example, can induce apoptosis by producing a protein called Fas ligand, which binds to the death receptor protein Fas on the surface of the target cell.

**Key Components of the Extrinsic Pathway:**

1. **Death Receptors**: Membrane death receptors belong to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily and include tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1 (TNF-R1/DR1), Fas (Apo-1/CD95/DR2), death receptor-4 (DR4) and -5 (DR5).

2. **Death Ligands**: These receptors are activated by specific ligands such as TNF-alpha, FasL and TNF-Related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL).

3. **Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC)**: Ligand binding leads to the recruitment of adapter proteins, activation of initiator caspases, and formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Stimulation of death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily such as CD95 (APO-1/Fas) or TRAIL receptors results in receptor aggregation and recruitment of the adaptor molecule Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase-8.

**Molecular Mechanism:**

The clustered Fas proteins then recruit intracellular adaptor proteins that bind and aggregate procaspase-8 molecules, which cleave and activate one another. The activated caspase-8 molecules then activate downstream procaspases to induce apoptosis. Upon recruitment caspase-8 becomes activated and initiates apoptosis by direct cleavage of downstream effector caspases.

## 10.1.3 Convergence and Cross-talk Between Pathways

The receptor and the mitochondrial pathway can be interconnected at different levels. Following death receptor stimulation activation of caspase-8 may result in cleavage of Bid, a BH3 domain containing protein of the Bcl-2 family which assumes cytochrome c-releasing activity upon cleavage thereby initiating a mitochondrial amplification loop.

Two main caspase cascades, one triggered by death receptor stimulation and the other one initiated at the mitochondria, have been identified in response to various inducers of cellular stress such as DNA damage. This cross-talk ensures robust apoptotic signaling and provides multiple checkpoints for regulation.
