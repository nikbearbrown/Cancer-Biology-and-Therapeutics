title: 10.3 Therapeutic Targeting of Apoptosis
---


Because apoptosis is the main cell death mechanism, targeting apoptotic pathways has a remarkable potential to overcome chemotherapy resistance. Different anticancer therapies including cytotoxic drugs, Î³-irradiation, suicide gene therapy, or immunotherapy appear to induce tumor cell death by activating key elements of apoptosis, the cell's intrinsic death program.

## 10.3.1 BCL-2 Inhibitors and BH3 Mimetics

Proof-of-concept experiments performed with synthetic peptides representing the BH3 domain have suggested a path forward in terms of drug discovery. For example, BH3 peptides directed against antiapoptotic proteins over-expressed in cancers (eg, Bcl-2; Bcl-XL) can restore sensitivity to apoptosis, at least in vitro. Accordingly, small-molecule chemical compounds have been delineated that interact with the same BH3-binding pocket on Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, nullifying their cytoprotective actions, and promoting tumor cell apoptosis.

**Clinical Development:**

Pan-BCL-2 inhibitor (-)BI97D6 suppressed MCL-1 and abolished ABT-737 resistance in AML. MCL-1 inhibitor, VU661013, induced apoptosis in venetoclax-resistant AML cells and patient-derived xenografts. Another MCL-1 inhibitor, S63845, killed MCL-1 dependent cancer cells by activating the BAX/BAK dependent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

## 10.3.2 IAP Antagonists

Synthetic peptides that mimic SMAC and HtrA2 induce apoptosis or sensitize tumor cell lines to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic anticancer drugs. Structural information derived from high-field NMR and x-ray crystallography indicate that a tetra-peptide motif is sufficient to bind the BIRs of IAPs, suggesting a path to drug discovery where small-molecule chemical compounds that occupy the same tetra-peptidebinding motif on BIRs can be envisioned as new apoptosis-sensitizing agents for cancer.

Castration-resistant prostate cancer cells were sensitized to enzalutamide using AEG40995 which is an IAP antagonist. AEG40995 degrades cIAP1 protein and combination with enzalutamide increases apoptosis via activation of caspase-8.

## 10.3.3 TRAIL and Death Receptor Agonists

TRAIL and agonists for TRAIL specific receptors, DR4 (TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (TRAIL-R2), are extrinsic pathway inducers that selectively kill tumor cells while harmless to the normal cells. Although they are very advantageous in this regard, inefficient receptor multimerization, poor pharmacokinetic properties, and tumor intrinsic resistance limit their usage in the clinical practice.

Increasing the killing capabilities of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is desired in treating cancer, and a variety of anticancer drugs increase Fas receptor expression in some tumor cell lines. The TNFRSF member TRAIL has shown some promise in being able to selectively kill cancer cells through binding to multiple receptors (DR4 and DR5). Yet, unfortunately, cancer cells have demonstrated the ability to obtain resistance to death by TRAIL.

## 10.3.4 p53 Restoration Strategies

p53 is mutated or functionally inactivated in many types of human cancer, and pharmacological restoration of wild-type p53 conformation and functions by small molecules targeting mutant p53 proteins was suggested as a strategy for design of anti-cancer drugs.

**Therapeutic Approaches:**

1. **Small molecule p53 activators**: Compounds that can restore wild-type p53 function in mutant cells
2. **MDM2 antagonists**: The major negative regulator of p53 is the Mdm2 proto-oncogene. Mdm2 is transcriptionally induced by p53, thus p53 triggers its own destruction through a negative feedback loop. Inhibiting this interaction can reactivate p53 signaling.

## 10.3.5 Combination Therapies and Resistance

Different classes of anticancer drugs initiate their cytotoxicities through a variety of primary molecular targets. Increasingly, however, the view is held that most, if not all, cancer drugs ultimately effect cell death via common downstream signaling pathways associated with programmed cell death or apoptosis.

Failure to activate apoptotic pathways in response to drug treatment may lead to resistance of tumors cells to anticancer therapies. Therefore, factors affecting caspase activation might be important determinants of drug sensitivity.

**Clinical Significance:**

Negative Bcl-2 expression was associated with good chemotherapy response in breast cancer patients. The results suggest that Bcl-2 expression is a predictive factor for chemotherapy sensitivity in breast cancer patients. BCL2 family members have remarkable potential as molecular prognostic markers to predict chemotherapy response in myeloma, leukemia, breast cancer, and solid tumors.
