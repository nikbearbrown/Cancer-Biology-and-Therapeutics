title: 10.2 Evasion of Apoptosis by Cancer Cells
---


Defects in normal programmed cell death mechanisms play a major role in the pathogenesis of tumors, allowing neoplastic cells to survive beyond their normally intended lifespans, subverting the need for exogenous survival factors, providing protection from hypoxia and oxidative stress as tumor mass expands, and allowing time for accumulative genetic alterations that deregulate cell proliferation, interfere with differentiation, promote angiogenesis, and increase cell motility and invasiveness during tumor progression.

## 10.2.1 Dysregulation of Bcl-2 Family Proteins

Alterations in the amounts of these proteins have been associated with cancer, including excess expression of antiapoptotic and reduced expression of pro-apoptotic BCL-2-family genes. For example, the BCL-2 gene (antiapoptotic) is activated by chromosomal translocations in the majority of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and is also inappropriately over-expressed in many solid tumors, contributing to resistance to chemotherapy- and radiation-induced apoptosis.

**Mechanisms of Bcl-2 Dysregulation:**

1. **Chromosomal Translocations**: Bcl-2 was the first member to be discovered when the encoding gene was found to be translocated in human follicular lymphoma. In follicular lymphoma, a translocation event relocates the Bcl-2 gene from chromosome 18 to chromosome 14, leading to excessive transcription and increased levels of Bcl-2. Elevated Bcl-2 gene levels inhibit APAF-1, consequently inactivating caspases and intrinsic apoptosis, leading to follicular lymphoma.

2. **Gene Amplification and Overexpression**: Bcl-2 protects cells from growth factor deprivation or against exposure to cytotoxic drugs, taxol, cisplatin, glucocorticoids or ionising radiation.

3. **Loss of Pro-apoptotic Members**: Conversely, loss-of-function mutations have been identified in the BAX genes (pro-apoptotic) of human tumors and analysis of bax-/- knock-out mice indicates that bax is a tumor suppressor in vivo.

## 10.2.2 p53 Mutations and Apoptosis Evasion

Mutations or deletions of the p53 gene increase the risk of tumor formation by enabling cells with damaged DNA to divide uncontrollably. Factors such as exposure to chemicals, radiation, and viruses can damage the p53 gene.

**p53-Mediated Apoptosis:**

In perhaps other settings, p53 appears to exert control over the cell's decision to undergo apoptosis or programmed cell death. p53 activates transcription of a number of genes with roles in the control of the cell cycle, including WAF1/CIP1/p21, GADD45, MDM2, and 14-3-3Ïƒ, as well as various genes that likely function in apoptosis, including BAX, NOXA, and PUMA.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a key role in the regulation of the cell cycle and cell death. Wild-type (wt) p53 and intact signaling pathways are essential for the prevention of cancer, consistent with a high tumor incidence observed in p53 null mice and in p53-heterozygous Li-Fraumeni patients.

## 10.2.3 Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs)

Another important family of intracellular apoptosis regulators is the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) family. These proteins are thought to inhibit apoptosis in two ways: they bind to some procaspases to prevent their activation, and they bind to caspases to inhibit their activity.

Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) family includes X-linked IAP (XIAP), cIAP1, cIAP2, ILP2, Bruce, Survivin, Livin and NAIP. Overexpression of these proteins lead to chemoresistance and poor prognosis.

## 10.2.4 Death Receptor Pathway Resistance

Decreased expression of death receptors was associated with reduced sensitivity to apoptosis in several cancers. For instance, transcriptional downregulation of FAS/CD95, constitutive endocytosis of DR4 and DR5, and decoy receptors are the potential sources of the resistance mechanism.
