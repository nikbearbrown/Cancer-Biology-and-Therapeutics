Apoptosis represents a fundamental cellular process whose dysregulation is central to cancer pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance. The intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are tightly regulated by multiple protein families, including Bcl-2 family members, IAPs, and caspases. Cancer cells employ various strategies to evade apoptosis, including overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins, loss of pro-apoptotic factors, and mutations in key regulators like p53.

Understanding these mechanisms has led to the development of targeted therapeutic approaches, including BH3 mimetics, IAP antagonists, and death receptor agonists. While significant progress has been made, cancer cell resistance to apoptosis-inducing therapies remains a major clinical challenge. Future therapeutic strategies will likely involve combination approaches that target multiple apoptotic pathways simultaneously, potentially overcoming the redundancy and plasticity that cancer cells exploit to survive.

The continued elucidation of apoptotic mechanisms and their dysregulation in cancer provides ongoing opportunities for therapeutic intervention, offering hope for more effective cancer treatments that can overcome the fundamental ability of cancer cells to evade programmed cell death.
