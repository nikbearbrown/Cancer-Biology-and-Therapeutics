# Chapter 32: Central Nervous System Tumors

Central nervous system (CNS) tumors represent a diverse group of neoplasms that originate within the brain and spinal cord. These tumors present unique challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to their location within the anatomically complex and functionally critical nervous system. In 2018, cancer of the brain and central nervous system was the 17th most common cancer type, with an estimated 297,000 new cases worldwide. Understanding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical management of CNS tumors is essential for healthcare providers, as these conditions significantly impact patient quality of life and require specialized multidisciplinary care.

About 68% of all brain and central nervous system tumours are non-malignant; about half of these tumours are meningiomas, followed by pituitary tumours and nerve sheath tumours. Among the malignant tumours, heterogeneity is also substantial; almost half of these are glioblastomas, followed by other gliomas. This chapter focuses on the two most clinically significant CNS tumors: glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive primary brain tumor, and meningiomas, the most common non-malignant brain tumor.

## 32.1 Glioblastoma Multiforme

### 32.1.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) comprises glioma's most malignant and pervasive subtype. GBM is the most common primary brain tumor in adults, accounting for 45.2% of primary malignant brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors. There are an estimated 80,000 to 90,000 newly diagnosed cases of primary brain tumors each year in the United States, with approximately 25% being gliomas. The total number of glioblastoma cases diagnosed each year is about 12,000 (approximately 15% of the total of newly diagnosed brain tumors and roughly 50% of all malignant brain tumors).

**Age and Gender Distribution**:
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor. With an incidence rate of 3.19 per 100,000 persons in the United States and a median age of 64 years, it is uncommon in children. The incidence is 1.6 times higher in males compared to females and 2.0 times higher in Caucasians compared to Africans and Afro-Americans, with lower incidence in Asians and American Indians.

**Anatomical Distribution**:
GBM is commonly located in the supratentorial region (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes) and is rarely located in cerebellum. Overall, the incidence of GBM is higher in males than in females (3.97 vs. 2.53 in the United States).

**Risk Factors**:
The only well-established causative factor is exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation. Results from some epidemiological studies suggest that ionizing radiation can increase the chance of developing gliomas. Gliomas most often present in patients without any relevant history; however, some patients may have tumor-predisposition syndromes. The phacomatoses such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2 predispose patients to astrocytomas and ependymomas, respectively.

### 32.1.2 Pathophysiology and Molecular Biology

**Cellular Origin and Classification**:
Due to different triggering mutations and critical mutations in the GBM stem cells, GBM is classified into primary tumors arising from neural stem cell precursors and secondary tumors arising from mutations in mature neural cells like astrocytes. Glioblastoma is an extremely aggressive form of cancer most commonly derived from neural stem cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes that occurs in the brain and has a 5-year survival rate of 6.7%.

**Molecular Subtyping**:
The classification of GBM based on gene expression distinguishes between four subtypes: proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal. Aberrations and gene expression of EGFR, NF1, and PDGFRA/IDH1 define classical, mesenchymal, and proneural GBMs, respectively. Genes of normal brain cell types show a strong relationship between subtypes and different neural lineages and the response to aggressive treatment differs by subtype, with prominent benefits in the classical and little or no benefit in the proneural subtype.

**IDH Mutations**:
Interestingly, IDH1 mutations are also found in 80% of diffuse astrocytoma and anaplastic astrocytoma, the precursors of secondary GBM, and in less than 5% of primary GBM. According to the WHO 2021 recommendations for central nervous system tumors, astrocytomas are now diagnosed solely by IDH mutations. New to the 2021 recommendations, glioblastomas are now only IDH-wildtype tumors and no longer classified as IDH-mutant.

**Tumor Heterogeneity**:
Alteration in genetic information, causing expression and suppression of genes compared to their physiological levels in healthy brain cells, leads to cellular and extracellular matrix changes, resulting in a multiform number of biochemical forms. Hence, the name multiforme is due to the extent of genotypic diversity. Glioblastomas are complex heterogeneous tumors that have the ability to adapt and build resistance against existing treatments.

### 32.1.3 Clinical Presentation

**Symptom Categories**:
A thorough history of patients with astrocytoma is a critical component of the diagnostic process, providing valuable insights into symptoms' onset, progression, and nature. Symptoms can be divided into 2 categories: general and focal. General symptoms include headache (usually early morning), nausea, vomiting, cognitive difficulties, personality changes, and gait disorders. Localizing symptoms include seizures, aphasia, or visual field defects.

**Specific Manifestations**:
The most common symptoms of glioblastomas are loss of vision, numbness, and headaches, usually accompanied by nausea or vomiting. These symptoms may be overlooked or mistaken for another disease, which is why glioblastomas are commonly detected in later stages when they begin their widespread infiltration of the brain.

**Seizures and Neurological Deficits**:
About 50% of patients with supratentorial brain tumors may present with seizures. A visual field defect is often unnoticed by the patient and may be revealed after it leads to injury, such as motor vehicle accidents. Once the tumors have developed, 60% of patients experience short seizures, between 2–3 minutes of duration, and suffer from fatigue, confusion, and numbness once the seizure has concluded.

### 32.1.4 Diagnostic Approaches

Neuroimaging: The Cornerstone of Diagnosis

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) serves as the primary diagnostic modality for glioblastoma and other CNS tumors. Upon patient presentation with subacute and progressive neurologic signs and symptoms, gadolinium-enhanced cranial MRI is essential for diagnosing brain abnormalities, assessing tumor extent, and guiding treatment planning.

### Standard MRI Sequences and Characteristic Features

**T1-Weighted Imaging:**

*Pre-Contrast Characteristics:*

*Distinguishing True Progression from Pseudoprogression:*

- **Critical Clinical Challenge:** Differentiation between tumor recurrence and treatment-related changes
  
- **Pseudoprogression:** Subacute worsening of MRI findings within 3 months after chemoradiotherapy completion
  
  - Treatment-related effect, not true tumor progression
  - Occurs in 20-30% of patients
- **ADC Values for Differentiation:**
  
  - Mean ADC in true recurrence: ~848 × 10⁻⁶ mm²/s (restricted diffusion)
  - Mean ADC in pseudoprogression: ~1355 × 10⁻⁶ mm²/s (facilitated diffusion)
  - Lower ADC values indicating higher cellularity and true progression
  - Institutional validation of cut-off values warranted
  - Critical for enrollment in salvage clinical trials and outcome reporting

**MR Spectroscopy (MRS):**

*Metabolite Analysis:*

### 32.1.5 Treatment Strategies

Standard of Care: The Stupp Protocol

The landmark 2005 EORTC-NCIC trial established the current gold standard for newly diagnosed glioblastoma treatment, known as the Stupp protocol. This multimodal approach significantly improved median survival from 12.1 months with radiation alone to 14.6 months with combined chemoradiotherapy, with 5-year survival increasing from 1.9% to 9.8%.

### Surgical Management: Maximal Safe Resection

**Goals and Principles:**

*Primary Objectives:*

- **Cytoreduction:** Decrease tumor burden to enhance efficacy of adjuvant therapies
- **Symptom relief:** Reduce mass effect, lower intracranial pressure
- **Tissue diagnosis:** Obtain material for histopathologic and molecular characterization
- **Neurological preservation:** Maintain or improve functional status

*Extent of Resection Impact:*

- **Gross total resection (GTR):** Complete removal of contrast-enhancing tumor
  
  - Associated with improved survival vs subtotal resection (STR) or biopsy

- Use declining with improved systemic therapies

### Radiation Therapy

**Standard External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT):**

*Dose and Fractionation:*

- **Standard regimen:** 60 Gy in 30 fractions (2 Gy per fraction) over 6 weeks
- Optimal schedule for patients <70 years with good performance status (KPS ≥60)
- Fractionation allowing normal brain tissue repair between doses
- Tumor cells less efficient at DNA damage repair

*Target Volume Delineation:*

- Gross tumor volume (GTV): Contrast-enhancing tumor plus resection cavity
- Clinical target volume (CTV): GTV + 2-3 cm margin for infiltrative disease
- Planning target volume (PTV): CTV + setup margin
- Critical structure dose constraints (brainstem <54 Gy, optic nerves/chiasm <54 Gy)
- **QUANTEC guidelines:** No clinical indication for fractionated RT >60 Gy for brain tumors

*Modern Techniques:*

- **Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT):** Conforming high-dose region to tumor while sparing normal brain
- **Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT):** Faster delivery, improved dose distributions
- Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) ensuring accuracy

**Hypofractionated Radiation for Elderly/Poor Performance Status:**

- **Shorter courses** for patients >65-70 years or poor performance status
- 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks
- 34 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks

Temozolomide is a second-generation oral alkylating agent, dacarbazine derivative:

*Pharmacology:*

- **Bioavailability:** 100% after oral administration
- **BBB penetration:** ~35% crosses blood-brain barrier
- **Conversion:** Nonenzymatic conversion to active metabolite MTIC (3-methyl-(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide) at physiologic pH
- **DNA damage:** Methylation at O⁶ and N⁷ positions of guanine
  - O⁶-methylguanine most cytotoxic lesion
  - Mismatch during DNA replication triggering apoptosis

**Clinical Regimen (Stupp Protocol):**

*Concurrent Phase (with Radiation):*

- **Dosing:** 75 mg/m² daily, 7 days per week during 6-week radiation course

- Lomustine (CCNU), carmustine (BCNU)
- Irinotecan
- Carboplatin
- Rechallenge with temozolomide if prolonged interval
- Modest efficacy, palliative intent

**Clinical Trials:**

- Strongly encouraged for recurrent disease
- Immunotherapy approaches (checkpoint inhibitors, vaccines, CAR-T cells)
- Novel targeted therapies
- Combination strategies

**Supportive Care:**

- May be most appropriate for heavily pretreated patients with declining performance status
- Hospice referral for end-of-life care
- Focus on quality of life and symptom management

### Elderly and Poor Performance Status Patients

**Age-Specific Considerations:**

*Elderly Patients (>65-70 years):*

- Often cannot tolerate standard intensive therapy
- Modified approaches:
  - **Hypofractionated radiation alone:** 40 Gy in 15 fractions
  - **Temozolomide alone:** For MGMT-methylated tumors
  - **Abbreviated chemoradiation:** Combining shortened radiation with TMZ
- Individualized decisions based on functional status, comorbidities, patient/family preferences

*Poor Performance Status (KPS <60-70):*

- Best supportive care may be appropriate
- Limited-course radiation for symptom palliation
- Short-course TMZ
- Avoid aggressive interventions unlikely to benefit

### Emerging Therapies Under Investigation

**Immunotherapy:**

- Checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4)
- Tumor vaccines (peptide, dendritic cell-based)
- CAR-T cell therapy targeting IL13Rα2, EGFRvIII
- Oncolytic viruses
- Results generally disappointing in phase 3 trials to date

**Targeted Molecular Therapies:**

- EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib)
- EGFRvIII-targeted antibodies
- VEGFR inhibitors (cediranib, cabozantinib, sunitinib)
- mTOR inhibitors
- Most failed to improve outcomes in unselected populations
- Precision approaches targeting specific molecular subsets needed

**Novel Delivery Methods:**

- Convection-enhanced delivery
- Focused ultrasound for BBB disruption
- Nanoparticle-based delivery systems

### 32.1.6 Prognosis and Complications

**Survival Outcomes**:
It remains an incurable disease with a median survival of 15 months and has been classified into wild-type and mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) subtypes. The average survival for patients is approximately 12–15 months, and relative survival is extremely low, with less than 5% of all patients surviving 5 years post-diagnosis, with this value decreasing to 2% among patients aged 65 years or older.

**Recurrence Patterns**:
Recurrence after GTR and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy mainly occurs within the peritumoral brain zone (PBZ) bearing the malignant microenvironment containing tumor cells, angiogenesis-related endothelial cells, reactive astrocytes, glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and glioma-associated stromal cells (GASCs). High local recurrence rates (80% to 90%) are observed within 2 cm of the original tumor.

**Treatment-Related Complications**:
GBM is usually associated with pseudoprogression or radionecrosis, which is a subacute worsening of MRI findings that occur within 3 months after the completion of chemoradiotherapy. It is a treatment-related effect. The risk of surgical site infection increases with irradiation and multiple surgeries.

### 32.1.7 Pediatric Considerations

**Epidemiology in Children**:
Glioblastoma in children, when compared with adults, is relatively rare. In contrast, GBM accounts for no more than 3–15% of primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors in children. This is despite the fact that CNS tumors are the most common solid tumors of childhood, and 40–50% of these tumors are constituted by the astrocytomas.

**Prognosis in Children**:
The reported median survival in p-GBM ranges from 13 to 73 months with a 5-year survival of less than 20%. A few reports, however, reveal a relatively better prognosis and long-term survival figures in p-GBM as compared with adults.

## 32.2 Meningiomas

### 32.2.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors

**Incidence and Demographics**:
Meningioma is a known benign central nervous system tumor commonly arising from the meninges of the brain and spinal cord. About 68% of all brain and central nervous system tumours are non-malignant; about half of these tumours are meningiomas, followed by pituitary tumours and nerve sheath tumours.

**Risk Factors**:
Although obesity has not been consistently associated with risk of glioma, there is a consensus that obesity is associated with risk of meningioma. Various genetic susceptibility loci have been identified for gliomas, and two distinct susceptibility loci have been associated with meningiomas.

**Ionizing Radiation**:
Ionizing radiation and the risk of brain and central nervous system tumors represents a well-established risk factor for meningioma development.

### 32.2.2 Pathophysiology and Classification

**Cellular Origin**:
Intraventricular meningiomas show similar characteristics to those found in the extra-axial space. Their cells of origin are the same; however, extra-axial meningiomas are derived from the arachnoid cap cells, naturally occurring near venous sinuses and dural edges. Intraventricular meningiomas originate from the choroid plexus' stroma and arise at the tela choroidea.

**WHO Grading System**:
Meningioma is classified into three grades, according to the World Health Organization. Most meningiomas are considered to be benign World Health Organization (WHO) grade I, slow-growing lesions.

**Grade I (Benign)**:
The majority of meningiomas are WHO Grade I tumors, characterized by slow growth and favorable prognosis with complete surgical resection.

**Grade II (Atypical)**:
Grade 2 are atypical lesions characterized by three or more of the following: necrosis, sheet-like growth, prominent nuclei, increased cellularity, or high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio. An increased mitotic activity (4-19 mitoses per 10 high-power fields) will also indicate an atypical tumor. A meningioma with brain invasion is now considered a grade 2 tumor.

**Grade III (Anaplastic)**:
Grade 3 are anaplastic, malignant lesions that can be similar to high-grade sarcomas, carcinoma, or melanomas with a high rate of distant metastases. A high mitotic activity (20 or more mitoses per 10 high-power fields) will also indicate a grade 3 lesion.

**Cystic Variants**:
Cystic meningioma represents a meningioma with intratumoral or peritumoral cysts. The classification system includes four types based on cyst location and characteristics.

### 32.2.3 Clinical Presentation

General Characteristics

The clinical presentation of meningiomas is highly variable and primarily determined by tumor location, size, growth rate, and associated mass effect on adjacent neural structures. A substantial proportion of meningiomas remain asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally on neuroimaging performed for unrelated indications.

### Asymptomatic Incidental Meningiomas

**Detection Patterns:**

With increasing use of sensitive neuroimaging tools (MRI, CT):

- Detection of asymptomatic, low-grade meningiomas has increased dramatically
- Estimated 1-2% of general population harbor asymptomatic meningiomas
- Most show minimal or no growth over time
- Can be safely observed with serial imaging
- Therapy deferred until tumor growth or symptom development

**Observation Strategy:**

- Annual MRI initially for incidentally diagnosed, asymptomatic tumors (evidence level III, recommendation level C)
- If remaining stable and asymptomatic: Continue annual surveillance for 5 years
- After 5 years of stability: Surveillance intervals can be prolonged
- Some patients demonstrate clinical stability despite imaging evidence of tumor growth
- Patient age, life expectancy, and clinical condition influencing follow-up intervals

### Symptomatic Meningiomas

**General Symptoms:**

Symptomatic meningiomas typically require surgical intervention to reduce recurrence risk and disease severity:

*Common Presentations:*

- **Headaches:** Often progressive, may be positional
- **Seizures:** Occur in 20-40% of patients, particularly with supratentorial meningiomas involving cortex
- **Cognitive impairment:** Subtle changes in memory, executive function, processing speed
  - Presence argues in favor of intervention even if tumor small
  - Often reversible with tumor removal
- **Personality changes:** Frontal lobe tumors particularly
- **Focal neurological deficits:** Dependent on location

### Location-Specific Clinical Presentations

**Convexity Meningiomas:**

- Seizures most common
- Focal motor or sensory deficits
- Headaches
- Cognitive changes if frontal

**Parasagittal and Falcine Meningiomas:**

- Lower extremity weakness (leg motor involvement)
- Gait disturbances
- Seizures
- May compress superior sagittal sinus affecting venous drainage

**Sphenoid Wing Meningiomas:**

- **Medial third:** Visual deficits, optic nerve compression, cavernous sinus syndrome
- **Middle third:** Temporal lobe symptoms, seizures
- **Lateral third:** Temporal lobe involvement, bone hyperostosis

**Olfactory Groove Meningiomas:**

- Anosmia (loss of smell) - often unnoticed by patients
- Personality changes, disinhibition
- Visual disturbances
- Kennedy syndrome (ipsilateral optic atrophy, contralateral papilledema)

**Tuberculum Sellae Meningiomas:**

- Visual loss (compression of optic nerves/chiasm)
- Bitemporal hemianopsia
- Optic atrophy
- Endocrine dysfunction if pituitary involvement

**Posterior Fossa Meningiomas:**

- Cerebellar symptoms: Ataxia, incoordination
- Cranial nerve palsies (V, VII, VIII)
- Hydrocephalus from fourth ventricle compression
- Brainstem compression

**Cerebellopontine Angle Meningiomas:**

- Hearing loss, tinnitus (CN VIII)
- Facial numbness/weakness (CN V, VII)
- Balance problems
- Often confused with acoustic schwannoma

**Intraventricular Meningiomas:**

*Unique Features:*

- Originate from choroid plexus stroma, tela choroidea
- **Location-specific symptoms:**
  - Lateral ventricle: Headaches, hydrocephalus, cognitive changes
  - Third ventricle: Obstructive hydrocephalus, endocrine dysfunction
  - Fourth ventricle: Hydrocephalus, ataxia, cranial nerve palsies

*Management Algorithm:*

- **Small asymptomatic lesions (<3 cm):** Close MRI surveillance
  
  - Every 6 months for 1-2 years
  - Then annually if stable
- **Large asymptomatic lesions (>3 cm) in young, good surgical candidates:**
  
  - Gross total resection recommended
  - Curative in most cases
  - Prevents future symptomatic progression
- **Symptomatic lesions:** Surgical intervention regardless of size
  

**Optic Nerve Sheath Meningiomas (ONSM):**

*Natural History:*

- Slowly progressive, painless visual loss in affected eye
- Can lead to complete blindness if untreated
- **Classic triad:** Visual loss, optic atrophy, optociliary shunt vessels
  - Most patients do not present with all three components
  - Optociliary vessels pathognomonic but rare

*Clinical Course:*

- Some demonstrate stability without treatment intervention
- Others show rapid vision loss without tumor size increase
- Unpredictable progression patterns
- Patient education critical regarding slowly progressive nature

*Management Considerations:*

- Surgery risks worsening vision due to optic nerve manipulation
- Radiation therapy often preferred for symptomatic ONSM
- Observation for stable, good vision
- Individualized approach based on vision status, tumor growth, patient preferences

### Pregnancy-Related Considerations

**Hormonal Influences:**

- Meningiomas may grow during pregnancy due to female hormone influence
- Progesterone and estrogen receptors expressed in many meningiomas
- Usually slow postpartum
- Observation during pregnancy if asymptomatic
- Surgery deferred to postpartum period when safe

**Contraceptive and Hormone Therapy:**

- Oral contraceptive pills and hormonal replacement therapy associated with increased meningioma risk
- Consider discontinuation in patients with known meningiomas
- Risk-benefit assessment individualized

### Symptom Progression and Urgency

**Acute Presentations:**

Rare but requiring emergency intervention:

- Rapid neurological deterioration
- Hemorrhage into tumor (apoplexy)
- Obstructive hydrocephalus
- Herniation syndromes
- Seizure clusters or status epilepticus

**Subacute/Chronic:**

- Gradual symptom onset over weeks to months more typical
- Progressive neurological decline
- Increasing mass effect
- Timing of intervention based on symptom severity and rate of progression
  
### 32.2.4 Diagnostic Approaches

Neuroimaging

**MRI: Imaging Modality of Choice**

*T1-Weighted Imaging:*

- Isointense to hypointense relative to gray matter
- **Post-gadolinium:** Intense, homogeneous enhancement (classic feature)
  - "Dural tail" sign: Thickening and enhancement of adjacent dura extending from tumor base
  - Not specific for meningioma but characteristic
  - Represents dural invasion, reactive changes, or tumor spread along dura

*T2-Weighted/FLAIR Imaging:*

- Variable signal intensity (isointense to hyperintense)
- Peritumoral edema assessment
- Extent of edema not always correlating with tumor size
- Vasogenic edema pattern

*Characteristic Features:*

- Extra-axial location (arising from meninges, not brain parenchyma)
- Broad dural base
- CSF cleft between tumor and brain (when present)
- Smooth, lobulated borders typical for benign meningiomas
- Mass effect on adjacent brain
- Calvarial changes (hyperostosis or erosion)

**CT Imaging:**

*Utility:*

- Rapid assessment in emergency settings
- Excellent for detecting calcification (present in 20-25% of meningiomas)
- Bone window evaluation: Hyperostosis (bone thickening) or erosion
- Post-contrast: Enhancement similar to MRI

*Limitations:*

- Inferior soft tissue contrast compared to MRI
- Less sensitive for small tumors
- Posterior fossa artifacts

### Advanced Imaging Modalities

**Somatostatin Receptor Imaging (DOTATATE/DOTATOC PET):**

*Molecular Imaging:*

- Meningiomas express somatostatin receptors (particularly SSTR2A)
- **⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE or ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT:**
  - High sensitivity and specificity for detecting meningioma tissue
  - Superior to MRI for identifying occult lesions
  - Useful for surgical planning and radiotherapy design
  - Differentiating meningioma from other tumors (metastases, schwannomas)
  - Identifying multiple meningiomas

*Clinical Applications:*

- Evaluating extent of skull base involvement
- Detecting residual tumor after surgery
- Assessing tumor biology (high uptake correlating with WHO grade in some studies)
- Potential for targeted radionuclide therapy (¹⁷⁷Lu-DOTATATE)

**MR Spectroscopy:**

- Generally less useful than in gliomas
- May show elevated alanine peak (characteristic but not specific)
- Absence of NAA (neuronal marker) supporting extra-axial location
- Can help differentiate from intra-axial tumors

**Perfusion Imaging:**

- Assessment of tumor vascularity
- Higher-grade meningiomas showing increased perfusion
- Helps predict WHO grade preoperatively

### Histopathological Diagnosis

**Tissue Acquisition:**

*Surgical Resection:*

- Provides definitive diagnosis and treatment
- Complete tissue assessment enabling accurate grading
- **Tissue preservation:** EANO guidelines recommend storing tissue for molecular diagnostics and future targeted therapies

*Stereotactic Biopsy:*

- Reserved for unresectable tumors or when diagnosis uncertain
- Sampling error risk due to tumor heterogeneity
- Generally avoided if imaging diagnosis clear and observation planned

**Histopathologic Features:**

*WHO Grade I (Benign):*

- Organized architecture with fascicular, syncytial, transitional, or psammomatous patterns
- Meningothelial cells with bland nuclear features
- Low mitotic activity (<4 mitoses per 10 high-power fields)
- No invasion into brain parenchyma (pre-2021 classification)
- Psammoma bodies (calcified structures) often present

*WHO Grade II (Atypical):*

- **Criteria (requires ≥3 of following OR ≥4 mitoses per 10 HPF):**
  
  - Increased cellularity (sheeting pattern)
  - High nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio
  - Prominent nucleoli
  - Patternless or sheet-like growth
  - Spontaneous necrosis (not infarct-type)
- **Brain invasion:** Now criterion for Grade II (2021 WHO update)
  
  - Even if other features benign
  - Significant for prognosis and treatment planning

*WHO Grade III (Anaplastic/Malignant):*

- **Criteria:**
  
  - ≥20 mitoses per 10 high-power fields, OR
  - Frank malignant histology (resembling sarcoma, carcinoma, melanoma), OR
  - **Molecular markers:** TERT promoter mutation or homozygous CDKN2A/B deletion
    - 2021 WHO update: Independent criteria for Grade III diagnosis
    - Regardless of histologic features
    - Recognizing molecular drivers of aggressive behavior
- High rate of local recurrence and distant metastases (rare but documented)
  

### Molecular and Genetic Characterization

**Emerging Molecular Classification:**

Remarkable progress in understanding meningioma biology over past decade:

*Common Genetic Alterations:*

- **NF2 (Neurofibromin 2) mutations/loss:** 40-60% of sporadic meningiomas
  
  - Chromosome 22q loss
  - Associated with multiple and recurrent meningiomas
  - Poorer prognosis
- **AKT1 E17K mutation:** 5-10%, associated with meningothelial meningiomas, skull base location
  
- **SMO mutations:** ~5%, associated with medial skull base, potential therapeutic target (hedgehog pathway inhibitors)
  
- **TRAF7 mutations:** Often co-occurring with AKT1 or KLF4 mutations
  
- **TERT promoter mutations:** High-risk feature, criterion for Grade III
  
- **CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion:** High-risk, criterion for Grade III
  

*Methylation Profiling:*

- DNA methylation-based classification identifying prognostic subgroups
- Integration with histopathology improving risk stratification
- Guiding treatment intensity

**Proliferation Index:**

- **MIB-1 (Ki-67) labeling index:** Percentage of proliferating cells
- Higher index correlating with increased recurrence risk
- Typical values:
  - WHO I: <4% (mean ~3-5%)
  - WHO II: 4-20% range
  - WHO III: Often >20%
- Some WHO I tumors with ≥5% staining showing more aggressive behavior

### Differential Diagnosis

**Conditions Mimicking Meningioma:**

*Imaging Differential:*

- Schwannoma (particularly at cerebellopontine angle)
- Solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma
- Dural metastases (breast, prostate, lung)
- Lymphoma
- Sarcoidosis with dural involvement

*Rapidly Growing Lesion During Observation:*

- Suspect higher-grade meningioma
- Metastasis in particular clinical contexts
- Biopsy or resection for diagnosis

### 32.2.5 Treatment Strategies

Risk-Stratified Treatment Approach

Treatment paradigm based on WHO grade, extent of resection, molecular features, and clinical factors (symptoms, location, patient fitness).

### WHO Grade I Meningiomas

**Asymptomatic, Incidentally Discovered:**

*Observation (First-Line Strategy):*

- **Recommendation:** Watch-and-wait approach (EANO guidelines evidence level III, recommendation level C)
- **Surveillance protocol:**
  - Annual MRI initially
  - Clinical neurological examinations
  - Special attention to cognitive function (subtle impairment may indicate need for intervention)
  - If patient's life expectancy short: Follow-up may not be necessary

*Indications for Treatment:*

- Tumor growth documented on serial imaging
- Development of symptoms
- Patient anxiety or preference for active intervention

**Symptomatic or Growing Meningiomas:**

***Surgery (First-Line Treatment):***

*Rationale for Surgical Approach:*

- Patient often cured by Simpson Grade I resection
- Neurological and cognitive symptoms may be reversed
- Tissue-based diagnosis confirmed
- Tissue obtained for molecular pathologic testing and future targeted therapy potential
- Removes mass effect

*Simpson Grading System (1957, Surgical Resection Extent):*

- **Grade I:** Complete tumor removal + dural attachment + abnormal bone
  
  - Optimal resection, lowest recurrence (~9% at 10 years)
- **Grade II:** Complete tumor removal + coagulation of dural attachment
  
  - Recurrence ~19% at 10 years
- **Grade III:** Complete tumor removal, no dural coagulation/resection
  
  - Recurrence ~29% at 10 years
- **Grade IV:** Subtotal resection (partial removal)
  
  - Recurrence ~40% at 10 years
- **Grade V:** Simple decompression ± biopsy
  
  - Highest recurrence rates

*Surgical Considerations:*

- Complete resection when safely achievable
- Eloquent location, vascular involvement (venous sinus), or skull base may preclude Simpson I/II
- Minimally invasive techniques when appropriate
- Preoperative embolization for highly vascular tumors

***Radiation Therapy (Alternative or Adjuvant):***

*Definitive Radiation for Unresectable Tumors:*

- **Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS):**
  
  - Single high-dose session (12-18 Gy)
  - For tumors <3-4 cm diameter
  - Away from critical structures (optic apparatus, brainstem)
  - Excellent local control rates (>90% at 5-10 years)
  - Minimal toxicity
  - Gamma Knife, CyberKnife, or LINAC-based
- **Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SRT):**
  
  - Multiple smaller fractions over 1-4 weeks
  - For larger tumors or near critical structures
  - Enables higher total dose with acceptable toxicity
  - 50-54 Gy in 25-30 fractions typical

*Adjuvant Radiation After Subtotal Resection (STR):*

- Improves local control
- May delay or prevent recurrence requiring additional surgery
- Simpson Grade IV-V resections: Radiation recommended
- Simpson Grade II-III: Controversial, often observed initially

*Patient Unsuitable for Surgery:*

- Elderly or significantly disabled patients
- Medical comorbidities precluding anesthesia
- Patient preference
- Radiation therapy providing disease control without surgical risks

**Follow-Up After Treatment:**

*Surveillance Protocol:*

- Annual MRI recommended for 5 years after treatment
- Thereafter, intervals prolonged according to age and clinical condition
- Neurological evaluations
- Earlier imaging if new symptoms develop

### WHO Grade II (Atypical) Meningiomas

**Treatment Principles:**

Therapy mandatory due to increased recurrence risk (29-52% recurrence rates):

**Surgery:**

*Goals:*

- Obtain tissue for diagnosis and grading
- Remove mass effect
- Achieve Simpson Grade I resection when possible
- Recognition that surgery alone often inadequate

**Adjuvant Radiation Therapy:**

*Controversy and Ongoing Trials:*

- **Question:** Does adjuvant RT after GTR reduce recurrence in Grade II meningioma?
- **Conflicting observational data:**
  - Some studies showing progression-free survival benefit
  - RT potentially avoiding future surgeries
  - Counterbalanced by chronic radiation-induced side effects

*Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews:*

- Song et al. (24 studies, n=3,078): Postoperative RT improved PFS regardless of resection extent
  
  - After STR: Pooled HR 0.41
  - After GTR: HR 0.73
- Bray et al. (Emory series, n=162): Adjuvant RT after resection
  
  - 90% recurrence-free at 5 years with RT
  - 50-60% without RT
  - 89% patients received >59 Gy (most 59.4 Gy)

*Current Recommendations (Pending Trial Results):*

- **After GTR:** Intimate follow-up recommended (6-month intervals for 5 years)
  
  - Observation vs adjuvant RT controversial
  - RT considered for high-risk features
- **After STR:** Stereotactic radiosurgery or fractionated radiotherapy recommended
  
  - Dose: 54-60 Gy fractionated RT
  - Local control rates significantly improved with RT

*Ongoing Randomized Trials:*

- **NRG BN-003 (North America):** RT (59.4 Gy/33 fractions) vs observation after GTR of WHO Grade II
- **ROAM/EORTC-1308 (Europe):** RT (60 Gy/30 fractions) vs observation after GTR
- Results will definitively answer adjuvant RT question
- **RTOG 0539 (Completed):** Risk-stratified approach
  - Low-risk (WHO I after GTR): Observation
  - Intermediate-risk: 54 Gy RT
  - High-risk (all WHO II-III): 60 Gy RT
  - Group 2 (intermediate): 3-year PFS 93.8%
  - Group 3 (high-risk): 3-year PFS 58.8%

### WHO Grade III (Anaplastic/Malignant) Meningiomas

**Aggressive Treatment Approach:**

Recurrence rates 50-94%, overall survival significantly reduced:

**Surgery + Adjuvant Radiation:**

*Standard Recommendation:*

- Maximal safe resection
- **Adjuvant radiation therapy mandatory** regardless of resection extent
  - Reduces recurrence risk
  - Improves survival
- Dose: 60 Gy in 30-33 fractions (fractionated RT)

*Treatment Planning:*

- IMRT (intensity-modulated radiation therapy) to minimize normal brain exposure
- All areas of abnormal dura incorporated into clinical target volume
- Generous margins given invasive nature

**Systemic Therapy for Unresectable/Recurrent Disease:**

*Limited Effective Options:*

- ~20% of patients cannot undergo further surgery/radiation
- Systemic therapy role in this setting

*Chemotherapy (Modest Results):*

- **Hydroxyurea:** Phase II study (n=60, recurrent Grade I)
  
  - No radiological responses
  - Disease control rate 35%
  - Median PFS only 2 months
- **Temozolomide:** Phase II study (n=43, Grades I-II)
  
  - Objective response rate 5%
  - Disease control rate 36%
  - All patients progressed after first 2 cycles
  - Median OS 7 months
- **Irinotecan:** Phase II after surgery/RT failure
  
  - Minimal efficacy

*Targeted Therapies Under Investigation:*

- **Bevacizumab (Anti-VEGF):**
  
  - Most promising systemic agent to date
  - Modest objective response rates
  - Disease stabilization in some patients
  - Encouraging results in recurrent/progressive meningiomas
- **Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors:**
  
  - Gefitinib, erlotinib (EGFR inhibitors): Unsatisfactory results
  - Sunitinib (multi-kinase inhibitor): Negative or limited efficacy
- **SMO Inhibitors:** For SMO-mutant meningiomas (hedgehog pathway)
  

**Immunotherapy:**

- Immune checkpoint inhibitors tested
- Modest objective response rates reported
- Further trials needed
- Not yet standard of care

### Radiation-Induced Meningiomas

**Special Considerations:**

*Characteristics:*

- Develop after cranial radiation (often childhood cancer treatment)
- Mean latency ~26 years (range 8-51 years)
- Mean radiation dose ~34 Gy (range 16-60 Gy)
- Multiple tumors more common than sporadic meningiomas
- Younger age at diagnosis
- Higher rates of Grade II histology (42.9% vs ~20% in sporadic)
- Calvarial location predilection

*Management:*

- Complete surgical resection preferred and safer when feasible
- Caution with additional radiation (cumulative dose considerations)
- SRS may be appropriate for small, focal recurrences
- Higher recurrence risk requiring vigilant surveillance

### Treatment Modality Selection

**Decision Framework:**

*Factors Influencing Choice:*

**Physical Factors:**

- Tumor size (<3 cm favors SRS, >3 cm may require SRT or surgery)
- Proximity to critical structures (optic apparatus, brainstem)
- Optimal achievable dose with acceptable toxicity

**Biological Factors:**

- WHO grade and histology
- Proliferation index (Ki-67)
- Molecular features (TERT, CDKN2A/B status)
- Use of systemic drugs

**Clinical Factors:**

- Patient age and life expectancy
- Performance status and comorbidities
- Symptom burden
- Previous treatments
- Patient preferences

**Technique Comparison (SRS vs SRT for Atypical Meningiomas):**

- Study of 50 patients with atypical meningiomas (mean follow-up 86 months):
  - SRS (n=21): 2-year and 5-year local control 91% and 88%
  - SRT (n=29): 2-year and 5-year local control 71% and 69%
  - No significant difference
  - Selection factors (size, location) influencing modality choice

**Particle Therapy:**

*Proton and Carbon Ion Radiation:*

- Ongoing trials (e.g., UPCC 24309) comparing proton beam vs conventional photon beam
- Potential advantages:
  - Reduced integral dose to normal brain
  - Sharp dose falloff (Bragg peak)
  - Particularly for tumors near critical structures (optic nerves, brainstem)
- Higher cost and limited availability

### Recurrent Meningiomas

**Management of Progression:**

*Establishing Optimal Therapeutic Option:*

- Multidisciplinary decision essential
- **First recurrence:** Surgery usually first option if safely resectable
- **Subsequent recurrences:** Treatment increasingly challenging

*Sequential Treatment Strategy:*

- Surgery → radiation (if not previously given)
- If prior RT → consider re-irradiation (SRS/SRT) for focal recurrence
- Systemic therapy for multiply recurrent, unresectable disease
- Clinical trials encouraged

### Special Situations

**Meningiomas Invading Venous Sinus:**

*Treatment Complexity:*

- Incomplete resection often necessary to preserve venous drainage
  
- Need to weigh:
  
  - Early radiotherapy
  - Surgical resection with sinus sacrifice/reconstruction
  - Observation with close monitoring
- Individualized approach based on venous collaterals, patient factors
  

**Skull Base Meningiomas:**

- Often cannot be completely resected due to cavernous sinus, neurovascular involvement
- Surgery for bulk reduction, symptom relief
- Adjuvant SRS/SRT for residual disease
- Combined approaches common

### 32.2.6 Prognosis and Follow-up

**Recurrence Risk**:
The rate of recurrence and the risk of transformation to malignancy is dependent on the histopathological type of meningioma. Grade I meningiomas have excellent prognosis with complete resection, while higher-grade tumors carry increased risk of recurrence and malignant transformation.

**Surgical Outcomes**:
The recurrence and mortality are lower for intraventricular meningiomas than in other localizations. A higher complete surgical resection rate is achieved than in other localizations. Gross total resection is the gold standard for the treatment of intraventricular meningiomas.

**Complications**:
Many patients can present with deficits due to the tumor location. Postoperative reevaluation is needed as the surgical approach can cause new deficits. Some patients develop neurologic deficits primarily in visual fields.

## 32.3 Multidisciplinary Management

The management of CNS tumors requires a sophisticated understanding of neuroanatomy, tumor biology, and advanced treatment modalities. Multidisciplinary care involving neurosurgeons, oncologists, radiologists, and specialized nursing staff is essential for optimal patient outcomes. As our understanding of molecular mechanisms continues to evolve, personalized treatment approaches hold promise for improving outcomes in these challenging conditions.

Healthcare providers must remain vigilant for early signs of CNS tumors and understand the importance of prompt diagnosis and referral. The integration of advanced imaging techniques, molecular diagnostics, and novel therapeutic approaches continues to shape the future of CNS tumor management. Despite the challenges posed by these tumors, continued research and clinical innovation offer hope for improved outcomes and quality of life for patients affected by these conditions.
