# Chapter 27: Nanotechnology in Cancer

Nanotechnology has emerged as a revolutionary approach in oncology, offering unprecedented opportunities to address the fundamental challenges of cancer diagnosis and treatment. The intrinsic limits of conventional cancer therapies prompted the development and application of various nanotechnologies for more effective and safer cancer treatment. Cancer nanomedicine represents the convergence of nanotechnology, molecular biology, and clinical oncology, creating multifunctional platforms that can simultaneously target, diagnose, and treat malignancies with enhanced precision and reduced toxicity.

The ultimate goal of nanomedicine has always been the generation of translational technologies that can ameliorate current therapies. Cancer disease represented the primary target of nanotechnology applied to medicine, since its clinical management is characterized by very toxic therapeutics. The unique physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, particularly their size-dependent behavior and ability to exploit tumor pathophysiology, have created new paradigms for drug delivery, imaging, and combination therapies.

The field encompasses diverse nanoplatforms including organic nanoparticles (NPs) such as liposomes and polymeric systems, inorganic NPs including quantum dots and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and hybrid systems that combine the advantages of multiple materials. Organic NPs have been vastly explored for several years and fabricated with organic compounds like lipids, protein, carbohydrates, and other organic compounds. Polymer-based NPs, liposome-based NPs, and dendrimers are extensively used as organic NPs in cancer treatment.

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of nanotechnology applications in cancer, focusing on drug delivery systems, imaging modalities, and theranostic platforms that integrate both diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities within single nanoformulations.

## 27.1 Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery

Nanotechnology has emerged as a transformative approach in cancer treatment, offering unprecedented opportunities to overcome the limitations of conventional therapeutic modalities. Cancer nanotherapeutics are rapidly progressing and are being implemented to solve several limitations of conventional drug delivery systems such as nonspecific biodistribution and targeting, lack of water solubility, poor oral bioavailability, and low therapeutic indices.

### 27.1.1 Fundamentals of Nanoparticle Drug Delivery

Jhaveri and Vladimir P. Torchilin Front. Pharmacol., Volume 5 - 2014 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2014.00077 via Wikimedia Commons </small></em></p>

Nanoparticles exploit the unique pathophysiology of tumors, particularly the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. This phenomenon arises from:

* **Abnormal tumor vasculature**: Tumor blood vessels are typically more permeable than normal vessels due to incomplete endothelial cell junctions and reduced pericyte coverage
* **Defective lymphatic drainage**: Impaired lymphatic function in tumors leads to reduced clearance of extravasated materials
* **Size-dependent accumulation**: Nanoparticles in the optimal size range (10-150 nm) can extravasate through leaky tumor vasculature while being retained in the tumor microenvironment

**Passive vs. Active Targeting**

*Passive Targeting*:
* Relies on the EPR effect for tumor accumulation
* Size and surface characteristics determine circulation time and biodistribution
* Stealth properties achieved through polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating to evade immune recognition

*Active Targeting*:
* Employs specific ligands or antibodies directed against tumor-specific receptors
* Amplifies specificity of therapeutic nanoparticles
* Enhances cellular uptake and internalization by cancer cells

### 27.1.2 Types of Nanoparticle Drug Delivery Systems

**Liposomal Drug Delivery Systems**

Liposomes are lipid spheres about 100 nanometers in diameter that have been synthesized for improved delivery of therapeutic agents. Liposome, the first nano-scale drug approved for clinical application, consists of an outer lipid layer and a core entrapping either hydrophobic or hydrophilic drug. They offer several advantages:

* **Biocompatibility**: Composed of naturally occurring lipids
* **Versatile drug loading**: Can encapsulate both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs
* **Controlled release**: Permit continued drug release with increased precision in tumor-targeting
* **Reduced toxicity**: Demonstrated clinical success in reducing systemic toxicity

  <div align="center">

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong> Figure 27.2 Schematic representation of the different types of liposomal drug delivery systems. </strong>   <small> Source: Sercombe, Veerati, Moheimani, Wu, Sood and Hua Front. Pharmacol., Volume 6 - 2015 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2015.00286 via Wikimedia Commons </small></em></p>

*Advanced Liposomal Formulations*:
The PEG (polyethylene glycol) is a hydrophilic polymer that prevents the liposome from recognizing subsequent clearance. Improved pharmacokinetic characteristics, regulated and prolonged drug release, and, most importantly, decreased systemic toxicity are all provided by LNPs. Modern liposomal systems include:

- **PEGylated liposomes**: Enhanced circulation time and reduced immunogenicity
- **Targeted liposomes**: Surface-modified with antibodies or ligands for active targeting
- **Stimuli-responsive liposomes**: pH, temperature, or enzyme-triggered drug release
- **Combination liposomes**: Co-delivery of multiple therapeutic agents

*Clinical Applications*:
In the field of breast and prostate cancer, the application of liposomes has been increasingly common. Multiple paclitaxel liposomes have been demonstrated to have higher anti-tumor efficiency and improved bioavailability compared to free paclitaxel. Liposomes have been used to encapsulate anticancer drugs for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. In melanoma models, phosphatidylethanolamine liposomal cisplatin was proven to have higher cytotoxicity than classic liposomes or free cisplatin, maintaining high intratumoral drug concentration for 72 hours and efficiently delivering 3.6-times more drug compared to the free drug.

**Polymeric Nanoparticles**

Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) play an important role in controlled cancer drug delivery. Anticancer drugs can be conjugated or encapsulated by polymeric nanocarriers, which are known as polymeric nanomedicine. Polymeric nanoparticles (PNs) are molecules usually organized with tunable size into a dense structure with entangling biodegradable polymers presenting thermodynamic stability in an aqueous solvent. The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has approved three PNs: polylactic acid (PLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and polycaprolactone (PCL).

*Advantages*:
Due to their nature, they make possible the customization of many properties, such as hydrophobicity, molecular weight and biodegradability. All of them are completely biocompatible and biodegradable, and have acknowledged degradation curves, making the drug release process of these nanocarriers more accessible to be customized

- Controlled drug release kinetics
- Biodegradable and biocompatible
- Tunable surface properties through copolymer modification
- Protection of encapsulated drugs from degradation

*Advanced Polymeric Systems*:

**Polymersomes**: Polymersomes are a kind of supramolecular aggregates formed by the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules. As drug carriers, polymersomes modify the distribution of drugs in body, prevent drug degradation and inactivation, extend the action time of drugs, and reduce side effects. These vesicular structures offer:

- Superior stability compared to liposomes
- Controllable membrane thickness and permeability
- Ability to deliver both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs
- Stimuli-responsive capabilities including pH, temperature hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction, light, and so on

**Polymeric Micelles**: Self-assembled structures from amphiphilic block copolymers that provide:

- Enhanced solubilization of hydrophobic drugs
- Core-shell architecture for drug encapsulation
- Active targeting through surface modification
- Improved pharmacokinetics and biodistribution

*Clinical Success*:
Albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel NPs (Abraxane®) were approved in 2012 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cancer treatment. It has been used since then for the treatment of a large list of cancer including non-small cell lung carcinoma, metastatic breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.

*PEGylation Strategy*:
Copolymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been used to reduce degradation rate and improve biocompatibility, creating PLA-PEG and PLGA-PEG formulations that evade immune response and extend circulation time.

**Hybrid Nanoparticles**

Hybrid NPs combine the advantages of different NPs, thereby enhancing the function and stability of each drug delivery system. These advanced systems represent the next generation of nanomedicine platforms.

*Lipid-Polymer Hybrid Nanoparticles (LPHNPs)*:
LPHNPs are advanced core–shell nanoconstructs with a polymeric core region enclosed by a lipidic layer, presumed to be derived from both liposomes and polymeric nanounits. Key advantages include:

- High biocompatibility of lipids with the structural integrity provided by polymer NPs, capable of encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs
- Stability, high loading of cargo, increased biocompatibility, rate-limiting controlled release, and elevated drug half-lives as well as therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing their drawbacks
- Effective internalization by cancer cells and avoidance of fast clearance by the reticuloendothelial system

*Clinical Applications of Hybrid Systems*:
Lipid-polymer hybrid NPs have been demonstrated to be a promising drug delivery platform in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and metastatic prostate cancer.

*Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Nanoparticles*:
The combination of organic and inorganic hybrid nano-materials is a common method of NP design. For example, a liposome-silica hybrid (LSH) nanoparticle consists of a silica core and a surrounding lipid layer.

**Carbon-Based Nanoparticles**

Carbon-based nanoparticles are effective in melanoma cells. A single-walled carbon nanotube loaded with doxorubicin induced melanoma cell death in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and reduced tumor development in a xenograft melanoma model.

*Properties*:
* High surface area for drug loading
* Excellent electrical and thermal conductivity
* Potential for photothermal therapy applications
* Challenges with biocompatibility and clearance

**Inorganic Nanoparticles**

*Gold Nanoparticles (GNPs)*:
Gold nanoparticles are known as nontoxic, highly stable, easy to synthesize, and minimally interfering with the biological profile of melanoma tumor cells. Being of high atomic number and electron density, GNPs are optimal contrast agents for computed tomography.

*Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (MSNPs)*:
Mesoporous silica nanoparticles have high drug loading due to high pore volume and surface area, multifunctionalization for targeted and controlled delivery, enhanced cellular uptake and delivers therapeutics at cellular levels in cancer.

*Magnetic Nanoparticles*:
* Iron oxide nanoparticles for MRI contrast enhancement
* Potential for magnetic hyperthermia therapy
* Targeted delivery using external magnetic fields

### 27.1.3 Overcoming Drug Resistance

**Mechanisms of Drug Resistance**

The mechanisms of cancer drug resistance include overexpression of drug efflux transporters, defective apoptotic pathways, and hypoxic environment. Cancer drug resistance represents one of the most significant challenges in oncology, with over 50% of the anticancer drugs used in the clinic today targeted by P-glycoprotein (P-gp).

**ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporters**:
A distinct and predominant mechanism of drug resistance found in cancer cells is the overexpression of specific efflux pumps. These efflux pumps are part of the ABC superfamily of transporters and can translocate substrates (drugs) from the inside to the outside of the cell, thereby reducing intracellular drug accumulation. Key resistance mechanisms include:

- **P-glycoprotein (P-gp)**: P-gp can efflux various anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel out of cancer cells. Overexpression of P-gp is a common feature of most acquired MDR (Multidrug Resistance) in solid tumors
- **Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 1 (MRP1)**: Contributes to drug efflux and resistance
- **Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP)**: Another major efflux transporter

**Nanoparticle-Based Solutions**

*Bypassing Efflux Pumps*:
Considering different mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer, nanoparticles are always designed to inhibit or bypass efflux pumps on the membrane or to enhance endocytosis when recognizing MDR tumors. Strategies include:

- **Endocytic Uptake**: Nanoparticles targeting these mechanisms can lead to an improvement in the reversal of multidrug resistance
- **Co-delivery Systems**: Nano-codelivery systems that can transport traditional chemotherapy drugs and multiple MDR transporter inhibitors. These systems function by interfering with the "efflux pump" functions of cell membrane transporters
- **Size-dependent Mechanisms**: Nanoparticles can deliver drugs directly to intracellular compartments, bypassing membrane transporters

*Multi-compound Nanoparticles*:
Nanoparticles capable to encapsulate or bind multiple compounds at once and release the drugs at the target site either simultaneously or in a predetermined sequence. A novel polymer lipid hybrid nanoparticle (PLN) system was able to circumvent drug resistance. Dox-MMC co-loaded PLN were 20-30-folds more effective in killing MDR cells than free drugs.

*Gene Silencing Approaches*:
Strategies to overcome multi drug resistance by silencing the expression of gene encoding P-gp efflux transporter, i.e., MDR-1 or Survivin through RNA interference (RNAi) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been explored. The mechanisms include:

- **siRNA Delivery**: The siRNAs assembles into endoribonuclease inside the cells containing complexes known as RNA-Induced Silencing Complexes (RISCs) which guides the RISCs to complementary RNA molecules, cleaving and destroying the target RNA
- **Combined Therapeutic Approaches**: Biotin-functionalized nanoparticles co-encapsulating paclitaxel and P-gp targeted siRNA partially overcame tumor drug resistance

*Oxidative Stress Modulation*:
Restoring the oxidative stress sensitivity of MDR cells to enhance the cytotoxicity of antitumor drugs, as well as identifying novel targets to restore cancer cell response to chemotherapies and immunotherapies, may serve as potential therapeutic strategies to overcome MDR.

**Clinical Examples of MDR Reversal**:

*Mesoporous Silica Systems*:
Doxorubicin MSNPs surface conjugated with TAT peptide facilitated intranuclear drug localization in multidrug resistant MCF-7/ADR cancer cells and overcome MDR compared to free Doxorubicin.

*PLGA-based Systems*:
Biotin or folic acid functionalized PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating Tariquidar and Paclitaxel resulted in higher cytotoxicity and inhibited tumor growth in human MDR tumor xenografts compared to Paclitaxel nanoparticles alone.

*Liposomal Co-delivery*:
Transferrin coated liposomes co-encapsulating Doxorubicin and Verapamil exhibited 5 and 3-fold cytotoxicity in Doxorubicin-resistant human erythroleukemia K562 cells compared to non-targeted liposomes and transferrin targeted liposomes with Doxorubicin alone respectively.

### 27.1.4 Clinical Translation and Challenges

**Approved Nanotherapeutics**

Several nanotechnology-based cancer drug therapies have been approved by the FDA and are already on the market. There are five clinically approved nanoparticle chemotherapeutics for cancer and many more under clinical investigation. These include:

- **Doxil®** (liposomal doxorubicin): Doxil was the first nanotherapeutic approved to treat cancer, and it is used for treating ovarian cancer, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, and multiple myeloma
- **Abraxane®** (albumin-bound paclitaxel nanoparticles): Approved in 2012 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cancer treatment for non-small cell lung carcinoma, metastatic breast cancer and pancreatic cancer
- **DaunoXome®** (liposomal daunorubicin)
- 
**Translation Challenges**

*Biological Barriers*:
Mucosal barriers and non-specific absorption are just a few of the challenges encountered in employing nanocarriers for cancer therapy. To overcome these obstacles, a combination of rational nanocarrier design and a fundamental understanding of tumor biology is needed.

The main limitations of nanodrug efficacy are the immunological interactions, the biological barriers that hinder the availability of nanodrugs to the intended target, and the heterogeneity of the biological target.

*Manufacturing and Regulatory Hurdles*:
Issues surrounding complexity in manufacturing and characterization, lack of understanding of in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, acute and chronic toxicity, and cost-effectiveness present significant challenges.

Although diverse nanocarriers have traversed preclinical phases and garnered approvals for human trials, a mere fraction have secured authorization for clinical deployment, particularly those with molecular moieties designed for selective cancer cell interactions.

*Bio-Corona Formation*:
In the biological system, nanomaterials interact with all the encountered biomolecules and dynamically form the so called "bio-corona." The commonly agreed definition of the bio-corona is the multitude and the variety of biomolecules that associate with the surface of a nanoparticle when introduced in a biological system.

**Current Clinical Landscape**:
In 2016, we published a review article on the current clinical landscape of therapeutic nanoparticles, which highlighted over 25 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved nanomedicines and over 45 other nanoparticle technologies that were not FDA/EMA approved but were currently being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials.

*Recent Progress*:
With the integration of nanotechnology into the medical field at large, great strides have been made in the development of nanomedicines for tackling different diseases, including cancers. However, the translation from bench to bedside remains challenging.

**Future Opportunities**

*Precision Medicine Integration*:
By gaining a deeper insight into nano–bio interactions and the personalization of nanomedicines, and through the application of nanotechnology to existing and emerging therapeutic modalities, we will begin to realize the true potential of nanomedicine in cancer.

*Advanced Manufacturing*:

- Continuous manufacturing processes
- Quality by design approaches

## 27.2 Nanomaterials for Imaging and Diagnosis

Recent advances in nanotechnology, accompanied by our growing understanding of cancer biology and nano-bio interactions, have led to the development of a series of nanocarriers, which aim to improve the therapeutic efficacy while reducing off-target toxicity. Nanomaterials have revolutionized medical imaging by providing superior contrast, specificity, and sensitivity compared to conventional imaging agents. These materials exploit unique physicochemical properties at the nanoscale to enhance diagnostic capabilities.

### 27.2.1 Quantum Dots for Cancer Imaging

**Fundamental Properties**

Quantum dots (QDs) are the luminescent nanocrystals (NCs) that provide a multifunctional platform for imaging the biosystems following controlled delivery of therapeutic drugs, proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides, and genes. Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals that emit fluorescence on excitation with a light source. Quantum dots (QDs) are nanoscale nanomaterials that are said to be zero-dimensional because charge carriers are confined so tightly in three directions. Many of their unique properties arise because semiconducting nanocrystals from 2–10 nm diameter are smaller than or equal to their exciton Bohr radius.

*Unique Optical Characteristics*:
Flexible surface chemistry, unique optical properties, high sensitivity, and multiplexing capabilities of QDs certainly make them a most promising tool for personalized medicine:

*Advanced Magnetic Systems*:
Ultrahigh field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF-MRI) (≥7 T) can dramatically boost image resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. The hybrid nanoparticles exhibited better tumor accumulation, a suitable time imaging window, and excellent pH-response T1-T2 dual-mode UHF-MRI performance.

*Advantages over Conventional Contrast Agents*:

- Longer circulation times
- Enhanced tissue specificity

## 27.3 Theranostics and Multifunctional Platforms

Theranostics, the integration of diagnostics and therapies, has become a new concept in the battles with various major diseases such as cancer. Theranostics represents the convergence of diagnostics and therapeutics in a single nanoplatform, enabling personalized medicine approaches through real-time monitoring of therapeutic efficacy.

### 27.3.1 Concept and Design Principles

**Definition and Scope**

Due to the variability and strong adaptability of cancer cells, they could adjust their structure or cell properties to adapt to the surrounding environment and continue to survive, which undoubtedly brings huge obstacles to treatment. However, a single functional nanoparticle drug delivery system seems not to be sufficient for diversified tumor treatment strategies.

The term theranostics was originally coined to describe a treatment platform that combined a diagnostic test with targeted therapy based on the test results. The current nanotheranostics utilize controlled drug vehicles and contain cargo, targeting ligands, and imaging labels for delivery to specific tissues, cells, or subcellular components.

**Multifunctional Design Requirements**

*Design Considerations*:

- Size optimization for EPR effect and cellular uptake
- Surface modification for prolonged circulation
- Controlled release mechanisms
- Biocompatibility and biodegradability

### 27.3.2 Theranostic Nanoplatforms

**Liposomal Theranostics**

By using nanoparticles for both diagnosis and treatment, theranostic nanomedicine has been advanced recently.

Some metals, such as gold (Au) and Gadolinium (Gd), can have antitumor activity besides being an imaging tracer. Bimetallic theranostic nanoparticle, Bi2S3@BSA–Au–BSA–MTX–Cur, in which they used BSA to Bi2S3 nanoparticles by biomineralization and modified them with Au nanoparticles to deliver methotrexate (MTX) and curcumin. Gd-based nanoparticles (AGuIX) were successfully used as both MRI contrast agent and therapy in experimental animal models of melanoma metastases.

*Magnetic Theranostics*:
Red blood cells are attached to iron oxide nanoparticles pre-coated with chlorine e6, a photosensitizer, and then loaded with a chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin, to enable imaging-guided combined photodynamic and chemotherapy of cancer. The characteristic properties of nanoparticles result in their theranostic potential allowing for simultaneous detection of and treatment of the disease, particularly through magnetic hyperthermia therapy combined with MRI guidance.

*Mesoporous Silica Theranostics*:
Multifunctional mesoporous silica nanoparticles (M-MSNs) were designed and synthesized, then the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and antitumor drug doxorubicin (Dox) were adsorbed onto the M-MSNs. The cores of bifunctional Fe3O4-Au nanoparticles in the multifunctional nanocomposites enabled dual-modal MR and CT imaging.

The full power of nanotechnology will require an era of spectacular advances in the development of processes to integrate nanoscale components into devices, accompanied by the ability to do so reliably at low cost.

The field of nanotechnology in cancer continues to evolve rapidly, with promising developments in theranostic platforms offering the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and treatment. As our understanding of nano-bio interactions improves and manufacturing processes become more sophisticated, these technologies are expected to play an increasingly important role in precision oncology. Success will depend on continued collaboration between researchers, clinicians, regulators, and industry to translate laboratory innovations into safe and effective clinical applications.

## 27.5 Conclusion

The field of nanotechnology in cancer represents one of the most promising frontiers in modern oncology, offering transformative solutions to longstanding challenges in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. The intrinsic limits of conventional cancer therapies prompted the development and application of various nanotechnologies for more effective and safer cancer treatment. This comprehensive review has highlighted the remarkable progress achieved across multiple domains of cancer nanomedicine, from sophisticated drug delivery systems to advanced imaging modalities and integrated theranostic platforms.

**Key Achievements and Progress**

The evolution of nanoparticle drug delivery systems has demonstrated significant clinical success, with several nanotechnology-based cancer drug therapies approved by the FDA and already on the market. The development of diverse nanoplatforms—including liposomal systems, polymeric nanoparticles, and innovative hybrid formulations—has addressed fundamental limitations of conventional chemotherapy, including poor bioavailability, systemic toxicity, and drug resistance. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have been shown to play a role in overcoming cancer-related drug resistance through targeting mechanisms that include overexpression of drug efflux transporters, defective apoptotic pathways, and hypoxic environments.

The emergence of quantum dots and advanced imaging nanomaterials has revolutionized cancer diagnostics, enabling earlier detection, real-time monitoring, and precision-guided interventions. Quantum dots provide a multifunctional platform for imaging the biosystems following controlled delivery of therapeutic drugs, proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides, and genes, representing a paradigm shift toward personalized cancer medicine.

Perhaps most significantly, the development of theranostic platforms has unified diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities within single nanoformulations. Multifunctional nanoparticles integrate different functions to further expand the carrier's application, thus achieving two or more capacities, enabling simultaneous imaging, drug delivery, and treatment monitoring with unprecedented precision.

**Current Challenges and Barriers**

Despite remarkable scientific progress, significant challenges remain in translating nanomedicine innovations from bench to bedside. Although diverse nanocarriers have traversed preclinical phases and garnered approvals for human trials, a mere fraction have secured authorization for clinical deployment, particularly those with molecular moieties designed for selective cancer cell interactions. Key obstacles include complex manufacturing requirements, regulatory uncertainties, bio-corona formation, and incomplete understanding of long-term safety profiles.

The heterogeneity of cancer biology continues to pose challenges for universal nanomedicine solutions. The main obstacles to nanomedicine becoming a new paradigm in cancer therapy stem from the complexities and heterogeneity of tumour biology, an incomplete understanding of nano–bio interactions and the challenges regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls required for clinical translation.
