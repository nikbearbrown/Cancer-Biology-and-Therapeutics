# Chapter 7: Epigenetics in Cancer

## 7.1 DNA Methylation and Histone Modifications

Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, play crucial roles in regulating gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. In cancer, these mechanisms are frequently dysregulated, contributing to aberrant gene expression patterns that drive and sustain malignant transformation. Understanding these alterations provides insights into cancer biology and presents opportunities for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

### 7.1.1 DNA Methylation

DNA methylation is one of the most extensively studied epigenetic modifications and involves the addition of a methyl group to the 5' position of cytosine residues, primarily within CpG dinucleotides.

**Molecular Basis of DNA Methylation**

DNA methylation is established and maintained by several key enzymes:

- **DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)**: Catalyze the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to cytosine
  - **DNMT1**: Primarily responsible for maintenance methylation during DNA replication, copying methylation patterns from the parent strand to the newly synthesized daughter strand
  - **DNMT3A and DNMT3B**: De novo methyltransferases that establish new methylation patterns during development and in response to environmental signals
  - **DNMT3L**: Lacks catalytic activity but enhances the function of DNMT3A and DNMT3B

- **Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes**: Mediate active DNA demethylation
  - **TET1, TET2, and TET3**: Oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC)
  - These oxidized derivatives can be removed by base excision repair mechanisms, resulting in unmethylated cytosine

The distribution of DNA methylation in mammalian genomes follows specific patterns:

- **CpG islands**: CG-rich regions often found in promoters of housekeeping and developmental genes
  - Typically unmethylated in normal cells
  - Methylation leads to stable gene silencing
- **Gene bodies**: Often methylated in actively transcribed genes
- **Repetitive elements**: Highly methylated to suppress their transcription and recombination
- **Enhancers and regulatory regions**: Differential methylation contributes to tissue-specific gene expression

DNA methylation establishes transcriptional repression through several mechanisms:

- Direct interference with transcription factor binding
- Recruitment of methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins
- Attraction of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other repressive chromatin modifiers
- Establishment of repressive chromatin structure

**DNA Methylation Alterations in Cancer**

Cancer cells exhibit profound alterations in DNA methylation patterns, characterized by two seemingly contradictory changes:

1. **Global hypomethylation**: Genome-wide loss of methylation affecting:
   - Repetitive elements (LINE-1, Alu sequences)
   - Satellite DNA
   - Intergenic regions
   - Gene bodies

   Consequences include:
   - Genomic instability due to activation of transposable elements and increased recombination
   - Reactivation of oncogenes and imprinted genes
   - Loss of chromosomal integrity
   - Expression of cancer-testis antigens normally silenced in somatic tissues

2. **Focal hypermethylation**: Site-specific gain of methylation primarily affecting:
   - CpG islands in promoters of tumor suppressor genes
   - Regions involved in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and differentiation
   - Genes frequently hypermethylated include:
     - CDKN2A (p16INK4A): Cell cycle regulator
     - MLH1: DNA mismatch repair
     - BRCA1: DNA damage repair
     - APC: WNT signaling regulator
     - RASSF1A: RAS signaling modulator
     - MGMT: DNA repair enzyme removing alkyl groups
     - CDH1 (E-cadherin): Cell adhesion molecule

The combined effect of these alterations is a profound disruption of the gene expression landscape that contributes to multiple hallmarks of cancer.

**Cancer-Specific DNA Methylation Patterns**

Different cancer types exhibit distinct DNA methylation profiles, reflecting their cells of origin and specific pathogenic mechanisms:

- **CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)**: Characterized by widespread hypermethylation of CpG islands
  - Common in colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, and gastric cancer
  - Associated with specific genetic alterations (e.g., BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer)
  - Often displays distinct clinical features and prognosis

- **Cancer-type specific methylation signatures**: Unique patterns of DNA methylation that distinguish:
  - Different cancer types (e.g., leukemia vs. carcinoma)
  - Cancer subtypes (e.g., luminal vs. basal breast cancer)
  - Primary vs. metastatic disease
  - Treatment-responsive vs. resistant tumors

These patterns can serve as biomarkers for cancer detection, classification, prognostication, and prediction of treatment response.

**Mechanisms Driving Aberrant DNA Methylation in Cancer**

Multiple mechanisms contribute to altered DNA methylation in cancer:

- **Altered expression or activity of DNMTs**:
  - DNMT overexpression observed in various cancers
  - DNMT3A mutations common in acute myeloid leukemia
  - DNMT3B splice variants associated with altered methylation patterns

- **TET enzyme dysregulation**:
  - TET2 mutations frequent in hematologic malignancies
  - Reduced 5hmC levels in many solid tumors
  - Metabolic alterations affecting TET activity

- **Recruitment of DNMTs by oncogenic transcription factors**:
  - PML-RAR fusion protein in acute promyelocytic leukemia
  - EWS-FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma
  - MYC in various cancers

- **Disruption of boundaries between active and repressed chromatin**:
  - Alterations in CTCF binding sites
  - Dysregulation of chromatin barrier elements

- **Environmental and metabolic factors**:
  - Chronic inflammation
  - Aging-associated methylation drift
  - Altered availability of methyl donors due to metabolic reprogramming

These mechanisms create and maintain aberrant methylation patterns that contribute to cancer initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance.

### 7.1.2 Histone Modifications

Histones are the core protein components of nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin. Post-translational modifications of histone tails create a complex "histone code" that influences chromatin structure and gene expression.

**Histone Modification Types and Functions**

Histones undergo numerous post-translational modifications, primarily on their N-terminal tails, including:

- **Acetylation**: Addition of acetyl groups to lysine residues
  - Catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs)
  - Removed by histone deacetylases (HDACs)
  - Generally associated with active transcription
  - Neutralizes positive charge of lysines, reducing DNA-histone interaction
  - Creates binding sites for bromodomain-containing proteins

- **Methylation**: Addition of methyl groups to lysine or arginine residues
  - Catalyzed by histone methyltransferases (HMTs)
  - Removed by histone demethylases (HDMs)
  - Functional effects depend on the specific residue modified and degree of methylation:
    - H3K4me3: Associated with active promoters
    - H3K36me3: Marks actively transcribed gene bodies
    - H3K27me3: Repressive mark deposited by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)
    - H3K9me3: Repressive mark associated with heterochromatin
    - H4K20me3: Found in constitutive heterochromatin

  - H2BK120ub: Associated with transcriptional elongation

- **Other modifications**: Include SUMOylation, ADP-ribosylation, biotinylation, citrullination, and crotonylation

These modifications function through two primary mechanisms:
1. Altering chromatin structure by changing DNA-histone interactions
2. Creating or eliminating binding sites for effector proteins containing specific recognition domains (e.g., bromodomains, chromodomains, PHD fingers)

**Histone Modification Alterations in Cancer**

Cancer cells exhibit widespread dysregulation of histone modification patterns:

1. **Global alterations in histone modifications**:
   - Reduction in H4K16ac and H4K20me3: Associated with DNA hypomethylation at repetitive sequences

   - Changes in histone modification profiles creating "epigenetic vulnerability"

2. **Locus-specific alterations**:
   - Gain of repressive marks (H3K27me3, H3K9me3) at tumor suppressor genes
   - Loss of activating marks (H3K4me3, H3K27ac) at tumor suppressor genes
   - Acquisition of activating marks at oncogenes and cancer-promoting genes
   - Aberrant bivalent chromatin domains (containing both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3)

3. **Redistribution of modifications**:
   - Formation of large organized chromatin K9-modified (LOCK) domains
   - Changes in enhancer usage and super-enhancer formation
   - Altered boundaries between euchromatin and heterochromatin

These changes contribute to dysregulated gene expression programs that promote cancer development and progression.

**Mechanisms Driving Histone Modification Alterations in Cancer**

Multiple mechanisms contribute to altered histone modifications in cancer:

   - miRNAs targeting histone-modifying enzymes

These mechanisms create a disturbed landscape of histone modifications that contribute to altered gene expression patterns driving cancer phenotypes.

### 7.1.3 Chromatin Remodeling and Higher-Order Chromatin Structure

Beyond DNA methylation and histone modifications, cancer cells exhibit alterations in chromatin remodeling and higher-order chromatin organization.

**ATP-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling Complexes**

These multi-protein complexes use ATP hydrolysis to alter nucleosome positioning, composition, and density. Major families include:

1. **SWI/SNF (BAF/PBAF) complexes**:
   - Displace or reposition nucleosomes to facilitate transcription factor binding
   - Remarkably, over 20% of human cancers contain mutations in SWI/SNF components:
     - SMARCB1/SNF5/INI1: Biallelic inactivation in rhabdoid tumors
     - SMARCA4/BRG1: Mutations in non-small cell lung cancer and other malignancies
     - ARID1A: Frequently mutated in ovarian clear cell carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, and others
     - PBRM1: Commonly mutated in renal cell carcinoma

2. **ISWI complexes**:
   - Primarily involved in nucleosome spacing and chromatin assembly
   - Dysregulation observed in various cancers, though less frequently mutated than SWI/SNF

3. **CHD complexes**:
   - Diverse functions in transcriptional regulation and development
   - CHD4 mutations found in endometrial and other cancers
   - NuRD complex components altered in various malignancies

4. **INO80 complexes**:
   - Involved in DNA repair, replication, and transcription

  - Potential tumor suppressive roles

- **CENP-A**: Centromere-specific H3 variant
  - Overexpression and mislocalization in cancer can lead to genomic instability

Dysregulation of histone variant incorporation contributes to altered chromatin landscapes in cancer cells.

**Higher-Order Chromatin Organization**

Cancer cells exhibit alterations in three-dimensional genome organization:

1. **Topologically associating domains (TADs)**:
   - Self-interacting genomic regions insulated from neighboring domains
   - Boundaries often marked by CTCF binding sites
   - Disruption can lead to inappropriate enhancer-promoter interactions
   - TAD boundary alterations found in various cancers, enabling activation of oncogenes

2. **Chromatin compartments**:
   - Segregation of genome into active (A) and inactive (B) compartments
   - Cancer-associated compartment switching alters gene expression programs

3. **Nuclear architecture**:
   - Changes in lamina-associated domains (LADs)
   - Altered positioning of chromosome territories
   - Disrupted nuclear bodies (e.g., PML bodies, Cajal bodies)

4. **Long-range chromatin interactions**:
   - Cancer-specific enhancer-promoter interactions
   - Formation of neo-TADs through structural variations
   - Enhancer hijacking activating oncogenes

These alterations in three-dimensional genome organization contribute to dysregulated gene expression patterns that promote cancer development and progression.

### 7.1.4 Interplay Between DNA Methylation and Histone Modifications

DNA methylation and histone modifications do not operate in isolation but form an interconnected network of epigenetic regulation.

**Coordinated Establishment and Maintenance**

DNA methylation and histone modifications mutually influence each other's establishment and maintenance:

1. **DNA methylation directing histone modifications**:
   - Methyl-CpG binding proteins (MBDs) recruit histone deacetylases and methyltransferases
   - DNMT1 interacts with histone methyltransferases targeting H3K9
   - DNA methylation patterns guide specific histone modification landscapes

2. **Histone modifications influencing DNA methylation**:
   - H3K9 methylation recruits DNMTs to establish DNA methylation
   - H3K4 methylation prevents DNMT3L binding, protecting from de novo methylation
   - Active histone marks (H3K4me3, acetylation) generally protect CpG islands from methylation

3. **Mutual reinforcement of silencing**:
   - Repressive histone marks promote DNA methylation
   - DNA methylation stabilizes repressive histone modifications
   - Together they establish self-reinforcing repressive loops

This interplay creates stable epigenetic states that can be heritably transmitted through cell division.

**Disruption of Coordination in Cancer**

The coordination between DNA methylation and histone modifications is frequently disrupted in cancer:

1. **Aberrant targeting of histone modifiers**:
   - Mutated transcription factors redirecting histone-modifying complexes
   - Oncogenic fusion proteins creating novel targeting specificities
   - Cancer-specific long non-coding RNAs misdirecting epigenetic regulators

2. **Uncoupling of DNA methylation and histone modifications**:
   - Bivalent chromatin domains acquiring DNA methylation
   - Aberrant coexistence of active histone marks and DNA methylation
   - Loss of normal boundaries between active and repressed chromatin

3. **Metabolic alterations affecting both systems**:
   - Changes in SAM availability affecting both histone and DNA methylation
   - Oncometabolites (e.g., 2-hydroxyglutarate) inhibiting both histone and DNA demethylases
   - Altered acetyl-CoA metabolism affecting histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility

These disruptions contribute to the epigenetic plasticity of cancer cells, enabling them to adapt to changing environments and selective pressures.

**Epigenetic Reprogramming During Cancer Evolution**

The interplay between DNA methylation and histone modifications drives epigenetic reprogramming during cancer evolution:

1. **Sequential epigenetic alterations**:
   - Initial loss of active marks at tumor suppressor genes
   - Subsequent gain of repressive marks
   - Final DNA methylation locking in silenced state
   - Gradual accumulation of these changes during cancer progression

2. **Epigenetic drift and stochastic changes**:
   - Accumulation of random epigenetic alterations
   - Selection of favorable changes driving cancer evolution
   - Increasing epigenetic heterogeneity within tumors

3. **Epigenetic adaptation to therapeutic pressure**:
   - Reversible epigenetic changes mediating drug tolerance
   - Subsequent stabilization through genetic mechanisms
   - Development of therapy-resistant phenotypes through epigenetic reprogramming

Understanding this complex interplay provides insights into cancer development and opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

## 7.2 Non-coding RNAs (miRNAs, lncRNAs) in Cancer

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) comprise a diverse group of RNA molecules that are transcribed from DNA but not translated into proteins. Among these, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression with significant roles in cancer biology. Their aberrant expression contributes to various aspects of tumor development, progression, and response to therapy.

### 7.2.1 MicroRNAs in Cancer

MicroRNAs are small (approximately 22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to complementary sequences in target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression.

**Biogenesis and Mechanism of Action**

The microRNA biogenesis pathway involves several key steps:

1. **Transcription**: miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II to produce primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs), which contain one or more hairpin structures
2. **Nuclear processing**: The Microprocessor complex, containing Drosha (an RNase III enzyme) and DGCR8, cleaves pri-miRNAs to produce precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs)
3. **Nuclear export**: Pre-miRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5
4. **Cytoplasmic processing**: Dicer (another RNase III enzyme) cleaves pre-miRNAs to produce miRNA duplexes
5. **RISC loading**: One strand of the duplex is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which contains Argonaute (AGO) proteins
6. **Target recognition and silencing**: The miRNA guides RISC to target mRNAs through complementary base pairing, primarily within the 3' untranslated region (UTR)

MicroRNAs exert their regulatory effects through two main mechanisms:
- **mRNA degradation**: When complementarity with the target is high
- **Translational repression**: When complementarity is partial

A single miRNA can target hundreds of different mRNAs, and a single mRNA can be regulated by multiple miRNAs, creating a complex regulatory network.

### 7.2.2 Long Non-coding RNAs in Cancer

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a diverse class of RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins. They exhibit complex secondary and tertiary structures that enable interactions with DNA, RNA, and proteins, allowing them to function as molecular scaffolds, guides, decoys, or enhancers.

**Classification and Mechanisms of Action**

LncRNAs can be classified based on their genomic location and relationship to protein-coding genes:

## 7.3 Epigenetic Reprogramming in Tumorigenesis

Cancer development involves extensive epigenetic reprogramming that contributes to the acquisition and maintenance of malignant phenotypes. This reprogramming affects multiple aspects of cancer biology, from tumor initiation to progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance.

### 7.3.1 Epigenetic Changes During Cancer Initiation

The earliest stages of cancer development are often accompanied by specific epigenetic alterations that create a permissive environment for subsequent genetic changes.

**Pre-malignant Epigenetic Alterations**

Epigenetic changes can occur in histologically normal tissues and precancerous lesions:

1. **Age-associated epigenetic drift**:
   - Gradual accumulation of DNA methylation changes with aging
   - Hypermethylation at specific genes, including tumor suppressors
   - Global hypomethylation affecting repetitive elements
   - Increased variability in epigenetic patterns

2. **Field defects**:
   - Epigenetic alterations extending beyond visible lesions
   - Affecting large tissue areas (fields) exposed to carcinogens
   - Examples: DNA methylation changes in chronic inflammation, UV-exposed skin, tobacco-exposed airway epithelium

3. **Early epigenetic changes in premalignant lesions**:
   - Specific patterns in colorectal adenomas, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ
   - Often affecting genes involved in differentiation and tissue homeostasis
   - Alterations in enhancer activity and higher-order chromatin structure

These early epigenetic changes may predispose cells to malignant transformation by altering gene expression, genomic stability, and cellular identity.

**Epigenetic Priming for Transformation**

Specific epigenetic alterations can create a cellular state conducive to oncogenic transformation:

1. **Silencing of tumor suppressor genes**:
   - Sequential epigenetic inactivation:
     - Initial loss of active histone marks
     -
