Title: Gene Expression from Nascent Transcripts to Protein Product: Image Details\
Description:U2-OS cell showing a bright spot in the nucleus corresponding to nascent RNAs being transcribed on a reporter gene. Two distinct parts of the reporter RNA are tagged: an intron in red and an exon in green. The blue channel shows the protein product of the reporter gene, i.e. the peroxisome-targeted CFP-SKL protein which accumulates in the peroxisomes that are located in the cytoplasm of the cell.\
